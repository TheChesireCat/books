The Caste of Merit

#### Introduction

I n a 2003 episode of the CBS tele vi sion news show _60 Minutes,_ an-

chor Leslie Stahl called the attention of Americans to a diasporic population in their midst. “What is Amer i ca’s most valuable import from

India?” she asked rhetorically. “It may very well be brainpower. Hundreds of thousands of well- educated Indians have come to the U.S. in

recent decades— many to work in the computer and software indus-

tries.” Stahl then specifed further: “The best and brainiest among
them seem to share a common credential: They’re gradu ates of the

Indian Institute of Technology, better known as IIT.” [1]

That same year, Stahl’s laudatory assessment of the IIT system was

echoed in more sardonic terms by Scott Adams, creator of the comic
In a September 15 strip, its Indian character, Asok, announced that as a gradu strip _Dilbert._ ate of an IIT, he was “mentally superior to most

people on Earth.” The following day, Asok elaborated, “At the India

[ _sic_ ] Institute of Technology, I learned to use my huge brain. But I try
not to frighten ordinary people with any gratuitous displays of mental

superiority. For example, I no longer reheat my tea by holding it to my
forehead and imagining fre.” [2] With this blend of new and old racial
ste reo types of the mystical Indian, the IIT was brought more frmly

into American popu lar consciousness.

Stahl’s and Adams’s early twenty- frst- century glorifcation of In-

dian technical knowledge contrasts sharply with attitudes in the late

colonial period. In nineteenth- century British India, the colonial gov-

ernment expressed a clear preference for engineers from England whose

minds were deemed unfettered by the bonds of tradition. Officials over-

seeing the establishment of the engineering ser vices repeatedly lauded

the technical prowess of Eu ro pe ans, at times treating technical knowl-

edge as a form of racial property. A century later, the racial ste reo-

types associated with Indian technical knowledge have been inverted:
from “natives” needing to be schooled in the ways of the modern machine, Indians are now invested with an innate capacity for technical
knowledge.

Over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, India witnessed an-

other signifcant change. Technical knowledge went from being the
purview of Indian lower- caste artisans to becoming integral to state

power, economic development, and upper- caste status. This pro cess

was intimately linked to the rise of engineering. As technological modernization became the emblem of state prowess and societal pro gress,

engineering emerged as a white- collar profession tied to the public dis-

play of modern power. In India, the growth of engineering education
sidelined lower castes and conscripted upper castes with no prior technical skill into the ranks of a new profession. With the postcolonial
state’s fuller embrace of technologically driven development, the divergence between artisanship and engineering was further consolidated,
as was the association between technical knowledge and upper- caste

status.

_The Caste of Merit_ chronicles the rise of engineering education in

3
India in the context of older forms of social and economic stratifcation. More specifcally, it illuminates the relationship between engineering education and caste formation. At the heart of the study are
the Indian Institutes of Technology. Through a historical anthropology
of Indian engineering education, the book tracks how the IITs and their
predominantly upper- caste gradu ates came to be seen as global exem-

plars of Indian technical knowledge.

A key dimension of this story is the complex relationship between

caste and merit. At frst glance, the two terms appear antithetical.
Caste is the social institution most emblematic of ascriptive hierarchy,
while meritocracy is typically understood as a demo cratizing force that

levels inherited privileges and disadvantages. When one looks at the


-----

INTRODUCTION 3

uppermost echelon of higher educational institutions in India, however, caste and merit appear far more proximate, even intimate. Seventy- odd years after in de pen dence, the institutional spaces most iden-

tifed as meritocratic, like the IITs, continue to be overwhelmingly
upper caste in composition. Moreover, attempts at opening up these

spaces to lower castes through affirmative action and other democratizing mea sures are consistently met with fervent opposition, not

in the name of caste but in the name of preserving “merit.” Part of my
concern, then, is to understand how the demo cratic ideal of meritoc-

racy ser vices the reproduction of in equality. I analyze the interplay of

ascription and achievement through which the collective inheritances
of caste have become emblematic of individual merit. In doing so, I

argue that social stratifcation is endemic and not anomalous to contemporary democracy.

The intimacy between caste and merit throws into question the

widespread assumption that identitarianism is principally a politics of
the marginalized. In the Indian context, this assumption is refected
in arguments about caste as a more salient basis of social distinction
and self- defnition for lower than for upper castes. More specifcally,

upper- caste urban professionals are thought to have transcended caste

to adopt more modern forms of identifcation; thus, they are assumed
to be casteless by virtue of their modernity. In part, this is because

since the 1970s, media and scholarly attention has been far more focused on how lower- caste mobilization has transformed the contours

of Indian society and politics. While attention to lower- caste politics

has illuminated the transformative potential of subaltern agency, it has
also produced an equation between caste politics and subaltern identitarianism. As a result, the proliferation of writing on lower castes that
points to caste as a sociopo liti cal category operating through vari ous

registers and at dif fer ent scales has not led to similarly robust engage-

ment with upper- caste self- defnition and maneuver. [4] This is where my

work comes in. I look at the role of engineering education, and the IITs
in par tic u lar, in producing newly consolidated forms of upper- caste af-

fliation. The leveraging of merit, I argue, must be seen as an expression of upper- caste identitarianism that attempts to forestall pro gress

toward a more egalitarian society and derives its legitimacy from a
larger global politics of ascription.

4 THE CASTE OF MERIT

While this book considers the IIT system as a whole, I focus my in-

stitutional ethnography on the study of one IIT— IIT Madras, located

in Chennai, the capital city of the southeastern state of Tamilnadu.
Tamilnadu is a particularly illuminating context in which to look at
the making of upper- caste identity because its history of caste rights

politics—in par tic u lar, the Non- Brahmin and Dravidian movements—

complicated the naturalization of merit and the transformation of
upper castes into casteless moderns. Here, as in other regions with

strong traditions of lower- caste rights, merit has long been understood

as a product of historical privilege and not simply of innate ability.
Moreover, Tamilnadu is the frst postin de pen dence state where upper

castes challenged mea sures to de moc ra tize access to higher education

in the name of both their caste nature and their merit. In this sense,
Tamilnadu calls into question castelessness as a stable structure of
postin de pen dence upper- caste subjectivity.

While the legacy of lower- caste rights movements within Tamil-

nadu has been exhaustively addressed, less noted is how they have
shaped a more far- reaching politics of meritocracy. This book show-

cases Tamilnadu as an impor tant pre ce dent in a proliferating politics

of meritocracy. It asks how the dialectic of lower- caste claims to rights

and upper- caste claims to merit in Tamilnadu might inform an analy sis

of caste more broadly. In foregrounding Tamilnadu as a key site for the
postin de pen dence elaboration of meritocracy, the book calls for a rela-

tional approach to merit. Claims to merit, I will argue, must be under-

stood as responses to subaltern assertion. Analyzing meritocracy in relation to subaltern politics allows us to see the contextual specifcity
of such claims: at one moment, they may be articulated through the
disavowal of caste; at another, through caste affiliation. As I will show

throughout the book, collective belonging and claims to merit are eminently commensurable and become more so when subaltern assertion forces historical privilege into the foreground. Far from the progressive erasure of ascribed identities in favor of putatively universal

ones, then, what we are witnessing today is the rearticulation of caste

as an explicit basis for merit. Moreover, this rearticulation is not simply
the assertion of already constituted caste identities. Rather, claims to
merit generate newly consolidated forms of upper casteness that become the basis for capital accumulation.

INTRODUCTION 5

This back- and- forth movement between the marking and un-

marking of caste within claims to merit suggests the need for greater
nuance in approaching the concept of meritocracy. Even the critical liter a ture that illuminates the workings of caste, racial, or class privi-

lege within seemingly meritocratic institutions ends up arguing for a
better meritocracy where individual talent is considered over and above
social identity. By contrast, my work maintains that it is precisely this
gap between the social life of meritocracy and its universalistic promise
that allows for the retrenchment of privilege. The hope for meritocracy
as the transcendence of identity is a profoundly ahistorical aspiration
that works against the actual redress of in equality. [5]

The Indian Institutes of Technology are a set of twenty- three public

institutions of higher education. The original fve were founded be-

tween 1951 and 1961 through bilateral cooperation with the German,
American, Soviet, and British governments. The frst four each occupied one corner of the new nation: IIT Kharagpur in the east, IIT
Bombay in the west, IIT Madras in the south, and IIT Kanpur in the
north. This distribution of IITs signaled the postcolonial state’s commitment to both regional parity and national integration. Each IIT was
expected to draw more students from its regional social milieu while
being part of an integrated national system of education. The ffth institute, IIT Delhi, followed when the British government offered to help
build a campus in the national capital in 1961. The remaining IITs were

set up between 2001 and 2016, some as new institutions and others

through the conversion of older institutions into IITs. The early twenty-
frst- century mushrooming of IITs was a state response to the gulf

between the number of aspirants and the seats available in the fve original institutes.

The IITs were part of a broader state commitment to technologi-

cally driven modernization as the engine of national development.
From the late nineteenth century, Indian critics leveraged arguments

about “underdevelopment” to point to the inadequacy and immorality of colonial rule. By the early twentieth century, such argu-

ments had taken the form of anticolonial nationalism. Pointing both
to catastrophic events, such as the colonial- era famines, and to the


-----

longer- term immiseration of Indian peasants and workers, national-

ists argued for self- rule as the only path to development. Self- rule was

to reset the terms of economic and po liti cal life by ushering in a more

6
robust state commitment to the linked goals of technological and social development.

Part of the critique of colonial underdevelopment centered on tech-

nical education. Nationalists derided the colonial state for its meager
investment in technical training and charged it with deliberately depriving Indians of the kinds of modern knowledge that would allow
them to achieve economic and social pro gress. One particularly effec-

tive nationalist tactic was to compare Britain unfavorably with its imperial rivals and elevate the latter as better technological exemplars.
Nationalists circumvented the constraints of British imperial hegemony by seeking out other powers, most notably Germany, Japan, and
the United States, as models for a future, technologically driven

nation- state. [7]

With the transition to in de pen dence, nationalist ambitions were

made material in the large- scale state investment in technical educa-

tion. While the goal of universal education accompanied universal
franchise, the pro cess of educational expansion was highly uneven.

From the outset, the IITs were set apart as the uppermost echelon of a

stratifed postcolonial structure of technical training. Deemed “institutions of national importance” by the Institutes of Technology Act of
1961, the IITs’ standing was guaranteed by a set of exceptions. The institutes are directly administered and fnanced by the Indian central
government at far higher levels than are their regional counter parts.

They also fall outside the structure of affiliation to regional universities established in the colonial period, which gives them far greater autonomy in terms of institutional functioning, faculty hiring, and curricular development. Their autonomy was guaranteed in other ways as
well. In the name of ensuring “merit” as the only basis for admission,
they were originally exempted from policies of caste- based affirmative

action applied by regional states to their engineering colleges. These

exceptions have endowed the IITs with the aura of being _in_ but not
entirely _of_ the nation, an extranational orientation underwritten frst
by their founding partnerships with foreign governments and subsequently by their sizable alumni diaspora. Although the IITs were


-----

INTRODUCTION 7

founded to produce a cadre of technical specialists to aid in nation-
building, they quickly became stepping- stones to transnational mo-

bility. As is evident in the _60 Minutes_ program and the _Dilbert_ comic
strip, IIT gradu ates—or IITians, as they are popularly known— are now

the global poster children of Indian education, with many joining the

upper echelons of American industry and academia.

Over the postin de pen dence period, the IITs have become the most

coveted institutions of postsecondary education. The Joint Entrance
Exam (JEE) to gain admission to the IITs is held every year in April and

is a hotly anticipated event. Since the exam was frst held in 1960, the
number of candidates has grown steadily, with over a million students
taking the exam in 2017 and under 3 percent earning admission to the

twenty- three campuses. Every year, exam “toppers” become instant ce-

lebrities, with their faces and “All India Ranks” splashed over news-

papers and billboards. The success of the IITs has also spawned a massive coaching industry to train students for the JEE. With key outposts
in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Rajasthan, coaching
centers now admit students from as early as the seventh grade, who
spend up to fve years mastering a single exam.

Within Indian public discourse, the IITian has become an exem-

plar of intellectual merit, someone seen as naturally gifted in technical
knowledge. What gets occluded in such assessments of the IITian’s innate intelligence and competitiveness are the forms of accumulated
social and cultural capital that have enabled admission to the IITs. The
majority of IITians come from upper- caste families of bureaucrats,

schoolteachers, and academics, where capital has long been held in education. While arguably from middle- class backgrounds, the value of

their accumulated “caste capital” has suddenly spiked due to the reorga ni za tion of late twentieth- and early twenty- frst- century capitalism

around the “knowledge economy.” [8] At the same time, the role of caste
and state in producing IITians has been obscured in favor of their por-

trayal as uniquely meritorious individuals.

In addition to being upper caste, the majority of IITians are also

male. Unlike in regional engineering colleges, where there is more

gender parity in the student body, the percentage of women has never

exceeded ten on any IIT campus. Despite their being a distinct minority, I do not address the unique experience of women in this book. [9]

8 THE CASTE OF MERIT

This is for two reasons. First and foremost, the principal axis of social
differentiation and po liti cal tension when it comes to the evaluation

of merit is caste. Indeed, the women students, faculty, and alumni I in-

terviewed generally espoused similar views on meritocracy as their
male caste counter parts. Second, the overwhelmingly male character

of the campuses makes them ideal sites for understanding how the relationships among upper- caste men and between upper- and lower-

caste men have shaped the meanings of masculinity and meritocracy.

In this sense, I heed recent calls by gender theorists to move beyond
the male– female binary and take into consideration other forms of re-

lationality in the making of gender. [10]

The transformation in the status of technical knowledge and the

upper- caste claim to its most elite institutional spaces prompt the fol-

lowing questions at the heart of this book: How does privilege become
merit? What is the role of technical education in facilitating this process? How do the naturalization of the IITian’s merit and the elevation
of the IITs to emblems of meritocracy inform understandings of caste
difference? And how have these pro cesses shaped the possibilities and

limits of demo cratic transformation in India?

Caste and Historicity

Technical science currently enjoys unpre ce dented prestige as a uni-

versal form of knowledge. At the same time, the ascendance of the
technical has been associated with the cultural supremacy of par tic-

u lar groups and with widening social disparities. Indian engineering,

which emerged within par tic u lar histories of state, caste, race, and cap-

ital, is no exception. Ideas about the role of technology in society and
the place of castes and races within a hierarchical social order informed
colonial state proj ects of technical education. The induction of Indians

into a stratifed structure of training generated intense debate over
whether the technical was indeed a form of knowledge available to all
or an expression of cultural power through which a few benefted at
the expense of others. Even as this debate raged across India’s transi-

tion from colony to nation- state, technical knowledge coalesced as a

necessary solution for perceived social ills of economic underdevelopment and social in equality. [11] By the mid- twentieth century, it had be-

INTRODUCTION 9

come a veritable fetish that embodied the promise of individual, national, and global pro gress. In India, this pro cess of fetishization further

entrenched a stratifed structure of higher education, with the IITs and
their predominantly upper- caste student bodies occupying the upper-

most echelon.

At one level, the adoption of technical occupations by upper castes

is a surprising departure from older caste hierarchies of labor privi-

leging the conceptual over the manual. Within the four- fold _varna_

classifcation derived from Hindu scripture, Brahmins are the “head”
of the social body, the priests and scholars who are the most removed
from the “feet” of Shudra labor. Despite their continued ideological res-

onance, however, such scriptural typologies map poorly onto the historicity of caste practice.

The debate on the historicity of caste in South Asia has long been

polarized between its treatment as a fundamentally religious phenomenon and its treatment as a product of historical and po liti cal eco-

nomic power relations. For many in the frst group, caste is a ritual
order intrinsic to Brahminical Hinduism and defned by notions of purity and pollution. Those who subscribe to this position often assume

an overlap between scriptural and lived dimensions of caste, with the
latter extending from and refecting the categories and princi ples of the

former. Within anthropology, Louis Dumont’s typifed the derivation of the social from the scriptural and set the stage _Homo Hierarchicus_
for the treatment of caste as a form of ritual hierarchy defned by the
For Dumont, the centrality of caste hierarchy as the foundational logic of Indian society marked its difference from the egalitarian West. This insistence on a categorical difference between Orient and Occident led him to disdain materialist preeminence of the Brahmin. [12]
approaches— especially Marxist class analy sis—as the imposition of an

alien secular framework on an essentially hierarchical, ritually ordered
society. [13]

Contra Dumont’s approach to caste as the cornerstone of a Hindu

ritual order is a scholarly lit er a ture that approaches caste sociohistori-

cally. This second body of work is vast; here, I take up two strands in

order to specify my own approach to caste. The sociohistorical approach
to caste can be divided into those who argue for caste as a traditional

form of social organ ization that was disrupted by modernization and


-----

10 THE CASTE OF MERIT

those who contest the assumption of such a baseline by pointing to the
long historical dynamism of caste. Let me frst take up the argument
about the traditionalism of caste.

Authors who argue for caste as tradition typically defne it as a lo-

calized form of social organ ization rooted in endogamy, restricted com-

mensality, and ritual pre ce dence, ele ments that give it a limited elas-

ticity in the face of modernization. For some, the limits of caste are
most evident in changing structural logics. This perspective on caste
as antithetical to modernity was refected across scholarship in the
1950s and 1960s. Anthropologist Richard Fox, for instance, argued that
social changes wrought by pro cesses of urbanization, associational life,

and participatory politics, to name a few, so fundamentally transformed
the workings of caste that it became something new. For Fox, when
the terms of caste relationality shift to interest, competition, or voluntary association, often seen in the scaling up of caste beyond the locality, what scholars require is a theory not of resiliency but of the
“functional demise of a traditional institution under the impact of

modern social change.” [14] Village ethnographers of the 1950s and 1960s
who studied the socioeconomic life of caste also saw fundamental
changes arising from the integration of a local institution into wider
scales of economy and polity. While departing from Dumont’s Orientalism, some— such as anthropologist M. N. Srinivas— echoed his

characterization of caste as a religious institution and interpreted
change as a pro cess of secularization. [15] Whether defned as local or as

religious, these accounts of caste transformation presumed its base-

line traditionalism.

Other work on the breakdown of caste highlights shifts in self-

defnition. This position is most clearly stated by sociologist André
Béteille, who argues that even when caste stratifcation persists as a
structural characteristic of Indian society, the transformation in the
terms of collective self- defnition makes caste less salient. This is es-

pecially true, he maintains, when it comes to upper- caste elites who

have come to think more along class than caste lines. As he puts it,
“Among engineers, doctors, scientists, civil servants and man ag ers, the

obligations to one’s occupation exists in de pen dently of the obligation

to one’s caste and to some extent displaces it. . . . Until the nineteenth

century, Hindu intellectuals could argue with force and conviction


-----

INTRODUCTION 11

about the signifcance and value of caste. Their counter parts of today,

who are still mainly of upper caste, have lost the capacity not only to
explain and justify caste, but even to describe it coherently.” [16] While
for Béteille “caste is no longer an institution of any great strength

among the infuential urban intelligent sia,” he sees it as very much

alive within lower- caste po liti cal mobilization. He thus concludes that

“caste should be attacked for its divisive role in electoral politics rather
than its active role in the reproduction of in equality which is relatively

small and clearly declining.” [17]

Both these positions have some virtue. The scholarship on caste

from the 1950s and 1960s underscores the need to properly account for
transformations in structure and practice without assuming the continuity of caste. The careful attention in this work to shifts in organizational forms and modes of association is critically impor tant to my

own research on higher education. In par tic u lar, I have found accounts

of the nineteenth- century caste association as an instance of caste con-

solidation very helpful for thinking about how caste can scale up
under new historical conditions. While I depart from seeing this shift
as a movement from tradition to modernity, the larger point about attending to sociology and not just sentiment is well taken.

More problematic is Béteille’s argument about caste self- defnition.

Reducing caste to its discursive life discounts its continued structural
workings as a determinant of access and opportunity. Furthermore,
seeing the social reproduction of upper- caste professionals solely in

terms of class obscures the intersections of class and caste. Fi nally,

taking at face value the terms of upper- caste self- defnition disregards

the fact that caste does not necessarily speak in its “own” language.
Rather, to paraphrase cultural theorist Stuart Hall, it can be lived
through other modalities. [18] Most striking is Béteille’s unwillingness
to ask why caste appears to have declined in social meaning for elites
just when it has assumed a po liti cal charge for non- elites.

Béteille’s insistence on parsing caste and class is echoed in a more

recent book by anthropologists Chris Fuller and Haripriya Narasimhan
Fuller and Narasimhan offer an exhaustive and rich account of the transformation of on Tamil Brahmins, to which my work is indebted. [19]

cultural capital to position themselves within shifting circumstances
to ensure their economic success. All the way through, we get a nuanced understanding of caste as a dynamic social pro cess that is irre-

ducible to a set of traits or a worldview. This makes especially puzzling their conclusion that Tamil Brahmin professional success is
best seen as a form of class reproduction. Indeed, Fuller and Narasimhan cite Béteille in arguing that “caste has ceased to play an active
part in the reproduction of in equality, at least at the upper levels of

the social hierarchy.” This begs the question of why, as they themselves underscore, Tamil Brahminness becomes synonymous with [20]
middle classness. To their credit, Fuller and Narasimhan are careful
to hold at arm’s length Tamil Brahmin claims to ascriptive intelligence in order to argue for a properly sociohistorical account of caste;
the book is resolutely antiessentialist. However, this leads them to an
insistence on the declining relevance of caste even when their own
empirical material suggests other wise.

These approaches to caste are a laudable departure from Dumont’s

structuralism. However, in challenging Dumont, they are too quick
to reject continuities in caste sociology and sentiment that are a product
not of an under lying cultural logic but of historical pro cess. To under-

stand caste continuities in pro cessual terms, I have turned to scholar-

ship on the longer history of shifting structures, forms, and meanings.
Some scholars hark back to the precolonial and colonial periods to illuminate long- standing transformations of caste practice and self-

defnition in relation to shifts in the organ ization of sovereignty and

po liti cal economy. Rather than a stable structure destabilized by the

advent of “modernity,” they argue that caste dynamics have always
been informed by interest, competition, and shifting scales of consolidation. In such work, we see the vari ous idioms through which social

pre ce dence has been established, ritual purity being only one of them. [21]

Others offer a genealogy of Dumontian structuralism itself. They

illuminate the pro cess by which, in the nineteenth century, the “feld

view” of caste was overtaken by a “book view.” In this pro cess, they

argue, the understanding of caste as a social formation constituted by
economic and po liti cal power was displaced by one that derived its es-

sence from Sanskrit texts and Hindu religiosity. The book view not
only allowed for a theological conception of caste divorced from its so-

cial life but generated a notion of cultural consensus belied by an
actual history of caste strug gle. [22]

_The Caste of Merit_ builds on the latter body of work to argue for

the history of caste as one of transformation, marked by signifcant
shifts in expressions of self- defnition, mechanisms of distinction, and

scales of group formation. Yet this does not mean that caste has given
way to some other form of social classifcation, such as class. While
class is certainly an impor tant form of stratifcation, continuities of

caste affiliation, stigmatization, and ascription within the most modern

23
institutional and social spaces reveal the irreducibility of caste to economic differences. As I hope to show, such caste practices extend a
long history of strug gle into a con temporary politics of meritocracy,

where contestation has taken new forms.

Labor and Value

B. R. Ambedkar, the Dalit leader and architect of the Indian Constitution, argued that the hegemonic power of caste lay in its operation as
a form of “graded in equality” in which the gradation of status differ-

ences ensured the participation of groups lower down the ladder. [24]
Caste mobility has typically taken the form of a resignifcation of group
status through economic advancement, religious conversion, migration, or po liti cal patronage. [25] Through such strategies, caste groupings

have transformed the meanings of collectivity by shifting their position relative to other groups. Despite, or perhaps because of, the nature

of such claims, caste has remained a stratifed structure that more
often animates contestation over status than calls for a wholesale erad-

ication of the system. While claims to higher status do not always reinstate the preeminence of the Brahmin, they do reproduce a societal
structure in which enhancing one’s relative standing is a more commonly conceived path to rights than achieving equality.

One enduring princi ple of graded in equality is the stratifcation of

labor. Rather than simply an expression of ritual status, caste stigma
has typically worked through the degradation of labor. [26] It is no acci-

dent that the sites where caste distinctions are most rigidly enforced
are ones with the most oppressive labor conditions. [27] To put it differ-

ently, caste is a princi ple of stratifcation whose mechanisms are both

symbolic and material. Often, groups claiming a higher status reject
forms of stigmatized labor that were the basis of their subjugation. We

see this, for instance, in the hope expressed by Dalits— the former

untouchables who occupy the bottom rung of the caste ladder—
that rural to urban migration might sever their ties to the “everyday
tyranny” of agrarian caste relations and allow them the “freedom” of
equal participation in labor markets. [28] We also see it in the instances

of lower- caste assertion buttressed by narratives of a prelapsarian past

of high birth and valued labor. [29] That these forms of aspiration and as-

sertion are perceived as threats to caste reproduction is evident in the
vigilante vio lence aimed at brutally suppressing Dalit and lower- caste

spatial and social mobility by incarcerating them within oppressive social relations of labor. [30]

It is against this backdrop, then, that the upper caste resort to a form

of labor previously associated with the low- born becomes particularly

striking. As I will show in Chapter 1, this counterintuitive embrace of

technical knowledge is best understood as a result of the wholesale

transformation in the status of engineering during the colonial period.
The rise of engineering rested on practices of distinction separating low
from high, the manual from the conceptual, and artisanship from the
professions. Moreover, the impact of colonialism in “racializing” caste
was particularly signifcant for the upper- caste turn to the technical

sciences. [31] Earlier, changes in practice could lead to expulsion from the

caste fold. The racialization of caste under colonialism as a social form

rooted in birth, heredity, and endogamy allowed for a new level of fexibility. As a result, even dramatic changes in practice, like the adoption of ritually prohibited occupations, came to be accommodated
within the same caste category. Together, the distinctions that underwrote the rise of engineering and the association of caste with heredity,
not practice, allowed the upper castes ease of entry into a new profession. By the mid- twentieth century, artisanship and engineering were

poles apart, with engineering perceived as a coveted, high- status pro-

fession best suited to the high- born. The value of engineering as a pro-

fession was thus intimately linked to its disassociation from the
“tainted” technical labor of the lower castes.

It was not just the “purifcation” of engineering through its asso-

ciation with state power and societal pro gress that aided its embrace

by upper castes. So, too, did the promise of capital accumulation. The
history of engineering is one of spatial and social mobility through
which agrarian upper castes became part of an urbanized middle class.

In the colonial period, upper castes were conscripted into engineering

and became a class of white- collar professionals. This pattern continued

under postcolonial state developmentalism. As we will see in Chapter 2,

postcolonial state investment in technical education and the elevation
of the engineer as nation- builder par excellence made engineering a

key instrument of cap i tal ist transformation and a particularly lucra-

tive choice of occupation. Upper castes with histories of literacy and
education fourished as salaried professionals tied to the economic
engine of the developmental state. Initially, postcolonial engineers
followed their colonial pre de ces sors into public sector employment.

However, the ambition of public sector careers gave way in the 1990s,

when national policy shifted toward economic liberalization. The

deregulation of trade and industry overlapped with the Internet technology revolution, leading to skyrocketing salaries among elite engineering gradu ates. These rising fortunes starkly illuminate the

“payoff” of caste. While caste has always been a mechanism of both
social and economic stratifcation, the catapulting of upper castes into
the ranks of the corporate elite throws the economics of caste into
sharp relief, allowing us to clearly see caste as a form of capital.

In his essay “The Forms of Capital,” sociologist Pierre Bourdieu

calls for more attention to the dif fer ent forms of capital— economic

(money), cultural (cultivation and credentials), and social (connections)—
and the mechanisms through which one is converted to the other.
Without such an analy sis, he argues, the social world of “accumulated

history” would “be reduced to a discontinuous series of instantaneous

32
mechanical equilibria between agents who are treated as interchangeable particles.” Bourdieu offers a particularly insightful analy sis of

embodied cultural capital, those accumulated effects of family and

class history that become an integral part of the person. “ Because

the social conditions of its transmission and acquisition are more disguised than those of economic capital,” he argues, “it is predisposed

to function as symbolic capital, i.e. to be unrecognized as capital and
recognized as legitimate competence.” In this way, symbolic or embodied cultural capital “manages to combine the prestige of innate [33]

property with the merits of acquisition.” [34] However, Bourdieu points
out that there is an inherent instability to embodied cultural capital

that is stabilized through the alchemy of institutional recognition in
the form, for instance, of academic qualifcations. Such institutional
mediation not only stabilizes cultural capital but also endows it with
greater legitimacy by appearing to be autonomous of accumulated history and social relationality. Fi nally, it makes cultural capital into a

currency more easily traded in the marketplace. [35]

The story of the IITs is a particularly stark instance of how institu-

tionally mediated cultural capital operates as currency. Among Indian
engineers, it is the IITian who is most associated with global market
success. As I show throughout the book, the IITs have underwritten
the capital accumulation of upper castes by reconstituting the inheritances of family and community into a form of achievement legible in

the marketplace. In the frst postin de pen dence de cades, IIT alumni

were still very much a part of the state’s developmental ethos as professional nation- builders. The 1960s generation of Madras IITians

whose stories I will chronicle in Chapter 4 derived their sense of pro-

fessionalism and elite standing from a connection to state- led nation-

building. At the time, the most coveted forms of employment were in

public sector civil and mechanical engineering, a trend reinforced by
the role of West Germany in setting up IIT Madras. For the institute’s
early gradu ates, exposure to the German model of hands-on engi-

neering challenged caste sensibilities privileging mental over manual

labor. Chapter 3 will probe this period at length to contextualize 1960s

contestations over the signifcation of labor within long- standing de-

bates about whether engineering was best thought of as practical or

conceptual knowledge.

As with other elite engineers, IITians’ link to the developmental

state was short lived, but even more so. Unlike their counter parts in

other engineering colleges who trained their sights on the private sector
in the aftermath of Indian economic liberalization, the fortunes of IIT
alumni had risen even earlier through a steady exodus from the 1970s

to the United States. Their incorporation into American academia and
industry and subsequent cele bration as entrepreneurial successes pro-

duced an antipathy toward the developmental state and faith in the

“ free market,” which were a bellwether for the widespread changes that

INTRODUCTION 17

would sweep Indian society from the 1990s. Not only did diasporic
IITians do very well abroad, but they also began to strategize around
securing their own market recognition. Chapter 7 will detail how the

Silicon Valley boom set the stage for the coalescing of a new ethnic
commodity: the “technological Indian” whose most vis i ble signifer

was “Brand IIT.” [36] In shoring up the brand value of the IITs, diasporic
alumni have done their part to suture the link between pedigree and
market and ensure that caste remains a site of capital investment.

Merit and Caste

There was an added twist to the social and economic elevation of engineering and its embrace by upper castes. With the postcolonial transition, the more explicit colonial- era link between engineering and

upper- caste status gave way to a dif fer ent set of associations. The ad-

vent of po liti cal democracy made less evident the social relations of

caste that had made engineering into a form of conceptual knowledge
best suited to the high- born. Even as their position as the princi ple ben-

efciaries of engineering education consolidated, upper castes began
to leverage technical knowledge as a marker not of their caste status
but of their individual merit. How did this transformation of privilege
into merit occur?

“Merit” is a loaded term, one that does similar po liti cal work as an

earlier discourse of republican “virtues and talents.” In this sense, Indian meritocracy is part of a much longer history of modern po liti cal

thought and its reconciliation of universal equality and naturalized social hierarchy. As historians of the Enlightenment have shown, virtues and talents became the focus of phi los o phers and po liti cal writers

concerned with engendering a new society based on princi ples of

nature and reason. [37] They argued that a sociopo liti cal order founded

on these princi ples would best ground the emergent notions of the re-

publican citizen and the enlightened society. Most— like Jefferson,

Rousseau, Montesquieu, and Diderot— presumed that hierarchies would

necessarily remain within a democracy; now, however, they would be
rooted in legitimate differences and not the legacy of family or rank.

Despite the widely circulating language of equality and universal rights,
they argued that the “natu ral superiority” of some over others— men


-----

18 THE CASTE OF MERIT

over women, adults over children, or Eu ro pe ans over other people—

made them best suited to govern. Even for those like John Adams, who

fretted about the substitution of an aristocracy of birth with an “aristocracy of talent,” there was little question that stratifcation would

persist as an integral part of the social order, in large part because of

differences in people’s “natu ral” endowments. For eighteenth- century

ideologues, naturalized difference became a key alibi for the perpetuation of social hierarchy after the advent of republican democracy. [38]

As with eighteenth- century republicanism, postin de pen dence India

witnessed heated debates over how to reconcile the formal ideal of
equal citizenship in the new republic with per sis tent social hierarchies.

At the same time, Indian republicanism was far more radical than its
eighteenth- century pre de ces sor. Universal adult franchise symbolized

a radical break with colonial subjecthood. Moreover, departing from
the explicit colonial invocation of caste as the orga nizational basis of

society and economy, postcolonial statesmen and planners consciously
sought to overcome not just colonial “underdevelopment” but also the
purported social barriers to Indian modernity.

Caste was one of these social barriers. Unlike the colonial treat-

ment of caste as a foundational category of Indian society, postcolonial statesmen viewed caste as antithetical to modern social life, with
no place in a demo cratic polity. Caste thinking, with its basis in hier-

archy, stigma, and segregation, was to be rooted out in favor of civic

princi ples of equality and fraternity. But much like the hierarchies em-

bedded within eighteenth- century Enlightenment thought, some In-

dians were thought to have achieved this enlightened consciousness

of castelessness sooner than others and were thus suited to lead. Al-

though the material legacies of caste continued to structure postin de-

pen dence life, those upper castes who were its greatest benefciaries

were the frst to proclaim their own transcendence of caste.

Sociologist Satish Deshpande has called for more analy sis of how

upper castes are rendered casteless in India. He points out that the story
of how upper castes transform “their caste capital into modern capital”
is not well known because “it runs with the grain of the dominant

common sense.” When it is seen and heard, it is in other guises: “It
appears to be a story about something _other than caste,_ like the story
of nation- building for example, or the story of a great and ancient tra-

INTRODUCTION 19

dition modernizing itself.” [39] By contrast, Deshpande continues, the
po liti cal leveraging of caste by lower castes is a recurrent, publicly

debated theme. The result of this asymmetry, he maintains, is that
upper castes are naturalized as the “legitimate inheritors of modernity,” while lower castes are hypervisible as the illegitimate purveyors
of caste.

It is undoubtedly true that non- elites have embraced caste as a ve-

hicle of empowerment and that collective mobilization for lower- caste

rights in both formal and informal po liti cal arenas has changed the

contours of Indian society and politics. However, I echo Deshpande’s
insistence that this only underscores the need for work on how caste
operates at the other end of the spectrum. There is no question that

many upper- caste individuals think of themselves as modern subjects,

or at least as subjects with sincere commitments to universalistic
ideals of equality, democracy, and rationality. At the same time, these

individuals are able to inhabit a universal worldview precisely because

a history of accumulated advantages allows them a unique claim to
certain forms of self- fashioning. Whereas at an earlier moment, status

might have been more explic itly tied to caste, the social bases of merit

continue to be constituted in ways that allow the same social groups
to inhabit merit as an embodied ideal. This begs the question of how
castelessness as a subjectivity is produced, and what its relationship is
to caste belonging in the postcolonial, demo cratic pre sent. [40]

_The Caste of Merit_ addresses the role of the IITs in transforming

caste privilege into merit. Chapter 6 will do so through a close look at

affirmative action, or reservation. In postin de pen dence India, redress

for per sis tent social inequalities found expression in a system of caste-

based affirmative action, in which reserved seats, or quotas, were set

aside for the “socially and educationally backward.” [41] But even as more
and more ink was spilled in debating the indices of social backwardness, the inheritances that underwrote achievement slipped out of
view. In contrast to lower- caste subjects, whose eligibility for reserva-

tion defned them in terms of collective histories of disadvantage,
the upper-caste subject was classifed as an individual citizen defned by merit. The absenting of caste from the postcolonial administrative classifcation of upper- caste students marked a key transition

in official parlance that came to intersect in critical ways with their


-----

20 THE CASTE OF MERIT

self- fashioning as meritocratic moderns. Moreover, the admissions

categories of “general” and “reserved” generated their own caste effects within and beyond higher education by producing caste distinction and discrimination at a dif fer ent scale. As a result, the antagonists

of the debate over educational equality are now these consolidated

caste groupings of the general and the reserved. Even when the fner
gradations of in equality give way, caste stigma persists through these

consolidated forms of caste.

The reconstitution of upper castes as casteless moderns was further

facilitated by the modern mass examination, which funneled aspirants
to higher education into dif fer ent tiers of technical training. Unlike

earlier pro cesses of se lection that explic itly favored the high- born elite,

the mass examination was underwritten by an ideology of middle- class

achievement in which labor would fnd its just rewards. Despite the

social patterns of success and failure to which it gave rise, the mass
examination appeared to exist above the po liti cal fray as an objective

instrument of evaluation. Chapter 5 will delve into the role of the

modern examination and its fnely calibrated system of ranking in constituting merit as an index of individual achievement and an egalitarian system. In par tic u lar, it illuminates the place of the IIT entrance

exam as the most fetishized mea sure of merit because of the pre-

sumed asocial character of technical knowledge and the sheer scale
of the exam.

As previously noted, the transnational mobility of IIT gradu ates to

the United States has added another layer of complexity to this dynamic. In Chapter 7, we will see how, in the diasporic cir cuits of the

knowledge economy, caste privilege is consistently misrecognized as
middle- class labor and racial talent. No longer benefciaries of caste or

the developmental state, IITians in the United States are seen simply
as naturally gifted, if hardworking, Indians. Contributing to this aura
is the rise of entrepreneurship with its ideologies of self- made success.

The sizable presence of IITians in the Silicon Valley boom of the 1980s
and 1990s has endowed them with a mystique as the most risk- free sites

of capital investment. [42]

Constitutionalism, mass examinations, and global market success

have all mediated the transformation of the IITian’s caste privilege into
merit. At the same time, other trends have complicated the reconsti-


-----

INTRODUCTION 21

tution of upper castes as casteless, meritocratic moderns. The naturalization of upper- caste merit has not gone unchallenged. Through the

twentieth century, constitutional amendments, policy initiatives, and

regional politics have variously illuminated the per sis tence of caste as

a structural determinant of opportunity and success. These interven-

tions have advanced competing notions of equality that presume not
the level playing feld of formal democracy but the historical accumulation of advantages and disadvantages. Attention to histories of accumulation has been particularly pointed in regions like Tamilnadu,
where a politics of lower- caste assertion has interrupted the transfor-

mation of privilege into merit by re- marking upper castes as _castes._ In

this sense, Deshpande’s account seems too neat when he argues that
for upper castes, “caste- qua- caste has already yielded all that it can and

represents a ladder that can now be safely kicked away. Having encashed its traditional caste- capital and converted it into modern forms

of capital like property, higher educational credentials and strongholds
in lucrative professions, this section believes itself to be ‘casteless’
today.” [43] The case of Tamilnadu suggests that castelessness might be
less a fait accompli and more an aspect of upper- caste self- defnition,

which has always shifted according to circumstances. Moreover, the
marking of caste is not necessarily done at the expense of claims to
merit. Rather, the commensurability of caste and merit within these

claims shows that meritocracy is not always a universalistic politics.

Ascription and Achievement

The interplay between self- marking and un- marking within upper-

caste claims to merit is most evident when we attend to the relationality of caste. Thinking of caste formation relationally not only allows
us to see caste as the product of longer historical relationships but also
illuminates the impact of demo cratic politics. [44] The proliferation of

rights discourses and politics, the extension of universal franchise, and
the entry of new social groups into spaces previously monopolized by
upper castes have posed real challenges to caste hierarchies. Although
in some ways formal po liti cal arenas and the broader cultural sphere

have witnessed the entry and ascendance of lower castes, elite education
and the expanding private sphere both within and beyond India have


-----

22 THE CASTE OF MERIT

ser viced the reconstitution of caste privilege by other means. In this

sense, we might think of elite and private transnational and domestic
arenas as spaces of upper- caste fight, retrenchment, and accumula-

tion away from the pressures of lower- caste politics.

When we think about strategies of upper- caste retrenchment in re-

action to lower- caste rights, the role of Tamilnadu stands out as an

impor tant pre ce dent. As the discursive target of the Non- Brahmin and

Dravidian movements, Tamil Brahmins in par tic u lar came to be hy-

pervisible and their claims to knowledge inextricably linked to caste
privilege. Their explicit marking as caste subjects has in turn produced
a heightened consciousness among Tamil Brahmins of their own caste
belonging. For them, however, being Brahmin is an expression of both
modernity and merit. Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 will take up dif fer ent sides of

this regional story. Chapter 3 addresses the impact of Non- Brahminism

and Dravidianism on the regional po liti cal milieu. Chapter 4 looks

more closely at how regional caste tensions shaped the frst generations

of students at IIT Madras. Chapter 5 considers the larger landscape of
regional secondary education and exam coaching within which Tamil
Brahmins in par tic u lar have shored up their claim to IIT Madras. And

Chapter 6 addresses the centrality of the reservation system to the
making of Tamil Brahminness.

These chapters also address a shift in the politics of meritocracy

from a regional to a national scale. What was once a regional dialectic
of lower- caste claims to rights and upper- caste claims to merit has

assumed national proportions. Now, it is not only Tamil Brahmins who
claim merit as a caste characteristic and articulate ascriptive notions
of skill and intelligence. The expansion of lower- caste rights politics

to the national scale— particularly the rise of Dalit and Other Back-

ward Class (OBC) po liti cal parties in the 1990s and the expansion of

reserved quotas in 1990 and 2006— has witnessed a similar expansion

of an identitarian politics of meritocracy. Now, upper castes across
India have embraced merit as a collective caste trait that distinguishes
them from lower castes.

The return to ascription as the explicit basis of achievement is one

instance of what others have identifed as the neoliberal commodif-

cation of identity. [45] Whereas the explicit invocation of particularistic
genealogies as a basis for social worth or market value was once dis-

INTRODUCTION 23

credited, we are witnessing the resurgence of claims on these grounds.

Culturalist, genealogical, and even ge ne tic claims to merit have be-

come an increasingly common feature of the twenty- frst- century

global knowledge economy. Additionally, the suturing of identity and
merit is generating newly consolidated forms of upper casteness.

Upper Casteness

One of my key arguments is about the impact of engineering education on the scale of caste belonging and affiliation. Since anthropologist Bernard Cohn’s writings on the making of colonial knowledge, a
number of scholars have elaborated on the workings of the Indian ethnographic state. Much of this work addresses the social life of state administrative categories by tracking how enumeration and classifcation travel beyond the worlds of law and policy to shape forms of
collective self- defnition. As a result, we better understand both the

dynamism of identity and the intimacy between state and society.
When it comes to caste, the bulk of this scholarship has looked at how
governmental practices have shaped the contours of subaltern self-

defnition and collective expression, giving rise to lower- caste rights

movements and po liti cal parties. [46] Much less has been written about

the traffic between state classifcation and upper- caste politics. To the

extent that upper- caste identitarianism has been addressed, it has gen-

erally been through analyses of Hindu nationalism. [47] Most accounts
of caste consolidation as a sociopo liti cal pro cess have been limited to

lower castes and Dalits. By contrast, my concern is with how both the
tracking of social groups into dif fer ent tiers of technical training, and

constitutional mea sures to redress caste in equality through reserved

quotas in higher education, have produced consolidation among upper
castes.

To understand upper- caste consolidation, I have turned to scholar-

ship on the production of whiteness in the United States. This also
helps explain my choice of the awkward neologism “upper casteness.”
Historian Matthew Frye Jacobson’s work on the incorporation of vari ous

Eu ro pean immigrants— Irish, Italians, Poles, Ashkenazi Jews— into the

category of “white” speaks eloquently to a new order of distinction
that emerged in the United States over the course of the twentieth


-----

24 THE CASTE OF MERIT

century. [48] Through this period, Jacobson argues, the assimilation of
Eu ro pe ans into the category of white replaced all earlier racial divi-

sions among them with the result that the distinction between black
and white became the paramount racial division. The now commonsense, phenotypical understanding of white thus emerged out of two
associated pro cesses: the consolidation of Eu ro pe ans into one unifed

racial category and that category’s distinction from blackness. The production of whiteness as a consolidated category has also been taken
up by others, who argue that its assimilationist logic extended certain

privileges of race to marginalized Eu ro pean immigrants while pre-

cluding cross- race solidarities. [49] This logic was resolutely material and

structural: racial privilege was reproduced through legally authorized
practices of housing, policing, and schooling, among others, through

which the “possessive investment in whiteness” was solidifed as a
form of property.

As with twentieth- century whiteness, upper casteness has been

forged through both state and private sector initiatives and in opposition to lower castes. These consolidated categories of upper and lower

caste have acquired an outsized importance in the po liti cal life of caste

that in many ways overshadows the salience of caste at a smaller scale.
Moreover, upper casteness has an incorporative logic that allows for
the accommodation of nonideal upper- caste subjects and even some

lower- caste subjects. However, this fexibility— its basis in the inter-

play of incorporation and exclusion— generates an incessant politics of

evaluation and distinction that speaks to the anx i eties of privilege and

the uncertainties of its reproduction.

We see both the incorporative and exclusionary logics of upper

casteness around the IIT admissions pro cess. The general category of

admissions is putatively open to anyone with “merit” even while it is
underwritten by the assumption that upper castes are uniquely meritorious. Since the 1990s, the expansion of the JEE coaching industry
and the implementation of new quotas for lower castes has produced
the need to police the bound aries of merit like never before. The result

has been a relentless effort to match bodies to meanings in order to
distinguish the “true” IITian from vari ous “imposters.” These diag-

nostic rituals convey understandings of caste qualities that are assumed to attach to par tic u lar meritorious and nonmeritorious bodies.


-----

INTRODUCTION 25

They capture the qualitative dimensions of being upper caste— those

meanings of caste read off the body— that are so key to the quotidian

life of affinity and stigmatization. They also point to the nonfungibility of the general category. In Chapter 6, we will see that when

Dalit and lower- caste students lay claim to merit by pointing to their

admission through the general category— which several of them do

consistently and vocally— they are legible only as exceptions. More-

over, these students are routinely compelled to erase the complexity

of their own history and participate in producing a phantasmatic imaginary of backwardness that collapses a dense feld of signifcation into
a binary opposition.

It is not only backwardness that is fattened in order to produce

merit as exclusively upper caste. So, too, is upper casteness. We see this
most clearly in Chapter 5 with the case of students from coaching centers whose presence is unsettling because they are the wrong kind of

upper caste. These are upper- caste students whose family histories are

at odds with the IITian norm of urban professionalism. Their unfamiliarity with En glish and open embrace of regionalism run counter to

the cosmopolitanism that is supposed to distinguish upper from lower.
The discomfort their presence produces speaks to the phantasmatic
quality not only of backwardness but of upper casteness. In these micro-

negotiations over who is a “true” IITian, we see the centrality of caste
consolidation to the con temporary meanings of meritocracy. Meri-

tocracy is constituted through the very interaction between caste
and castelessness and between ascription and achievement.

Ultimately, this book argues that meritocracy offers a win dow on

the relationship between capitalism and democracy. As historians and
anthropologists of Africa, Asia, and the Ca rib bean have long argued,

capitalism works through social differentiation. Rather than producing
abstract labor, cap i tal ist pro cesses have always been elaborated through

ascriptive understandings of race, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality. To
put it differently, capitalism is a culturalist as well as an economic
epistemology that builds on and generates in equality. What, then, is

its relationship to democracy? As with capitalism, democracy embodies
a tension between individuated and collective conceptions of the social body. The formal conception of individual rights is in tension with
the inherited privileges and disadvantages that underwrite demo cratic

26 THE CASTE OF MERIT

social stratifcation. In dif fer ent contexts and depending on the po liti cal

pressures in play, law and policy are more or less able and willing to
address such contradictions between the inheritances of history and
formal equality.

Their overlapping structures and ideologies have led many to dis-

miss democracy as a mere tool of capitalism. However, the Indian
context calls for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship
between the two. Rather than simply ser vice cap i tal ist accumula-

tion, what we see in the politics of meritocracy is a battle over the very

terms of demo cratic membership and transformation. Democracy—

as ideology and a set of structures for making po liti cal claims— does

provide leverage for subaltern politics that challenge the status quo.
As a result, structures of in equality do not seamlessly reproduce them-

selves. Rather, upper- caste claims to merit are emblematic of an ongoing

“war of maneuver” in reaction against lower- caste assertion. [50] Upper-

caste maneuvers— universalistic on the one hand, identitarian on the

other— are part of a broader dialectic of caste contestation elaborated

on a transnational scale. The story of merit at the IITs thus illuminates
caste hegemony, not as a stable structure of Indian life but as a pro cess

and a politics.

#### The Colonial  Career
 of Technical Knowledge

T o understand the elevated status of engineering in India today re-

quires a foray into the pre- independence past. The career of technical

knowledge from the mid- nineteenth to the mid- twentieth century is

one of shifts from guild to state, shopfoor to classroom, and lower to
upper caste. These shifts were conditioned by pro cesses at an imperial

scale: the transfer of power from the East India Com pany to the British

Crown in 1857, inter- imperial industrial competition over the latter

half of the nineteenth century, efforts to minimize the cost of colonial

rule, and nationalist critiques of underdevelopment. Over a century,

technical knowledge went from being the purview of lower- caste arti-

sans to becoming integral to state power, economic development, and
upper- caste status. With the postcolonial transition and a fuller embrace

of technologically driven development, the divergence between artisanship and engineering was further consolidated.

What does this account add to our understanding of colonial South

Asia? The scholarship on South Asia has extensively covered the relationship between technology and power. Scholars have addressed how
British technological dominance reinforced colonial racial hierarchies,
consolidated state administrative authority, and advanced the proj ect

of human mastery over nature. [1] Less considered, however, is how these

interventions interacted with a preexisting landscape of hierarchically

27

28 THE CASTE OF MERIT

ordered, caste- based forms of knowledge and skill. Similarly, the vast

lit er a ture on continuities and shifts from colonial- era po liti cal economy

to Indian developmentalism does not directly address the infuence of
a caste worldview on development imaginaries and practices. This is
also the case for the much more limited social scientifc scholarship

on engineering. While the stratifed structure of the colonial engineering corps has been referred to as a “quasi- caste” or even a “caste”

system, the actual role of Indian caste differences in the making of co-

lonial technical education is unclear. [2] Consequently, we know little

about how caste assumptions and practices shaped technological de-

velopment in general, and technical education more specifcally, and
the impact of these pro cesses on meanings and practices of caste. [3]

Here I take up one piece of this larger story: the evolution of Indian

technical education in a context of imperial transformation, and the
centrality of caste imaginaries to that pro cess. We will see how, in the

early nineteenth century, the po liti cal terrain shifted to allow for

the development of modern education in British India. This new arena
witnessed key debates around engineering education, with dif fer ent

constituencies arguing over race, caste, technical aptitude, and the
proper balance of mental and manual skill. Gradually, engineering came

to be associated with classroom- based theoretical knowledge and pro-

fessional ser vice to the state and disassociated from an earlier British

orientation around guild apprenticeship and private industry. The professionalization of engineering was part and parcel of the entrenchment
of the colonial state as an infrastructural and administrative apparatus.
The shift from shopfoor to classroom also clinched the identity of
the British Indian engineer as a member of a colonial elite who was to
embody the hierarchies of the colony. Initially, this meant racial exclusivity. But dual pressures— from England to do colonialism “on the

cheap” and from nationalists charging Britain with underdevelopment—
led to a lifting of the racial glass ceiling and entry of upper castes into
the engineering ser vice.

We will also consider the other side of technical training: indus-

trial schooling for lower castes. While frst intended as a response to
the embattled status of artisanal castes under colonial free trade, in-

dustrial schooling eventually shifted toward an emphasis on producing

labor for new industries. By the transition to in de pen dence, the engi-

THE COLONIAL CAREER OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE 29

neering profession had effectively displaced lower castes with histories
of technical skill and knowledge in favor of upper castes who previ-

ously disdained hands-on labor. Overall, the chapter will track how the

divergence between professional engineering and industrial schooling
both deepened the penetration of the colonial state and economy, and
sutured the link between caste status and technical knowledge.

Modernizing Education

In British India, the question of whether and how to promote technical

education was repeatedly raised beginning in the mid- nineteenth

century. Both colonial and nationalist advocates of Indian modernization pointed to the predominance of classical literary education and
the need to cultivate other “practical” felds of study in the colony. The
debate over the approach and scope of technical education revealed a
range of positions on preferred forms of tutelage, what kinds of knowledge were perceived as most benefcial or transformative, and who was

best suited to acquire this knowledge.

Before 1857, the colonial government moved slowly on provisions

for modern education, primarily because of the power ful Orientalist

lobby and an overall conservatism toward the existing status quo.

Clause 43 of the East India Com pany Act of 1813 spelled out two goals:

“The encouragement of the learned natives of India and the revival and
improvement of lit er a ture; secondly, the promotion of a knowledge of

the sciences amongst the inhabitants of that country.” The com pany’s

Court of Directors determined that the existing institutional structures of formal education for social elites would remain, as the more
extensive spread of modern public education would be incompatible
with “the customs and mentality of the people.” [4]

Criticism of Orientalist approaches to education arose early. In 1823,

Bengali modernizer Rammohan Roy wrote to Lord Amherst, the
governor- general of Bengal, criticizing the proposal for establishing a

Sanskrit college in Calcutta and urging the government to instead
“promote a more liberal and enlightened system of instruction.” Roy
felt that “the establishment of Sanskrit schools specializing in metaphysical niceties was regression to a pre- Baconian universe” and de-

stroyed “the sanguine hopes of the native intelligent sia for courses in


-----

30 THE CASTE OF MERIT

mathe matics, philosophy, chemistry, and anatomy.” [5] But his argument

fell on deaf ears. In 1824, the colonial government opened a Sanskrit
college in Calcutta and another in Delhi for “instruction in the three
classical languages of India.”

The critique of colonial education policy leveled by Indian modern-

izers like Roy resonated with the position adopted by utilitarians

within the East India Com pany directorship. In an 1824 despatch, they

stated that the government’s original approach to education was “fundamentally erroneous. The great end should not have been to teach

Hindu learning, but useful learning. . . . In professing, on the other

hand, to establish seminaries for the purpose of teaching mere Hindu
or mere Mohamadan lit er a ture, you bound yourselves to teach a great

deal of what was frivolous, not a little of what was purely mischievous,

a small remained indeed in which utility was in any way concerned.”
Thomas Macaulay’s 1835 “Minute on Education,” which argued for a
shift from classical Indian to modern Eu ro pean knowledge, tipped the

scales and initiated a broader re orientation of Indian education. In-

spired by Macaulay, Lord Auckland in 1840 called for education
“through the medium of En glish and the Vernaculars, in accordance

with modern ideas.” This modernizing vision was encapsulated in an
1854 despatch sent by Charles Wood, the President of the Board of Control of the East India Com pany, to Governor Lord Dalhousie, which

advanced a new approach to Indian education as the general diffusion
of Eu ro pean knowledge. Known as “Wood’s Despatch,” it highlighted

the limitations of the dominant literary approach and urged professional training in law, medicine, and civil engineering through the
establishment of vocational colleges and schools of industry. A noteworthy section attributed by some to John Stuart Mill argued the need
for “useful and practical knowledge suited to every station in life” and

underscored the critical role of the state in disseminating this form of
knowledge “to the great mass of the people who are utterly incapable

of obtaining an education worthy of the name by their own unaided
efforts.” [6] The point was clear: unlike in the metropole, the state in the
colony would be integral to the advancement of modern education.

Before the 1854 despatch, there was already one engineering college

in operation: the Thomason College of Civil Engineering at Roorkee.

THE COLONIAL CAREER OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE 31

The college was founded in 1847 in response to the demand for civil
engineers to aid the construction of the Ganges Canal in the Northwest Provinces. 7 After the despatch, three more engineering colleges

followed in quick succession: the Poona College of Engineering in 1859,
the Madras Civil Engineering College in 1862, and the Sibpur College
of Engineering in 1880. All four colleges were tied to employment in

the Department of Public Works, which expanded rapidly after the In-

dian Rebellion of 1857–1858 as part of the shift in authority from the
East India Com pany to the British Crown. The promotion of engi-

neering as useful knowledge was thus intimately linked to the goal of
expanding the presence and power of the colonial state.

After the 1880s, the colonial government made a more concerted

effort to extend technical training beyond the collegiate level through
industrial schooling. Industrial schooling was intended to mitigate the
effects of colonial free trade by retraining and channeling displaced ar-

tisans into new industries. Unlike engineering, it targeted a very differ ent segment of the native population: not disaffected elites but dis-

possessed subalterns who, as missive after missive stated, were

“destined for industrial and commercial pursuits.”

Colonial technical education policy thus advanced in two direc-

tions: the frst toward building a native cadre of college- educated en-

gineers, and the second toward equipping artisans for modern indus-

tries. Policy, however, was not practice. Both college engineering and
industrial schooling advanced in fts and starts. Engineering was stymied by the enduring En glish suspicion of the classroom as an appro-

priate site for training engineers and by an institutional investment in
maintaining a racial hierarchy within the colonial engineering corps.
Industrial schooling, on the other hand, suffered setbacks because of

the tug of war between interventionism and laissez- faire and because

of indecision over whether to promote small- or large- scale industry.

Despite the slow growth of technical education, there were some

clear outcomes of the pro cess. Most importantly, the development of

technical training along two tracks was informed by and, in turn, reinforced caste differences. By the advent of in de pen dence, the status of

technical knowledge had transformed; while engineering was now an
upper- caste intellectual aspiration intimately tied to nation- building,

artisanship had been demoted to a form of unskilled labor seen as far

less instrumental to economic development.

Engineering Education: Defning the Professional

In advocating for the growth of professional engineering in India, colonial statesmen typically invoked the metropolitan engineer as forerunner and model. But in nineteenth- century England, there was little

scope for technical training as a pro cess of formal education. The pio-

neers of industry were workingmen trained by apprenticeship and self-

taught in industrial science, and the leading engineers were products

of the old system of guild pupilage. There was widespread conviction

that factories, offices, and workshops were the nation’s “true technical

schools.” [8] This older vocational approach to engineering as a form of
shopfoor learning persisted into the twentieth century, long after en-

gineering had become an academic discipline in other parts of Eu rope.

In 1901, Edward Buck, who was commissioned by the colonial government to conduct a study of technical education in India, offered a
scathing critique of this En glish conviction: “In England people are

still content to repeat that trades cannot be taught in a school. The
Austrians and Germans have discovered that trades cannot be efficiently taught _without_ a school. In many towns, employers are required
to send their apprentices to a technical school for a certain number
of days a week, and a breach of the law is followed by fne or imprisonment. Nor are the schools confned to a few large towns. In Austria,
in par tic u lar, a great point is made of carry ing technical training to

the small towns and even to the villages.” [9] But even Buck’s criticism
of outmoded En glish ways was ultimately less about technical edu-

cation as a path to professionalization and more as a necessary supplement to the existing set of trades. It was this argument for a more robust and systematic investment in the trades that he took from the
Austrians and Germans and recommended for India.

In India, opposition to bringing technical training under the

auspices of the Department of Education lasted into the early twentieth century. In 1908, John Wallace, the editor of the _Indian Textile_

_Journal_ , submitted this opinion to the Industrial Conference held at
Ootacamund:


-----

THE COLONIAL CAREER OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE 33

The cause of the pre sent state of technical education in India is

traceable to the constitution of the Educational Department which
is controlled by University men, whose ideas of education are so
built upon reading and writing as a foundation that they have
overlooked the true relation of technique to science in a country
whose industrial training is still in a very backward condition. In
every other country, which has reached any industrial eminence,
the knowledge of handicraft preceded by many generations, that of
reading and writing. India has yet to recover from an educational
impulse in the wrong direction. Reading and writing, which have
been of incalculable value for certain classes, are not of use at all,
and they become positively pernicious when they entice young men
away from a sure living by handicraft to the overcrowded ranks of
clerical labor. [10]

Wallace’s statement is striking for its social and developmental advocacy. His was a call for building technical education from the foundation of India’s handicraft traditions. As he saw it, technical education
had been usurped by those who, with their faith in book learning, had

little understanding of “technique.” In attempting to make technical
education a mirror of what they knew, these “University men” were

on shaky ground and sure to fail. Instead, Wallace urged a resuscitation of technical education as embodied technique through which India
could advance more surely along the path to industrialization.

This sentiment in favor of “technique” as the appropriate form of

knowledge for the majority of Indians was echoed time and again in
government commissions and resolutions from the mid- nineteenth

century. Initially, even those closely associated with the development

of professional engineering institutions expressed this conviction. In
1857, Lieutenant Winscom, the frst principal of the Madras College of
Engineering, stated his preference for those with experience in hands-

on work in this missive to the director of public instruction:

My own idea would lead me very much to prefer a rough steady man
with good constitution and with strong natu ral good sense to a

weakly bookworm. It is from men of the former stamp that the great

En glish Engineers have sprung with very few exceptions. . . . I con-

ceive therefore that men to be taught to excel in the Engineering profession in this country are not those who have all their lives been


-----

34 THE CASTE OF MERIT

engaged in study, but rather fresh clever lads from the country, sons
of overseers, Maistries, etc. who have seen and taken interest in

works in pro gress. [11]

Winscom’s preference was shared by Major Richard Strachey, who

averred that “no amount of college teaching will make the Engineer.

It will merely ft young men to become Engineers when they have the

opportunity afforded them of acquiring practical knowledge.” [12]

As indicative of the dominant British view of engineering as an en-

deavor of “the practical man,” only three of the frst ten presidents of
the Institution of Civil Engineers (founded in 1818) were university

trained men. As late as 1869, Col o nel Chesney of the Corps of Royal

Engineers retorted that “the very name of a college for engineering
would be utterly abhorrent to the ideas of most civil engineers,” as “a
college to them conveys the notion of a place where students are to be
crammed with mathe matics and theory and are to learn nothing else.” [13]

It was only in 1903 that the Institution of Civil Engineers placed the
sanction of the profession behind the system of higher education in

engineering.

It is curious that so much of the re sis tance to the classroom came

from military men, since the military was the exception to the rule of
workshop learning. The formal training of officers for the Corps of
Royal Engineers, the engineering arm of the British army, has a history dating back to 1741 with the establishment of the Royal Military
Acad emy at Woolwich. Subsequently, the directors of the East India

Com pany founded a military acad emy of their own at Addiscombe in

1809 to train officers, frst for the engineer and artillery corps, and later

for the cavalry and infantry. Until it closed in 1860, the acad emy at Ad-

discombe produced the engineer officers of the British Indian Army.
Ironically, the same military officers produced by this academic
training resisted the development of engineering as classroom knowledge in India. It took a change from military to civilian oversight of
engineering to more effectively tie it to the classroom.

The colonial state’s shift toward civilian technical education in the

classroom occurred virtually in tandem with similar changes in
England. Imperial rivalries were key to this change. As Home Secre-

tary A. P. MacDonnell noted in July 1886, the policy shift followed from
the great industrial exhibitions of the 1850s. At the frst one in London

in 1851, metropolitan policy makers recognized the “defciencies as regards art of the En glish workman, and as regards science of the En-

glish manufacturer.” [14] This concern was affirmed during the fourth
exhibition in Paris in 1857, after which the British Commission of In-

quiry admitted that “the En glish workman is gradually losing the race,

through the superior intelligence which the foreign governments are
carefully developing in their artisans. The education of Germany is the
result of national organ ization which compels every peasant to send

his children to school, and afterwards affords the opportunity of ac-

quiring such technical skill as may be useful in the department of industry to which they are destined.” 15 Beginning in 1853, but more so
after the 1857 industrial exhibition, in which Britain was shown up by
France, Germany, and Amer i ca, a more concerted effort was made to

bring technical training within the purview of formal education.
England began to introduce technical courses under the auspices of the

Department of Education. Even after this point, however, prejudices

against classroom learning of technical skills persisted, and universities that opened engineering facilities saw very low student numbers.

The 1854 despatch, which advocated a scheme of technical and in-

dustrial education for India, followed a mere three years after the 1851

exhibition. In this sense, the introduction of formal engineering education in India can hardly be seen as an instance of a temporal lag
between metropole and colony. In many ways, India was quicker to
move ahead with the institutionalization of engineering as part of a
modern system of classroom education.

The greater speed with which engineering was institutionalized as

part of Indian higher education was largely due to its being a state
proj ect. The difference from the prevailing model in England, where

engineering was a private sector practice, was stated early on by commissioners of the Public Works Department of Madras, who argued
that “education, and more emphatically this species of education, is
not at such a point in this country, that the Government need merely
to fx a standard of qualifcation, and invite candidates to compete
for admission into the ser vice; it must itself provide all the training

36 THE CASTE OF MERIT

This argument for a kind of colonial “affirmative action” gave the government of India a far more central role in the promotion of engineering than machinery.” [16] England. Even after Governor- General

Dalhousie delinked engineering from the Military Board in 1855, it
remained under the auspices of the newly created Department of

Public Works.

The institutionalization of engineering as classroom education

shifted the model of training away from England and toward other

industrialized states. In his writings on his days as a student at

Roorkee’s Thomason College of Civil Engineering in the early 1870s,
William Willcocks, a leading irrigation engineer of the late nineteenth
century, observed that they “ were taught on the sound lines of the

Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, and not on the ridicu lous lines generally

in vogue in England at the time.” One key dimension of the shift in

training from shopfoor to classroom was the elevation of mathe matics.

Technical education planners felt that the status of engineering could
only be secured through “a sense of shared expertise drawn from a
common body of ‘theoretical’ (i.e., mathematical) published research.
The increasing prestige and professionalism of irrigation engineers in
India in the late nineteenth century was thus rooted particularly in

the conjoining of the prestige of mathe matics to the prestige of ser vice

This was a far cry from Winscom’s midcentury argument for an engineering corps composed of the “sons of overseers [and] to the state.” [17]
Maistries.” In the colony, engineering had come to serve a very differ ent purpose. Instead of hands-on learning, it was becoming an elite

persuasion associated with conceptual knowledge and state power.

By the 1940s, the earlier, more pragmatic approach to engineering

was regarded as something of an embarrassment. Emblematic of this
sentiment was the observation in a Punjab Irrigation Department
manual from 1943 that despite the “amazing courage and resources”
of mid- nineteenth- century military engineers, “their knowledge of ir-

rigation and hydraulics was nil.” In retrospect, they were seen as

working largely by trial and error. While the Punjab’s Bari Doab and
Sirhind canals had been built with “beautifully drawn and skillfully
colored plans,” they had “shocking mistakes of design.” [18] It was only

now, armed with the science of engineering and its mathematical formulas, that the true professional was thought to come into his own.

THE COLONIAL CAREER OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE 37

By the mid- twentieth century, then, technique had morphed from being

a basis for engineering into a barrier to its true expression.

_Race, Caste, and Class in the Making of the Indian Engineer_

Alongside the concern over the suitability of engineering for the classroom, there was another repeatedly raised question: the suitability of

the Indian for engineering. Although technical skill was more clearly
evident among artisans, the emerging consensus over engineering as
classroom learning and its link to the prestige of the state made literate upper castes the principal targets of this new knowledge. To paraphrase John Wallace, in elevating the classroom as the new site of
technical knowledge, education planners marginalized those who had

technique in favor of those schooled in reading and writing.

There were also other reasons to push for engineering as a new focus

of upper- caste education. Its proponents saw engineering as an an-

swer to the saturation of elite employment in law and government.
The imbalance between felds of knowledge was evident in the distribution of colleges. When Lord Curzon arrived in India in 1899 to
assume the viceroyalty, there were 191 colleges, of which 145 were arts

colleges and the rest professional colleges, including law (30), teaching
(5), agriculture (3), medicine (4), and engineering (4). For colonial offcials like Lord George Hamilton, the secretary of state, [19] there was

an immediate po liti cal reason to direct Indians away from lit er a ture

and philosophy. As he put it peevishly, literary education, “joy of the
Babu and anglicized Brahmin . . . produces a wholesale mass of dis-

contented individuals who, if they cannot fnd government employment spend their time in abusing the government which has educated
them.” [20]

Despite the expansion of colonial public works from the 1850s, the

consolidation of a civilian classroom orientation to engineering by the
late nineteenth century, and its promotion as an antidote to nationalist

sentiment, the growth of a professional cadre of Indian engineers moved
in fts and starts. This was largely due to the existence of a racial glass
ceiling expressed in British assumptions about Indian technical incompetence. Indians were prevented from getting the training they needed

to rise up the ranks of the colonial engineering ser vice because of

built-in prejudices against native technical capacity. [21] Sweeping


-----

38 THE CASTE OF MERIT

generalizations about Indians were commonplace. W.T. Thornton, sec-

retary of the Public Works Department, for instance, maintained that
the poor output of the existing engineering colleges was not due to any
failing on the part of the government but simply that “the taste for civil
engineering is likely to be of slow growth among the people of India.”

He predicted that Indians would “take the place of Eu ro pean engineers

but very gradually.” [22] Even those who came to support arguments in

favor of increased Indian repre sen ta tion in the colonial ser vices, such

as Alfred Chatterton of the Indian Industrial Commission, questioned
Indians’ capacity for technical knowledge. “The subtle mind of the
Hindu,” Chatterton observed, “delights in philosophic speculations
and in unraveling the intricacies of legal enactments; it is pos si ble that

the same qualities applied to scientifc investigation would afford their
possessors equal gratifcation in probing the hidden mysteries of natu ral

phenomena. That the practical aspects of such inquiries would appeal to
them is less certain.” [23] For Chatterton, it was this lack of practical sense,
the fact that Indians “do not possess in any very large mea sure the grit

and common sense which mark the engineer,” that ultimately kept colonialism in place. “It is fairly certain that if they did possess these

qualities,” he opined, “they would not want our assistance to maintain
peace and order.” Chatterton singled out engineering in par tic u lar as

the cornerstone of self- rule. As he put it, “when India can do her own

engineering work and carry on her own industries, then, and then only,
she will be able to govern herself, and our dominion, in its existing form

at any rate, will come to an end.” For Chatterton, engineering and de-

mocracy proceeded apace. “With the gradual development of local self-
government,” he argued, “ there will as suredly be a corresponding de-

velopment of engineering skill and a gradually decreasing demand for
external assistance. The pro gress in one direction will mea sure the pro-

gress in the other.” [24]

While the racial overtones of such judgments are difficult to deny,

there was also a caste sociology in play. With the shift to classroom
education, the “Indians” who were the object of official scrutiny were

the upper castes, not the artisans whose practical orientation and technical capacity were evident. While regarded as well suited for higher

education, upper castes were also seen to be singularly lacking in prac-

tical skills.


-----

THE COLONIAL CAREER OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE 39

In 1911, Edwin Atkinson and Tom Dawson, authors of a report on

technical education in India, opined that “the general disinclination
for hard physical labor on the part of the average educated Indian is

the chief cause of failure in the technical education of the India of
today.” [25] They went on to valorize the British ideal of on- the- job

training: “ Every technically trained student must be prepared to start

on the lowest rung of the ladder, show his superiority by hard work
and technical knowledge, and having made himself indispensable and
a commercial asset to his employer, he will then rise by the natu ral

laws of supply and demand.” Another official report on education explained that “individual bhadralog (upper caste [26] people) do not, in fact,

wish their sons to be mistris (carpenters). Each thinks that the sons of

27
others, not his own son, may be diverted from the competition for employment in the clerical and professional market.” A member of the
Indian Industrial Commission echoed this characterization in more
oblique terms: “Our trou ble in India is that the practical side of in-

dustry is not at pre sent considered an honorable calling by any but a

fraction of the section of the Indian community who should be attracted to our large industries, and until there is more inclination on

the part of the Indian student to ‘take his coat off,’ the advantages of
technical education are bound to be to a great extent nullifed.’ ” [28]

Even when British officials were willing to grant Indians technical

profciency, they found other ways to point to the prob lem of caste sen-

timent. One repeated trope was how caste affinity and social embeddedness undermined the professionalism of Indian engineers. For instance, one British engineer expressed discomfort with Indian colleagues
and superiors by complaining that they “would listen to the grievances
only of fellow caste men when on inspection tours.” [29] Sir Charles
Harrison, chief engineer of the large- scale Sukkur Barrage proj ect in

Sindh Province, told the Simon Commission deputized to assess the
effects of the Montagu- Chelmsford Reforms of 1919 that Indian engi-

neers, “though often technically efficient, were subject to outside

infuences pressing on them to make a partial distribution of water,

infuences which often made it difficult for them to carry out their
duties as efficiently and impartially as they would wish to do.” [30]

Such commentary on the predilections of Indian engineers ex-

pressed several things at once: that the Indian engineer was expected


-----

40 THE CASTE OF MERIT

to be drawn from among the educated upper castes; that Indian hierarchies of caste were set in stone; that elite diffidence was the principal

reason for the absence of industrialization; and that En glish society,

by contrast, was a meritocracy where hard work paid off. In effect, the
simultaneous shift to the classroom and the enduring infuence of an
older model of hands-on skill produced a double exclusion. On one side
were lower castes whose social standing made them ill- suited for the

classroom. On the other side were upper castes whose intellectual and

social orientation made them unft for the practicalities of technical
work and, by extension, for the higher ranks of engineering. Who, then,
was left to populate colonial engineering?

In short, the En glish. But it was not only Indians who were subject

to critical scrutiny; so, too, were the En glish. [31] The British engineer in

India was expected to ft a social mold suited to the racial hierarchies
of empire. Two successive schemes to supply metropolitan expertise
for the Indian engineering ser vice clearly illustrate this expectation.

With the expansion of colonial public works in the 1850s, the newly
opened India Office in London turned to England for technical experts.

In 1858, Lord Stanley, the secretary of state for India, started a new
scheme for the recruitment of British engineers for Indian public works.
These recruits came to be known as “the Stanley engineers.” They
were expected to take the Indian civil ser vice exam, supplemented

by a short “conversion course” at one of the four Indian engineering
colleges.

These Stanley engineers proved to be disappointing to men like Col-

o nel Chesney, who found them poorly educated and unable “to pass an

examination involving any knowledge of the princi ples of mathe matics

or theoretical mechanics.” [32] More signifcantly, they were lower class,

a concern that was articulated by the Public Works Department (PWD)
in an 1870 resolution expressing concern that “the class of men asked
for are not such as is expedient to introduce in large numbers into India,
where, in the intercourse between Eu ro pe ans and Natives, more con-

sideration for the feelings and prejudices of the latter is desirable than

33
such of the former as have not had their manners softened by education are much in the habit of showing. Chesney and others worried

that metropolitan recruitment done without care to ensure an appropriately elite cadre would upset British India’s balance of social classes.


-----

THE COLONIAL CAREER OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE 41

What they desired were En glish engineers who were both gentlemen

and workers and who could fulfll the demand for technical labor

without destabilizing the racial and class hierarchies of the colony.
Moreover, as is evident in the stated sensitivity to Indian “feelings and
prejudices,” they repeatedly used native prejudice as an alibi for pursuing conservative policies that belied British claims to enlightened
government.

When the Stanley scheme failed, the British made a second attempt

to preserve the racial character of colonial engineering. In 1870,
Chesney was appointed by the secretary of state to found the Royal
Indian Engineering College at Cooper’s Hill near London to train
students for the Indian engineering ser vice. In addition to being “of

sound constitution and of good moral character,” applicants had to
pass a test covering mathe matics; natu ral science; Latin; Greek;

French; German; the works of Shakespeare, Milton, Johnson, Scott,
and Byron; and En glish history from 1688 to 1756. In effect, it was a test

of gentle manliness.

For all their talk of technical competence, then, when colonial

policy makers pictured the ideal public works engineer, they thought
not only of a man with practical skill but also of an En glishman with

a par tic u lar class bearing. These racial and class requirements for ad-

mission into the colonial civil ser vices, ones that were refected more

broadly across the British Empire, appear to have satisfed the supporters of Cooper’s Hill in India. In 1878, a military officer on the
North Bengal State Railway crowed that “a better, abler and more gentlemanly set of men than the recently joined men from Cooper’s Hill
could not have been sent out to India.” [34]

Despite such exalted opinions of Cooper’s Hill gradu ates, by the

1880s, this scheme had failed to produce the desired results. As a fnal
attempt to preserve the racial hierarchy within colonial public works,
the Aitchison Commission of 1886–1887 recommended that the civil
ser vice be divided into an upper imperial and several lower provincial

ser vices, with only the latter open to Indians. However, none of these

initiatives arrested the decline in the metropolitan hold on Indian engineering. Cooper’s Hill was f nally closed in 1907, although its gradu-

ates dominated the upper echelons of colonial engineering until the

1930s, when the last batch of alumni came to the end of their careers. [35]


-----

42 THE CASTE OF MERIT

The exorbitant cost of staffing British Indian ser vices with Eu ro-

pe ans generated opposition not just from nationalists but from the

British themselves. In 1880, Viscount Cranbrook, the secretary of state,
insisted in a strongly worded letter to the viceroy that “all reasonable
facilities for entering on a career as Civil Engineers in the ser vice of

Government should be offered to Natives.” His opinion, however, remained in the minority for de cades after, despite the fact that the 1917

report of the PWD Reor ga ni za tion Committee also underscored the

need to recruit Indian engineers to all levels of the public works bureaucracy. Only with the Morley- Minto Reforms of 1919 did a commit-

ment to participatory governance through “Indianization” begin in
earnest.

These repeated exhortations to open the ser vices to Indians make

clear that there were signifcant racial barriers to access and advance-

ment within engineering. British officials and engineers found creative
ways to discredit Indians and prevent their entry and advancement
within the engineering profession. It is also the case that caste and religion were tropes deployed by British officials to disqualify Indians

whom they perceived as being unable to transcend their social affiliations to embody the supposed integrity and impartiality of colonial
officialdom. All sorts of contradictory rationales— practicality on the

one hand, gentlemanliness on the other— served to justify a sense of

En glish progressivism and competence while maintaining a racial glass

ceiling in the colonial ser vices.

Still, throughout the early twentieth century, upper- caste Indians

did enter engineering in increasing numbers. As previously mentioned,
the British were keen to meet the need for technical expertise without

rocking the boat socially. This was the reason for withdrawing the
Stanley engineers, whose lower- class backgrounds were seen as socially

destabilizing. It was also why upper castes were identifed as best

suited— socially, if not technically—to the engineering profession. It

is in their approach to Indian students that we most clearly see British
accommodation of upper- caste “feelings and prejudices” and the need

to preserve existing forms of social distinction.

By all accounts, Indian upper castes did eschew programs such as

the vocational and industrial schools set up by Eu ro pean missionaries

and government officials, a tendency that Eu ro pean observers attrib-

uted to “a much older tradition of Brahmin intellectualism.” [36] On the
other hand, as noted by S. F. Downing, the frst principal of Sibpur College of Engineering, upper- caste inhibitions about technical labor fell

away once such work was associated with high- status institutions:

I have learnt from conversation with respectable educated natives
that the fact of the department belonging to the Presidency College
gives it a certain status in the eyes of native society; consequently a
superior class is attracted to it than would be the case were a school

attached to large Government workshops in which the students
would have to work daily, such manual labor being, unfortunately,

considered derogatory by upper class Bengalis. This appears to me to
be an impor tant point, because native Assistant Engineers, Public

Works Department, have to associate officially with En glish gen-

tlemen, and consequently the former ought, if pos si ble, to be recruited

from the upper middle class community. [37]

Downing’s statement betrays the consistent effort on the part of the
British to attribute the elite character of colonial engineering to indigenous cultural barriers while at the same time doing their part to ac-

commodate and reinforce these “unfortunate” prejudices. As a result,

by the early twentieth century, public works had become a gentlemanly

affair conducted between white and brown elites.

Even a cursory look at the membership rolls of the two main pro-

fessional engineering bodies in the British Empire— the Institute of

Civil Engineers and the Institute of Mechanical Engineers— reveals

that the few Indian members were all upper caste and mostly Brahmin.

This was equally the case with the Institution of Engineers (India),
which was set up in Calcutta in 1920 as the Indian counterpart to the
professional bodies in London. Although some of its frst presidents
were Eu ro pean, most thereafter were Brahmin members of the Madras

and Bengal Public Works and Railways departments.

Official testimonies to the Indian Industrial Commission of 1916–

1918 show that Indians made the choice to enter engineering education with full regard for existing social distinctions. Arguments made
by both British and Indian witnesses refect two key concerns: that
technical work was socially devalued, and that the way to enhance the
value of the technical was to connect it to upper castes. At times, we


-----

44 THE CASTE OF MERIT

see the role of caste in comparisons drawn between engineering colleges. In his testimony, B. Heaton, successor to Downing as principal
of the Sibpur College of Engineering, contrasted Sibpur’s difficulties
with recruiting upper- caste students with the relative ease experienced

by the College of Civil Engineering at Roorkee. The prob lem, as he di-

agnosed it, was with the structure of Sibpur, which provided three
tiers of training: one for officers; one for supervisors; and one for carpenters, blacksmiths, and tinsmiths from affiliated technical schools.
Heaton observed that the fact of such social heterogeneity “would make
gentlemen who are cap i tal ists . . . chary of sending their sons to the col-

lege.” [38] Besides, he could not “give them the kind of accommodation
they are accustomed to at home.” Commensality came in for special
comment. Heaton contrasted the situation at Sibpur with that at
Roorkee, “where the students live entirely separate lives . . . were ex-

pected to live in a good style, to dress for dinner. My students have a
joint mess with sub- overseers and overseers.” The institutional prac-

tice of co- dining across social divides was inimical to the effort to re-

cruit Indian upper castes, who opted instead for institutions where
caste practices of purity and pollution were maintained. Not only did

maintaining status through practices of distinction vary across colleges, but their gradu ates were also treated differently. Heaton ob-

served that every person who graduated from Roorkee was guaranteed

39
a job at the level of an assistant engineer, “while only one of my thirteen students was assured a guaranteed post.” Alfred Chatterton of
the Madras College of Civil Engineering commiserated with Heaton
but suggested that the prob lem lay with the university as the sole path

to high- status government employment. The “PWD State,” he opined,

had created a structure of expectations where a university degree in
law and humanities was a passport to a job in the revenue ser vice. [40]

This assumption prejudiced upper castes in favor of the university over

the engineering college.

The solution put forward by Chatterton and Heaton was to elevate

the status of engineering to make it attractive to Indian elites. They
proposed several routes to achieving this outcome. First, the state could
establish an autonomous technological institution modeled on the
Osborne Naval College in England. This would require “cutting off

the lower classes,” recruiting from the early age of fourteen, wooing

potential technical students away from the university while still providing them with ele ments of a liberal education, and assuring em-

ployment up to the executive engineers’ grade. [41] Second, they suggested
the establishment of an imperial college of engineering as an umbrella
encompassing all the branches of engineering or, as a compromise option, the federation of the four existing colleges of engineering. The
creation of a pan- Indian body would enhance the status of engineering

by linking it more defnitively with the imperial rather than the regional scale of government.

While upper- caste Indians and British policy makers were preoccu-

pied with enhancing the status of engineering by severing it from
other forms of technical training, others argued against this move. One

question posed by the Indian Industrial Commission was whether

technical schools should fall under the Department of Education or

under the Department of Industries. Hanumantha Rao, the head of the
economic nationalist Andhra Jateeya Kalasala, answered defnitively.
Manual work was already socially devalued, and locating technical
training under the Department of Industries would only diminish its

value further. Rao instead proposed that technical training as a whole

be actively promoted as both an educational and a cultural ideal. He
argued that to alter the cultural perception of technical skill required
that “the whole power of the educational ideal must be directed to

awaken in the popu lar mind an inclination and a passion for industrial

enterprise.” [42] This awakening would only happen by “introducing into
the scheme of general education in the country a course of manual
training such as would help to give early enough in life a bias towards

work involving skill and efficiency of muscular power.” [43] Only such a
far- reaching scheme would induce a wholesale shift in the value of

technical labor. In addition to rethinking hierarchies of value, Rao also

argued against an instrumental approach to learning, “for other wise

the Indian youth would instinctively turn away from training which
holds out not the ideal of culture, but of purely professional training.” [44]

Rao’s critique was leveled against both the denigration of the tech-

nical and its elevation solely through its link to professionalism. Rao
proposed a wholesale transformation in cultural worldview to recog-

nize the value of technical labor as a source of knowledge that should

be foundational to both education and nation- building. This was a far


-----

46 THE CASTE OF MERIT

more radical stance than the solutions proposed by Chatterton and
Heaton, who were principally concerned with making engineering

professionally attractive to upper castes.

Rao’s advocacy for a necessary cultural revolution in perception and

practice was partly echoed by attorney B. N. Basu, who offered this wry
observation:

I am told that when the frst Hindu student in the Calcutta Medical
College was induced to perform an operation upon a dead body, guns
were fred from Fort William in recognition of the fact that a Hindu
got over the prejudice of touching a dead body. . . . In the course of

twenty or thirty years we got a very fne class of Indian surgeons and
physicians, and so I do not see why if we fre a gun when the frst
Brahmin begins to make a shoe now we should not get in thirty years
quite as satisfactory results. [45]

Although Basu still saw the conversion to modernity of upper castes
as a necessary stepping- stone to advancing the cause of technical edu-

cation, he nonetheless shared Rao’s conviction that this had to involve
a broader transformation of cultural prejudices against embodied labor.

Despite the eloquence of their testimonies, Rao and Basu were un-

able to effectively challenge the widespread assumption that the only
way to elevate the technical was by disassociating it from lower- caste

technique and associating it with upper- caste knowledge. That tech-

nical education policy reinforced existing caste divisions is evident

in another set of testimonies given to the Indian Industrial Commission by manual workers in artisanal industries. Daivasikhamani
Achari, secretary of the Kumbakonam Visvakarma Mahajana Conference Committee, came before the commission to speak on behalf of
“the artisans of the South” and to express his concern that technical
education was marginalizing those very groups who came from histo-

ries of skilled manual labor. Although artisans were “the industrial

backbone of the country,” he attested, “they were not going to be the

benefciaries of the new policy regarding technical schools.” Achari
singled out the state technical scholarships that sponsored students to
go abroad for technical training as indicative of a larger prob lem: the

prerequisite of formal education barred most artisans from accessing
these scholarships. Rather than cultivate those who historically bore


-----

THE COLONIAL CAREER OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE 47

the weight of industry, “the mistake lay in the very frst steps taken,

viz., in the se lection of students to go to foreign countries for training,

from communities other than industrial or artisan classes who possess
the initial aptitude for manual labor, born of an inherited capacity and

instinctive professional skill which a University gradu ate of any other

class despised as a derogation of his caste dignity or literary merit.” [46]
To drive home his point about the injustice of favoring upper castes
at the expense of artisans, Achari cited the 1911 census report on “the
complete dissociation of the intellectual class in the country from its
industries. . . . Manual work of any kind was looked upon as degrading

and the higher castes treated with contempt the artisans and craftsmen
who carried on the industrial work of the country.” [47] Achari’s criticism
could not have been more pointed; still, his testimony met the same
fate as those of Rao and Basu.

It is evident from all these statements that technical education was

propagated in a context thick with assumptions about the value of labor

and expectations that existing social distinctions of caste not be blurred
with the advent of the new knowledge. British testimonies before the
Indian Industrial Commission addressed the need to expand the scope
of technical education by targeting upper- caste groups who, for social

and professional reasons, would have opted instead for the law or humanities. They were clear that the appeal of technical education could

not simply be assumed; in a context where the hierarchies of value
worked against the hands-on character of engineering, its status had
to be cultivated through active association with high- status groups. As

with Christian missionizing in the nineteenth century, an upper- caste

convert to the technical professions was highly prized.

Catering to upper castes did see results. While they did not go for

anything that smacked of manual labor, upper castes were more en-

thusiastic about entering professional engineering programs that promised social status and well- paying careers. Indeed, the stratifcation of

technical training was perfectly well suited to the upper- caste desire

to maintain social distinctions within native society while entering
new, modern felds of knowledge and bridging the racial gap in professional employment within the state. For their part, colonial officials
were happy to accommodate caste prejudices in order to enhance the
status and growth of engineering. In effect, upper- caste prejudice and


-----

48 THE CASTE OF MERIT

colonial policy dovetailed to consign those social groups with a history

of technical skill to the margins of the growing feld of engineering.

Industrial Schooling: Defning the Artisan

Marginalizing artisans did not mean that they were ignored. Just as

there was considerable ink spilled in determining the appropriate
bearing and orientation of the engineer, much was written about the
artisan’s place within a modernizing society. And just as there was

little consensus over whether the engineer was best taught on the shop-

foor or the classroom, the jury was out on how to deal with the threat
posed to the artisan by industrialization and free trade.

Artisanship occupied an ambivalent place within colonial and na-

tionalist imaginaries of India. There were those who believed in the

artisan’s inevitable obsolescence. This faith in the technological timeline was echoed by state officials such as the Punjab government’s
industrial expert, who predicted the “ultimate ruin of the native
tanner” and advised that it “is merely a question of time, and the Government can do nothing, nor is it in the public interest to do anything,
directly to save him. The only course to follow is . . . to offer every rea-

sonable encouragement to large tanners, and in par tic u lar to subsidize

a suitable factory.” [48]

In contrast, others saw the principal function of industrial policy

as the defense of artisanal traditions against the rise of factories. Those

who sought to rehabilitate the arts and crafts of India included Luddites like John Ruskin and William Morris and the principals of the
schools of art set up in the 1880s. For them, Indian artisanal traditions
represented the prelapsarian past, which could still be protected from
the predations of industrial capitalism.

Often, the defense of the artisan within colonial officialdom was a

way of discrediting the Swadeshi movement to boycott British goods,
revive indigenous products, and push for protected industrialization.
For colonial critics, Swadeshi was Indian in name but not in content.
Rather, it was the British colonial and not the Indian nationalist who
was the true patron of Indian traditions. As the principal of the Madras School of Art put it in 1910:


-----

THE COLONIAL CAREER OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE 49

It is doubtless the easier way for Indians to throw aside all their artistic traditions as obsolete, to accept blindly the teaching of Eu ro-

pean commercial experts, to multiply factories and join in the mad
scramble for markets which Eu rope calls civilization. . . . Will India

be freer, happier and wiser when, instead of lacs of village craftsmen,
every town has its “swadeshi” cotton mills . . . and . . . “swadeshi”

music halls and gin palaces . . . ? Nowhere in India— not even in the

direst time of famine and pestilence—is there such utter depravity,

such hopeless physical, moral and spiritual degradation as that which
exists in the great cities of Eu rope. [49]

Even those at the heights of colonial administration, like Viceroy

Curzon, expressed an ambivalence toward industrialization because of

its anticipated effect on Indian art and craft. For him, modern industry
could only be an impoverished form of Western mimicry in a country
whose authenticity lay in its hereditary traditions:

The expansion of [factory] industries would be valuable insofar as
they would give increased employment to an increasing number of
workmen and would therefore swell the number of those who are not

compelled to depend on agriculture. From this point of view the introduction of factories and mills is equally laudable. But then comes
the other or artistic point of view, which appeals, at any rate to me,
much more forcibly. I would sooner attempt to revive the rapidly perishing art industries of India, perishing not because a market is not

forthcoming for them, but because the already existing market is

being lost by shortsighted parsimony and by the indulgence in vulgar
and semi- Europeanized designs. [50]

These critics of Swadeshi insisted that only colonial rule could be a
bulwark against the ills of modern industrial society. For them, India’s
artisanal traditions represented forms of indigenous “art and craft” antithetical to modernization. But like their opponents who favored
rapid industrialization, they were unable to envision an approach to

technological change with artisanship at its center. Rather, artisans
were survivals of another age that needed to be cherished and protected
against the inexorable force of industrial modernity.

There were others, however, who argued for the signifcance of ar-

tisanship, not to a vanis hing past but for an alternate future. Alfred


-----

50 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Chatterton, who became famous for his “pioneering factories” to make
artisanship commercially viable, was one such person. But even Chat-

terton opposed the Swadeshi call for protectionism, which he saw as
being driven primarily by po liti cal rather than economic consider-

ations. “In lieu of protective duties,” he argued, “I am strongly in favor

of an energetic educational and industrial policy having for its object
the fostering of industrial enterprise and the diversion of a fair proportion of the intellect of the country from non- productive to directly pro-

ductive occupations.” [51] Chatterton approached indigenous industrial
development largely as a technical endeavor. Although he appreciated
the role played by the Swadeshi movement in highlighting the destruction of indigenous industry under foreign competition, he disparaged

the impulse to attribute to such issues “a po liti cal character.” He

thought politics an unnecessary distraction from the real business of
growing and innovating with local industries.

In the end, and despite differences in emphasis, such arguments in

favor of indigenous industry fed the broader opposition to the rising
tide of economic nationalism. For all these advocates, regardless of

whether they believed in preserving or developing artisanship, the artisan had to be a ward of the colonial state, because Indians were not

equipped with the aesthetic or technical skills necessary to properly
induct an artisan into the modern world.

_Education “Destined for Industrial and Commercial Pursuits”_

Chatterton was among those concerned with the side of technical ed-

ucation dealing with groups “destined for industrial and commercial
pursuits.” This was training intended not for the disgruntled “Babu or
anglicized Brahmin” facing unemployment after a degree in law or

medicine, but for youth from families specializing in handicraft and
other traditions of manual labor. In contrast to the civil engineer’s mix

of mental acuity and practical know- how, students of industrial schools

were expected to be primarily practically oriented.

At the same time, what a practical education should consist of and

toward what end remained ill- defned despite ongoing debate from the

1880s to the 1930s. In 1883, the Hunter Education Commission underscored the “real need in India for some corresponding course which
shall ft boys for industrial or commercial pursuits.” In 1884, the Gov-

THE COLONIAL CAREER OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE 51

ernment of India followed with a resolution to implement the commission’s recommended bifurcation of high school education into two
divisions: one intended to lead to the entrance examination of the universities, and the other, of a more practical character, designed to “direct the attention of native youth to industrial and commercial pursuits.” Despite these pronouncements, nothing much was done by way

of implementation. In 1886, when Home Secretary A. P. MacDonnell
examined the conditions of industrial schooling in the vari ous prov-

inces, he noted with dismay that only the Madras Presidency under

Chatterton had taken steps to implement the 1884 order. [52]

Another resolution followed in 1888, which distinguished two kinds

of technical training corresponding to dif fer ent levels of industry. First,

there was technical education “of a preliminary character including
the study of natu ral science and the cultivation of the faculty of ob-

serving and reasoning from experiment.” Second was technical training
“proper,” which was “the preparation of a man to take part in producing
effectively some special article of commercial demand.” The latter was
identifed as “an auxiliary of manufacture and industrial capital” and,
as such, was to be promoted at the centers of industrial development.
The government proposed that local administrations conduct a survey
of impor tant local industries in collaboration with a committee of ed-

53
ucational experts and professional men. This would ensure the coordinated development of industrial and educational policy.

The mantra of “industrial and commercial pursuits” signaled a dif-

fer ent orientation for industrial schooling. Unlike engineering, which

led gradu ates to professional careers in the civil ser vices, industrial

schooling was tied to industrialization. This opened it up to a dif fer ent

set of debates. Most importantly, as an “auxiliary of manufacture and
industrial capital,” industrial schooling was drawn into the battle be-

tween free marketers and state interventionists over the proper path

to industrialization in India.

To advance industrial schooling, the government requested Sir Ed-

ward Buck in 1901 to submit a report on the position and pro gress of

practical education in each province. Buck’s chart of the dif fer ent types

of primary and technical schools indicated the prevalence of industrial
schools following the model established by Christian missionaries in
their promotion of native industry. Typically, such schools offered


-----

52 THE CASTE OF MERIT

literary education alongside the teaching of minor trades, particularly
carpentry and smithy work, with the sale of articles made in the school
contributing to its maintenance. Buck offered the following criticisms
of the existing paradigm: general and technical education were com-

bined to the disser vice of both, instruction was not adequately differen-

tiated for dif fer ent classes, there was disproportionate attention given

to carpentry and smithy work, trades that were taught were not pur-

sued, and attempts at working for a market ended in failure. [54]

The government had a mixed response to Buck’s report. Some of-

fcials agreed that instruction should be differentiated for dif fer ent

classes. Others argued for the need to break the caste domination of

par tic u lar trades by following the example set by missionaries in pro-

viding opportunities for Christian converts to learn trades that were

socially closed to them. There was also disagreement over Buck’s rec-

ommendation to distinguish general and technical education because

general education was “so little advanced among the population at large

and more especially among the classes and castes who were likely to

adopt an industrial life.” [55]

In 1904, the government passed a resolution echoing the 1883

Hunter Commission report. It noted the “too literary” character of secondary schools and called for alternative courses to meet the needs of
“boys destined for industrial or commercial pursuits.” While the government did not expect a sudden increase in the existing number of
industrial schools—123 schools, with 8,405 pupils and 48 dif fer ent

trades—it did underscore the need to “confne their institutions to boys
belonging to the specialized caste or occupational groups who were

likely to practice the crafts taught in the schools.” [56]

Official documents show that caste defned both the past and the

future of students in industrial schools. Just as engineering education
was targeted at upper castes with par tic u lar family and educational

profles, so, too, was industrial schooling channeled toward lower

castes from families with very dif fer ent occupational histories. There

was some acknowl edgment that those “destined” for industrial labor

should still receive a general education, and that missionary attempts
to break caste barriers were impor tant. Nevertheless, the stratifcation

of technical education did ultimately reproduce caste differences.


-----

THE COLONIAL CAREER OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE 53

As with engineering education, those advocating industrial

schooling instrumentalized caste in policy. We see this, for instance,
in testimony given before the Industrial Commission by W. W. Hornell, the director of public instruction. It was difficult to recruit students to industrial schools, he explained, because “no scholarship can

compensate the boy or his parent for the loss of wages.” Speculating
about alternative ave nues to recruitment, Hornell wondered whether

caste groups could serve as functional equivalents of trade unions.

“Had caste been adopted as an educational unit in the frst instance

the result might have been dif fer ent,” he suggested. “It is in many ways

a valuable social organ ization of which use might have been made.”

Even while insisting that caste was un- British and unnatural and that

“ there never was a possibility of a constructive attitude toward it,” Hor-

nell regretted that “a demo cratic outlook in sociology has emphasized

its worst features.” [57]

Despite the disavowal and disparaging of caste as antithetical to

British culture and universal morality, its structuring role in administrative sociology and practice persisted. As we have already seen, the
combined discursive disavowal and practical use of caste was most
often justifed with reference to native sentiment. At the same time,
colonial technical education only reinforced caste differences by
tracking social groups into their “destined” occupational niches.

_Advocating State Intervention_

In the 1910s, the recurring debate over whether industrial schooling

was primarily an educational or an industrial endeavor began to shift
more decisively toward the latter because of a new focus on industri-

alization. In their 1911 report, Atkinson and Dawson underwrote this
re orientation. As pointed out by K. T. B. Tressler, Madras Presidency’s

superintendent of industrial education, Atkinson and Dawson’s investigation was essentially an inquiry into what was needed to produce a
class of workers for modern industry. Tressler also added his own
opinion that however excellent industrial schooling was in imparting
the princi ples of vari ous trades, gradu ates still needed to be employed.

As far as he was concerned, the real solution to both the elusive purpose of industrial schooling and the impediments to industrialization


-----

54 THE CASTE OF MERIT

was the more effective integration of the employers of labor into both

pro cesses. [58]

Even with the policy shift toward industrialization, it was not until

World War I that the question of how to push it forward was seriously
addressed. The war lent a new urgency to what was previously a desultory engagement with Indian industrial growth. It exposed India’s dependence on the import of essential commodities and the need to avert
future shortages in the supply of dyes, medicines, and other chemicals.
Moreover, it was now thought necessary for the state to aid private enterprise in ensuring that India was war ready. Fi nally, as detailed in

Chapter 2, the spread of anticolonial nationalism, particularly the accusation that Britain was “underdeveloping” India, forced the hand of
the colonial state. As a consequence, the Government of India resolved
to push harder for a new industrial policy.

The clearest expression of the new commitment to industrializa-

tion was the report of the Indian Industrial Commission. The report
represents what science studies scholar Shiv Visvanathan calls “the
translation of Swadeshism into the grammar of official technological
discourse.” [59] Put more simply, it is a sustained argument for state- led

industrialization. Foreign pre ce dent was impor tant here, particularly

the experiences of Germany and Japan. Debate over their economic
miracles, and the role of their states in industrialization, strengthened
the hands of the interventionists and put the advocates of laissez- faire

on the defensive.

In advancing state intervention, the example of Chatterton in

Madras became crucially impor tant. Chatterton frst arrived in India

to be a professor in the Madras College of Engineering, was subsequently
appointed superintendent of the Madras School of the Arts in 1897, and
f nally moved to work as the director of industries and commerce in the

princely state of Mysore. While working in Mysore, he was appointed
a member of the Indian Industrial Commission.

Visvanathan refers to Chatterton as an “ethno- technologist” whose

admiration for the history of technological innovation in India— for in-

stance, he remarked on the outstanding quality of Mughal canals and
Dravidian tanks— made him an anomaly in British officialdom. How-

ever, Chatterton was most controversial because of his “pioneer facto-

ries.” His experience with the decline of handicrafts and indigenous


-----

THE COLONIAL CAREER OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE 55

industry in Madras Presidency, as well as the underemployment of students from industrial schools, had led him to the conviction that more
needed to be done. Chatterton came up with the novel scheme of
starting pioneer factories run on commercial lines that would educate
the manufacturers of Madras about innovations in practice, jump- start

indigenous industry, and employ the gradu ates of industrial schools. [60]

The success of his factories, which were running at a proft by 1899,

led to the creation of the frst provincial Department of Industries in
1908 under his leadership.

Chatterton’s work created a furor over the proper role of government

in the economy. The business houses of Madras lobbied hard through

the Madras Chamber of Commerce against what they perceived as the
unfair participation of government in economic development. Eventually, laissez- faire opposition won out. In 1910, the secretary of state

abolished the Department of Industries, shifted Chatterton to the Education Department, and made him the superintendent of industrial
education. It was only after repeated protests by Indians in the Madras

Legislative Council that the Department of Industries was reinstated
in 1914.

Chatterton’s scheme also came in for strong criticism from England.

As one member of the Council of India put it, “I regard it as a waste of
money and wrong in princi ple. I don’t believe as a rule in attempts to

create industries . . . and the probabilities are that the lethargy of . . .

Madras . . . is due to causes beyond the reach of State effort.” [61] Even

more strongly worded was the rebuke of Sir James Mackay, representative of commerce on the India Council, who characterized Chatterton
as a man “who can have no business or practical experience of factories, [is on] a salary of £1,200 p.a. with a lot of highly paid assistants
to fool about with model childish factories which will never earn a

sixpence. . . . This is how money is frittered away in India.” [62] Despite

sustained opposition, Chatterton was given time to prove the success
of his intervention, which he managed to do. Nonetheless, the damage
was done, and the Government of India was instructed to abide by the
“natu ral laws” of the free market and limit its intervention to “indus-

trial instruction.”

Even among those advocating state- led economic change, there

were other, irresolvable differences. The proper scale of industry, the


-----

56 THE CASTE OF MERIT

proper economic sectors for state intervention, and the proper path of
development— all these were left open to debate. While some stood by

the protection and promotion of handicrafts and small- scale industry,

others pushed for large- scale industrialization along the lines of Ger-

many and Japan. Chatterton’s factories continued to draw positive and
negative attention as examples of what was right or wrong about state
intervention. The Governments of India and Madras remained loyal to
him, and his work occupied pride of place at the Simla Education Conference of 1900, when the provincial departments of industries were

being established between 1905 and 1912, and during the work of the
Indian Industrial Commission.

As a member of the Indian Industrial Commission, Chatterton had

a second shot at advancing his arguments for state- led industrializa-

tion and its alignment with industrial schooling. In its recommendations on education, the commission proposed that authority over industrial education should remain with provincial departments of
industries, with the government reserving the right to decide whether

par tic u lar schools should be controlled by the education or industries

department. The commission also proposed the constitution of an imperial department of industries as a centralized authority that would
rely on visiting experts to advise provincial governments on the conduct of industrial and technical education.

On paper, the Indian Industrial Commission report was a sea change

in colonial economic policy. However, its timing was off because it was

published around the same time as the Montagu- Chelmsford report on

constitutional reforms. While both reports emphasized the need for
rapid industrialization of the economy with active state participation,
they differed on the pro cess. The Indian Industrial Commission’s re-

port emphasized the need to centralize direction in the Government
of India. By contrast, the Montagu- Chelmsford Reforms Committee

promoted decentralization to the provincial level. Provincial autonomy
was accompanied by fnancial stringency, which was exacerbated in
the years after the Great Depression. This slowed industrial develop-

ment to a near standstill until the advent of in de pen dence. All of these

false starts to state- led industrialization undercut the possibility of em-

ploying those lower- caste students who were “destined for industrial

and commercial pursuits.” Industrial schooling was a dead end because

of the strident opposition to initiatives such as Chatterton’s, which
might have mitigated the deleterious effects of imperial trade.

�

On the whole, the two tracks of industrial schooling and college engi-

neering diverged but without signifcant developments to either. Re-

gardless, their respective association with industrial labor and the pro-

fessions was clinched. As we will see in Chapter 2, the transition to

in de pen dence and an emerging consensus in favor of industrialization

only reinforced the government’s commitment to the two tracks. For
in de pen dent India’s engineers, the association with state developmen-

talism enhanced their status as nation- builders, while those trained to

populate the industrial workplace assumed their structural position on
the lower rungs of an industrializing society. While engineers in general benefted from their link to the developmental state, their institutional location mattered. We will now turn to the founding of the IITs

as the uppermost tier of postcolonial technical education and look more
fully into their role in consolidating the caste basis of professional
engineering.

#### Building the IITs

S ecretary of S tate Hamilton’s critique of India’s ingrate Babus and
Brahmins highlighted the broader context in which debates over the
scale, scope, and object of colonial technical education were unfolding.

As we saw in Chapter 1, the push for a more scientifc approach to education emerged as early as the 1830s in elite Indian circles. While initially geared toward professional employment in government ser vices,

the demand for technical education was eventually brought within the
framework of anticolonial nationalism. By the 1930s, nationalists
linked technical education to the emerging consensus around the need
for an in de pen dent state, which would be the prime engine of economic

growth.

How did the push for po liti cal in de pen dence shape the trajectory

of technical education? This chapter explores the place of technical
education within Indian nationalism and early postin de pen dence

nation- building. We will look in par tic u lar at the rationale behind the

founding of the IITs and arguments for and against this tier of engineering education. Why was it thought necessary to add a new set of
institutions to the existing ones? And how did India’s statesmen envision the place of the IITs within an existing social and institutional
landscape?

Beginning in the late nineteenth century, a series of nationalist

writings underscored the link between technical education and the

58

BUILDING THE IITS 59

need for self- governance. In the 1880s, the _Mahratta,_ the newspaper

started by nationalist and social reformer Bal Gangadhar Tilak, focused
its attentions on the demand for technical education and the associated need to look beyond Britain to the United States and Germany for
inspiration and instruction. In 1886, geologist P. N. Bose’s pamphlet
_Technical and Scientifc Education in Bengal_ decried the lack of
training within British India for industrial development. In 1887, the

1
Indian National Congress passed a resolution demanding that the government “be moved to elaborate a system of technical education.”
The “imperative need for technical education” was echoed in subsequent years by a number of prominent nationalists: W. C. Banerjee in
1892, Anandamohan Bose in 1898, N. G. Chandarvarkar in 1900, and
Madan Mohan Malaviya in 1909. Over this period, the demand was
also picked up by other Indian newspapers. By 1918, when the Indian
Industrial Commission wrapped up its work, the demand for technical
education had been coupled with concerns over repre sen ta tion. Srini-

vasa Sastri, a member of the Imperial Legislative Council, called for a
democ ratization of expertise by reserving the technical and scientifc

ser vices for Indians. [2]

While anticolonial critiques of underdevelopment arose in the

1860s, it was only in the aftermath of World War I that they were tied

to the prospect of industrial development under a sovereign nation-

state. This was also a moment for infuencing policy. The hegemony
of laissez- faire had weakened, and there was more room for alternatives

both within and beyond imperial administration. The broader institutional context had also changed with the proliferation of formal economic associations, such as local chambers of commerce, trade associations, and industrialist groups. And beginning in 1905, the annual
Indian Industrial Conference— held in the same town and time frame

as the meetings of the Indian National Congress— provided a national

platform. Nationalist opinion echoed in the conferences at Naini Tal,
Ootacamund, Dacca, and Lahore. Provincial governments or ga nized

their own campaigns to lobby the India Office for a new, interventionist
industrial policy and to get support for new departments of industries.
Legislative councils passed resolutions in favor of intervention, govern-

ment presses put out official publications lauding existing industrial
departments, and efforts were made to win over business leaders. [3]


-----

60 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Alongside pressuring the colonial government to grow technical

education, nationalists began their own initiatives. In 1904, they formed
an association in Calcutta for the advancement of Indian scientifc
and technical education, which supported the studies of Indian students
in Japan, the United States, and Eu rope. In 1905, Indian industrialists

and the Indian National Congress sponsored an industrial conference
in Banaras, where a recommendation to establish a national polytechnic institution and at least one technical college in each province
was forwarded to the government. When no response was forthcoming,
conference leaders founded a college of engineering and technology at
Jadavpur, Calcutta, in 1907. [4]

Although the politics of Indian engineers varied, the rise of eco-

nomic nationalism shaped even the perspectives of those operating

within colonial state institutions. They began to echo the argument
that industrialization was a necessary cornerstone not of a colonial
India but of a self- reliant one. Even those who held prominent positions

within the colonial engineering establishment— such as C. V. Krish-

nasawami Chetty, chairman of the South India Centre of the Institution of Engineers, and M. Visvesvaraya, the most infuential and celebrated south Indian engineer— began to re orient themselves around the

prospect of national in de pen dence. Chetty argued that World War I had

made Indians aware “of their utter dependence on other countries for
most of their daily wants” and of “the urgent necessity for starting
vari ous industries.” The Institute of Engineers, he declared, must offer

its support to the National Planning Committee: “Our Institution
must place at the disposal of the National Planning Committee all the
technical assistance it can give. Our Institution must play an important part in the industrialization of the country. . . . Time has come for

engineers to evince greater interest and take part in the po liti cal life

of the country.” [5]

Visvesvaraya’s memoirs are even more illuminating. His profes-

sional tenure was remarkable for the sheer diversity of positions he
held and the range of places he worked. Visvesvaraya was deputed to
work on proj ect sites as far- fung as Bombay, Hyderabad, Mysore, and

Aden. He received his engineering degree in 1883 from the Poona College of Engineering, which was affiliated with Bombay University. As


-----

BUILDING THE IITS 61

the university’s top engineering student, he was appointed to the
Bombay Public Works Department as assistant engineer. Unlike many
who faced racial hurdles to entry and advancement, he was remarkably
successful in securing coveted positions in the engineering ser vice.

Moreover, his move from the colonial ser vice to the ser vice of the

princely state of Mysore gave him an in ter est ing comparative perspec-

tive on the relationship between engineering, state, and society under

conditions of direct versus indirect rule.

In his memoirs, Visvesvaraya narrates his identity as a technical

man, as an intermediary between state and society, and as a member
of a modernizing high caste destined to lead. Much of the narrative
consists of extended accounts of his work on proj ects and his ingenuity

in the face of technical challenges. There are also several instances

where he recounts his handling of social protest in the face of proj ect

implementation. It is in his leveraging of social hierarchies to meet his
desired goals that we see most clearly his self- appointed role as an ex-

pert intermediary between state and society as well as his unshakable
faith in reason and procedure in the face of social opposition. He was
convinced that the right information delivered in the right manner
would necessarily produce consent. Rarely did Visvesvaraya betray
doubts about the necessity or virtue of his expert knowledge or its
ability to transform the world. Even in his support for nationalism, Visvesvaraya expressed an understanding of the engineer as a bearer of

universal knowledge whose contribution to nationalism was primarily
technical. Engineers were not the rabble- rousers of anticolonial nation-

alism or the statesmen of postcolonial politics. As he saw it, they were

frst and foremost technical men whose mastery of mechanical systems
equipped them to engineer society. [6]

Visvesvaraya’s affiliation with social elites and his sense of him-

self as an enlightened Indian destined to lead comes through palpably
in his descriptions of his social world. Here we see his identifcation

not just as a professional state engineer who prized efficiency and procedure but as part of a set of modernizing high castes. His memoir lists
a number of prominent nationalists as close friends, including M. G.
Ranade and G. K. Gokhale, whom he described as “guides of the enlightened public of Poona and Maharashtra” and as liberals and moderates


-----

62 THE CASTE OF MERIT

who had one foot in government and one in politics. Unlike leaders
such as B. G. Tilak, who, as Visvesvaraya saw it, “took up an uncompromising attitude in criticizing British policies and methods of administration,” Visvesvaraya’s inner circle consisted of those who understood

how to straddle the two worlds. They were also Hindu reformers who

increasingly saw themselves as distinct from their more orthodox caste
fellows. Visvesvaraya aligned himself with these liberal proponents of

Hindu reform and kept at a distance from both po liti cal “radicals” and

the Brahmin orthodoxy of Poona, whom he saw as intransigent in their
attitudes. History, as he understood it, was on the side of pro gress,

which increasingly pointed in a liberal nationalist direction.

The welling up of nationalist sentiment even among the colonial

administration’s most celebrated successes demanded a response. As
we saw in Chapter 1, some members of the Government of India pushed
for a new industrial policy as “a great sedative of po liti cal unrest.”

Others, however, argued the opposite. Even those who actively advo-

cated for industrialization were concerned that it would generate new

tensions. T. H. Holland, the president of the Indian Industrial Commission, warned that “neither the cap i tal ists nor the educated em-

ployees will thereby become more contented and loyal; on the con-

trary, they will soon forget that the industrial impetus came from

Government; they will imagine that the prosperity is due to themselves

entirely, and that therefore they are capable of managing their own affairs.” Another commission member agreed by pointing to Rus sia,

which, he argued, “has shown that industrial development with the
consequent assemblage of bodies of workers in factories, tends to promote po liti cal agitation, agitators and seditionists taking the opportu-

nity of exploiting the workers’ . . . grievances for po liti cal ends.” [7]

Despite such differences of opinion, the new industrial policy did

move forward as a program of state aid to industry without protectionism. But as we saw earlier, it was stymied by the Depression and

by the decentralization of power to the provinces. It was only with the
postcolonial transition that the state commitment to industrialization
became a real ity. So, too, did public investment in engineering educa-

tion become a linchpin of technologically driven development.

The Comparative Methodology of Indian Economic Nationalism

One repeated strategy in Indian nationalist arguments for industrialization was the use of the comparative method to gauge the value of
Britain as a model. And time and again, Britain came up short. Sometimes such comparative analyses were used to debate the appropriate

relationship between science and technology in India. One point of
contention was whether the Indian Association for the Cultivation of

Science should be for science alone or also for technical education and
entrepreneurship. On one side was Bengali doctor and social reformer
Mahender Lal Sircar, who argued for the priority of science over technology by comparing Britain and Germany. Sircar maintained that it
was the enthusiasm of Germany’s wealthy classes for science and the
anti- science spirit of the British that allowed Germany to leapfrog over

England in the development of industry. On the other side was the Indian League, which insisted on privileging technical education and
vigorous entrepreneurship to stem the growing unemployment among
university gradu ates. The league also used Germany as an example and

proposed the establishment of a series of technical schools modeled on
the German _Technischen Hochschulen._ [8]

At other times, comparisons were used to advance an argument for

the intimacy between state and school. Indian National Congress president Madan Mohan Malaviya’s dissenting note on the Indian Industrial
Commission report is an example of how a comparative methodology
ended up elevating the school as the primary pedagogical instrument
of the industrializing state. Malaviya argued that the British factory
was an instrument not of industrialization but of deindustrialization.
British factories were about domination and coercion. If India was to

industrialize, it would have to look for other models, such as those of

Germany and France, where industry had moved from domination to
discipline, and where the school rather than the factory was the paradigmatic orga nizational entity. [9]

Malaviya pointed to the industrial exhibitions of the 1850s to make

the case for the centrality of schooling to industrialism. At the frst
exhibition in London in 1851, he argued, the Germans realized their inferiority in industry to England. In response, they established a network


-----

64 THE CASTE OF MERIT

of schools in every major town and center of industry to create an in-

dustrial cadre extending from professionals to workers. By the fourth
industrial exhibition in Paris in 1857, even England’s own inquiry

commission concluded that “the En glish workman is gradually losing

the race, through the superior intelligence which the foreign governments are carefully developing in their artisans.” Malaviya insisted
that “the education of Germany is the result of national organ ization

which compels every peasant to send his children to school, and af-

terwards affords the opportunity of acquiring such technical skill as

10
may be useful in the department of industry to which they are destined.” Britain’s defeat in these surrogate wars between imperial

powers, he concluded, had effectively dismantled the myth that its
command of coal and industrial skill rendered it superior to the
“unironed, uncoaled and unengineered nations of the world.” [11]

Other Swadeshi nationalists, including attorney B. N. Basu, also ar-

gued for the irrelevance of Britain as a model of industrial education.
The inadequacies of Indian colonial education, Basu suggested, were

nothing but a refection of outmoded metropolitan theories. Since the
idea of a formal applied science was new to England, and Oxford and

Cambridge had “not got over the feeling that humanistic studies should
predominate in the Universities,” one could hardly expect anything
dif fer ent in India. [12] In the place of Britain, Basu and Malaviya proposed

Germany and Japan— the “Asian Germany”—as appropriate models for

a modern industrial society based on applied science.

From Nationalism to the Technocratic State

The Indian Industrial Commission was a staging ground for the debate
between commission members, other colonial officials, and nationalists over the vari ous models of industrial society. For some colonial of-

fcers, it was occasion to reiterate the conviction that Indian technological incompetence was a refection of cultural backwardness or
moral temper and the necessity of British tutelage. For nationalists, it
was an opportunity to challenge Britain’s claim to a mono poly over

industrial expertise as a justifcation of rule. By pointing to other
models, both Western and Eastern, they rejected British tutelage and


-----

BUILDING THE IITS 65

claimed the right to in de pen dent interactions and collaborations out-

side the imperial fold.

But these nationalist arguments were not just about the illegitimacy

and constraints of colonialism. They also articulated a par tic u lar vi-

sion of the modern industrial state and of the role of the school within
it. Shiv Visvanathan points to Malaviya’s note on the Indian Industrial
Commission report as the clearest articulation of this argument for a
technocratic, pedagogical state. I quote him here at length:

Malaviya’s note has been embedded for too long in the archival
monuments of nationalism. . . . At one level he is the nationalist ar-

guing against colonial duplicity. But in the submerged archeology
of the modern industrial state, the Pandit outclasses Holland as the
technocrat. . . . Implicit in the structure of the . . . text are three

arguments which Malaviya elicits and elaborates. First, modern
technology necessitates as a discipline a new linking of knowledge
and power. It is the logic of this technology which eventually reconstitutes in a new fashion the state and the school. Both exist in order
to ensure an economy in the reproduction of industrial norms. The
intersection of knowledge and power is further embodied in the
isomorphy between the pedagogic state and the compulsory school.
The link between knowledge and power is also revealed in the special status given to the notion of intelligence. It is no longer regarded
as hereditary but as an input to be fed in by the agency of the state.
Intelligence becomes industrialized, standardized and productivity-
linked in the new notion of personnel. It is the state which assumes
responsibility for it through the school. [13]

This connection between state, industry, and school captured in

Malaviya’s advocacy was never fully realized under colonial rule. Even

while engineering was developed under the auspices of the colonial

state, it grew in fts and starts for the reasons detailed earlier. Only

after the transition to self- rule did the “isomorphy” between state and

school become an integral aspect of a planned economy and a nationalized citizenry. One can see the link between schooling and industrialization in the postin de pen dence expansion of engineering education

and the many programmatic statements about the centrality of engineering to nation- building.


-----

66 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Still, there was a disconnect between the purported goal of indus-

trialization and the vision of education advanced by the postcolonial
state. Unlike in Germany, where technical schools were more clearly

tied to industrial development and valorized on these grounds, the In-

dian investment in maintaining a distinction between the mental and

the manual undercut this possibility. Moreover, the upper echelons of
engineering education soon became delinked from the state development proj ect altogether and repurposed for private sector growth in

India and beyond. As we will see, the privatization and transnational-

ization of professional engineering transformed the relationship between state and economy and gave “nation- building” a very dif fer ent

meaning. Fi nally, the reconstitution of intelligence from a hereditary

quality into a state “input” was never complete. Even as technical expertise was more decisively yoked to state developmentalism, there

were clear continuities in assumptions about the innate and inherited
capacities of par tic u lar castes. In all these ways, Malaviya’s vision of

an all- encompassing state with its ideological apparatuses was only a

partial premonition. The postin de pen dence Indian state was certainly

both interventionist and transformative. But as we will see, it was also

profoundly shaped by older hierarchies of skills and persons.

The Sarkar Committee Report

On the eve of in de pen dence in 1945, the Government of India appointed

a committee under N. R. Sarkar to review the state of technical edu-

cation in India in anticipation of the need for personnel to assist with
postin de pen dence industrial development. In 1948, the committee sub-

mitted an interim report that underscored “the extreme urgency of
the situation.” The report pointed out that self- sufficiency was the need

of the hour because “the calls of reconstruction in Eu rope and else-

where, and the enormous industrial and Government undertaking
contemplated in Eu rope and Amer i ca to provide full employment, will

make it difficult, if not impossible, to secure from abroad, the ser vices

of the right type of engineers, architects, technologists and planners,
etc. to carry out India’s post- war proj ects.” Therefore, “a programme

of higher technical education and research in India should . . . be

pushed forward with utmost speed and determination.” [14]


-----

BUILDING THE IITS 67

The committee argued for the need to establish new institutions

that would “integrate mathe matics, science, and humanities with the

specialized professional subjects.” This, it was felt, would distinguish
them from existing engineering colleges, whose purpose “was limited

to supplying recruits to government departments responsible for the
maintenance of civil works located in the provinces.” By contrast, the
new institutions would educate engineers who were also well- rounded

scientists and would-be leaders in India’s technological development.

While the committee acknowledged that a more systematic survey

could better assess the “relation of each new institution to those which

already exist,” it contended that “the needs of the pre sent situation are

so apparent and urgent that a solution cannot be deferred pending such
a survey which would necessarily take a considerable time.” However,
it suggested that such a survey be conducted “before a fnal decision
was reached as to the organ ization and structures of Higher Technical

Education in the country as a whole.” [15]

The committee recommended the establishment of one higher

technical institution in each of the four regions of the country. This
distribution of institutions would “conform with the geo graph i cal po-

sition of industrial areas as well as with location of the great majority

of existing technical institutions and would be the most equitable and
effective in the interest of India as a whole.” While these higher tech-

nical institutions were to be centrally administered, the committee

emphasized the need to coordinate each institution’s teaching and research so as to be “of use to the region which it is designed to serve”
and “ after careful consideration of the contribution which can be made

by existing institutions (including Universities) in the region.” The
committee’s assessment of regional needs led to a proposed sequencing
of institutions, beginning with the east and followed by the west, the
north, and f nally the south. The committee envisioned each of these

regional institutions in “a large industrial Centre.” It was only by privileging larger centers for the new institutions, it felt, that the “right

16
relationship between the public, industry and education should be established and maintained.”

The committee received repre sen ta tions from both military and

civil authorities on how to increase the supply of trained engineers and,
in response, invited several of them to a discussion. [17] A key question


-----

68 THE CASTE OF MERIT

raised was about timing: Would the lag in turning out technical graduates from these new institutions retard industrial growth? And if so,

would not the needs of these industries be more immediately served

by institutions designed to cater to them? The other question was about
the ft between these proposed institutions and the needs of industri-

alization. Would these college gradu ates really have the requisite skills

to ser vice industry?

The lack of ft between the proposed institutions and industrial

development was addressed most extensively by Brigadier Woolfe,
comptroller general of inspection, and one of the committee’s external
invitees. In a letter to Dr. John Sargent, educational adviser to the
Government of India, Woolfe expressed his unhappiness with the committee’s approach. In par tic u lar, he doubted whether the proposed

institutions would fulfll their purported purpose of “ensur[ing] an
adequate supply of technical personnel for post war industrial development.” To illustrate his point, Woolfe provided a list of industries—
textiles, fbers, vegetable drugs, dyes and chemicals, lumber, detergents
and edible oils, coal tar, fuel, tanning, ceramics and glass, mining— and

noted that most of their needs would not be met by the kind of basic
undergraduate training to be offered. What was needed, he opined, was
far more specialized training “along the lines of the Manchester Institute
of Technology,” which catered to specifc industries and was ideally
conducted by them. What was not needed was “to food the market with
B.Sc.s whom no one will employ. Give me a Fuel technologist or a Dye

Chemist and I know what to do with him but difficulties arise at once
when I am asked to employ a B.Sc. with chemistry or physics as his
special subject.” As did his pre de ces sors a half century before, Woolfe

recycled concerns about the irrelevance of book learning to the practicalities of industry.

Despite concerns raised by Woolfe and others, the committee con-

cluded that “the probable demands of industries for High Grade Technical personnel (Executives, research workers, maintenance engineers,
and teachers) . . . have to be met through the proposed Higher Tech-

nical Institutions, while the demands for lower grade Technicians
could be met by the Ju nior Technical Institutions of the less advanced

type that would be linked to the Higher Technical Institutions.” [18] The
committee’s report makes clear that these new institutions were to be


-----

BUILDING THE IITS 69

set apart, not only from industrial schools for artisans and workers but
also from the regional engineering colleges established in the colonial
period to train an emerging professional class. This was a vision of further institutional stratifcation, with the higher technical institutions
occupying the topmost echelon. And even while they insisted on India
achieving self- sufficiency in technical expertise, foreign models con-

tinued to provide guidance. In par tic u lar, the committee identifed the

Mas sa chu setts Institute of Technology (MIT) as the most desirable

model, with its mix of practical and theoretical sciences, mathe matics,

and the humanities. [19] Like MIT, these institutions would have a dual

purpose: undergraduate instruction to produce technical gradu ates “for

post- war industrial and Governmental proj ects” and postgraduate study

and research “to produce research workers and technical teachers.”

The report proposed “a combination of a fundamental scientifc

training with a broad human outlook, which will afford the students

the type of collegiate education endorsed by leading engineers.” As the
authors saw it, this would be an ideal middle ground that avoided both

“the narrowness common among students in technical colleges” and
“the superfciality and lack of purpose noticeable in many of those

taking academic college courses.” [20] The imagined gradu ate would thus

be the perfect combination of mind and hand: a useful citizen, a qualifed engineer capable of exercising initiative and thought, and a professional enabled and motivated to apply engineering princi ples in prac-

tice. When it came to practical training, the report attempted to
address the debates of the past and fnd a compromise. The engineer,
it stated, “is not a craftsman nor is expected to possess the same degree of manual skill as an artisan.” Still, the authors expressed a strong

21
conviction that “he must have an intimate knowledge of workshop processes and methods.”
For this reason, facilities for instruction in elementary workshop pro cesses and methods were deemed essential to

academic instruction.

There appears to have been some disagreement on the terms of the

admissions pro cess. The report notes that “se lection for admission

should be made purely on merit and no provincial quotas should be allotted, but some proportion of the seats should be reserved for the educationally backward classes so that in due course the general level of
education throughout may be raised.” However, this recommendation


-----

70 THE CASTE OF MERIT

was footnoted with the following: “This is only a tentative view not
unanimously subscribed to by the members of the Committee and will

receive further consideration.” [22]

While the disagreement over admissions is not further explained,

what we do have is Nazir Ahmed’s dissenting note on the more elemental question of whether new institutions were at all necessary.

Ahmed objected strongly to the precipitous decision to recommend
wholly new institutions without adequately assessing whether the

country’s existing facilities could be further developed. Ahmed drew
on comparative instances to make his case: “In real planning for the
future, we must take into account the existing resources and must try
to build upon them. This pro cess has always been followed in Eu rope

and Amer i ca, where, whenever the need has arisen, the possibility of

developing the existing institutions has frst been explored before putting up new institutions.” He warned that if the Sarkar Committee
took its current course, “the existing institutions are likely to stagnate
and decay while the newer institutions will work in an atmosphere of

isolation.” Ahmed opined further that the benefts of establishing a few
new institutions “would be extremely limited leaving vast regions of

the country out of the scope of their utility.” Their necessarily uneven
impact “would be avoided if the existing institutions in the vari ous

provinces were developed and expanded so as to be within easy reach

of the people of all parts of India.” In the event that these new institu-

tions were founded, “quotas should be assigned to dif fer ent provinces

so that the inhabitants of all the provinces may be in a position to share
their benefts.” It was only “logical,” Ahmed concluded, that relying as
they would on public funds, “the people of the country as a whole should

have an equal share in the facilities provided in these institutions.” [23]

Ahmed’s arguments about the potential for institutional isolation,

limited impact, and undemo cratic limits to access went largely un-

heeded. The Sarkar Committee’s recommendations were imple-

mented after in de pen dence as part of the ruling Congress Party’s First

(1951–1956) and Second (1956–1961) Five Year Plans. The plans conceived
of a strong industrial base as a precondition for development. The
Second Five Year Plan in par tic u lar invested heavi ly in industry, dam

construction, metallurgy, and the railways, with expertise in civil and
mechanical engineering identifed as an urgent need. Beginning in the


-----

BUILDING THE IITS 71

1950s, the Indian government began to set up massive steel industries
with foreign collaboration. An added dimension of these partnerships

was the transfer of technical knowledge. The foreign partners had insisted that this transfer of know- how should occur within autonomous

technical institutions where freedom from the bureaucratic structure
of the existing university system would foster the spirit of research.
This was a perfect storm. Older forms of institutional stratifcation
based on hierarchies of skill and persons, the Sarkar Committee’s recommendations for the creation of a top echelon of technical education,
and the demand for autonomy as a condition of foreign support produced the IITs.

The Original Five

On the recommendations of the Sarkar Committee, the Indian government moved ahead with establishing a technological institute in each
of the four regions of the country. While the committee report provided
the basic template for the IITs, later committees refned its recommen-

dations. In 1950, the All India Council for Technical Education and
the Inter- University Board de cided that the IITs should grant bachelor

of technology degrees in four kinds of engineering: civil, mechanical,
electrical, and telecommunications. In their frst two years, all students
would take the same courses, and in their third and fourth years, they
would concentrate on their chosen feld. The committee also recommended that the institutes offer a master’s degree in each of the four
kinds of engineering. While these recommendations provided the

overarching structure for curricular development, the academic and
administrative autonomy granted to the institutes meant that they were

more able than most other Indian universities to try out new ideas.

The frst IIT was established in 1951 at Kharagpur, near Calcutta.

IIT Kharagpur received support from a variety of sources, including the
United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and UNESCO.
Following this, the Government of India arranged for each subsequent
IIT to receive most of its support from one international collaborator:
IIT Bombay was opened in 1958 through collaboration with the Soviet
Union, IIT Madras in 1959 with West Germany, and IIT Kanpur in 1960
with the United States. These were the four institutes envisioned by


-----

72 THE CASTE OF MERIT

the Sarkar Committee: Kanpur in the north, Madras in the south,
Kharagpur in the east, and Bombay in the west. A ffth followed in
Delhi due to the unexpected help of Great Britain, which contributed

£400,000 to transform Delhi University’s College of Engineering into
IIT Delhi in 1961. Altogether, the Soviet Union, West Germany, the
United States, and the United Kingdom supplied over $17 million worth
of equipment to the IITs and sent over 150 full- time visiting staff and

300 short- term con sul tants to India. In addition, more than 230 Indian

professors from the IITs received fellowships to study in sponsor nations. The technical assistance programs ended in the 1970s, but the
IITs continued to have strong ties with Western institutions.

Professor V. Indiresan, IIT Madras director from 1979 to 1984, opined

that the real contribution of the foreign partners “was in creating a
world- class academic ambience, in terms of the autonomy of the

teachers, the freedom to design your own courses, the credit system,
examination reforms, the tutorial system and so on.” [24] The IITs were

indeed founded on the premise of autonomy. In terms of governmental
oversight, this placed them wholly within the purview of the central
and not the regional state governments. Second, they fell outside the
structure of affiliation to universities, giving them greater say in institutional functioning, faculty hiring, and curricular development.
Third, their place outside regional education allowed the IITs to take
students from all over India through a centralized examination. As we
will see in Chapter 5, the examination would quickly become the central symbol of the autonomy, integrity, and excellence of the IIT system.

Democracy versus Excellence

The frst IIT at Kharagpur stands on the site of the former British prison
of Hijli. In the institute’s frst convocation address, Prime Minister
Jawaharlal Nehru spoke of the location’s symbolic value. “ Here in the

place of that Hijli detention camp stands this fne monument of India,”
he pointed out. “This picture seems to me symbolic of changes that
are coming to India.” Nehru went on to laud the engineer as the world’s
new nation- builder. “Now you are Engineers,” he proclaimed, “and this

world today . . . takes shape more and more under the hands of Engi-


-----

BUILDING THE IITS 73

neers.” For Nehru, it was appropriate that the engineer had superseded
the administrator as the primary agent of governance and development.
Administrators had always played an impor tant role, he admitted.

However, “the time has now come when the Engineer plays an infnitely greater role than anybody else.” In fact, he predicted, the divi-

sion between administrator and engineer would gradually fade away
“ because the major work of the country today deals with . . . engi-

neering schemes of vari ous types. We are building up a new India and

the administrator who is completely ignorant of engineering does not
help much in administering.” This was already true of more technologically developed countries, where “engineers and scientists play a
far more impor tant role even outside their sphere of engineering and

science.” Given the pre ce dent they had set, Nehru concluded, “that is

bound to happen in India.” [25]

Nehru’s pronouncement of engineering as the new technology of

nation- building heralded its importance in the proj ect of postin de pen-

dence developmentalism. The engineer was to be the linchpin of the
developmental state, with his technical feats putting the prowess of
the state on display. But Nehru did not bestow the same level of recognition and responsibility on all of in de pen dent India’s engineering col-

leges. His convocation address at the frst IIT indicated the exceptional
status of the IIT system. As benefciaries of bilateral relations with
the world’s industrial powers, the IITs were elevated as institutions

that would best realize the promise of technological development.

Institutional stratifcation was not limited to the feld of technical

education. In science too, a similar pro cess had produced the Indian

Institute of Science (IIS) as the most esteemed of scientifc institutions.
Both the IITs and the IIS were founded to distinguish effort from ex-

pertise. Indeed, this was quite explic itly stated in the government’s re-

view committee report on scientifc institutions, which defned scientifc expertise as the work of a “few men of high calibre” and emphasized
the constitutive link between excellence and selectivity. [26] The report
tied the success of the IIS directly to uneven investment. [27] The IIS’s
excellence “required the judicious investment of resources in ‘the development of fewer establishments for advanced training and research,’
since a more expansive approach would mean that ‘the general level of


-----

74 THE CASTE OF MERIT

technical education and research would be lowered.’ ” In other words,

demo cratizing access to training would be antithetical to excellence.

Nehru concurred. “I am all for democracy,” he opined, “but democracy
normally means mediocrity too. It is a well- known thing, you put up

with it in a democracy because, well, it is better to have democracy

than having something worse. But the fact is that numbers lead to
mediocrity.” [28]

Scientifc and technological expertise was thus set apart from “the

manpower mandate” through the development of a parallel institutional structure of higher education in techno- scientifc felds with

separate bud getary allocations, entrance examinations, fee structures,

and curricular frameworks. The exclusivity of institutions such as the
IITs and the IIS was ensured despite the dissenting opinions of a few
scientists, such as Nazir Ahmed and Meghnad Saha, “who argued for
a closer alignment between scientifc and technological research and
education and the existing network of national universities.” [29] Saha,
the son of a lower- caste shop keeper from East Bengal, was also an out-

lier when it came to the upper- caste social backgrounds of most prom-

inent scientists and technologists.

Exclusivity and excellence were to be maintained by insulating

such institutions from politics, commerce, and bureaucracy. Scientifc
and technological policy was formulated by Nehru’s handpicked group
of scientifc advisers without much parliamentary debate. This did not
mean that scientists and technologists were removed from the work of

government; indeed, they were intimately tied to it. As po liti cal scien-

tist Srirupa Roy puts it, “The inauguration of each laboratory was the
site as well as the means for the material repre sen ta tion of the science-

state- nation triad that structured social relations in Nehruvian India.

The joint presence of state officials and scientists at these events at-

tested to the partnership between science and the state.” [30] At the same
time, the repeated contrast between the creative labors of experts and

the unimaginative labors of bureaucrats sustained the idea of an au-

tonomous, insulated intellectual universe.

Signifcantly, caste ser viced these distinctions both as social real ity

and as meta phor. Although the Nehruvian government was officially

committed to democ ratization and against the use of caste in educa-

tion policy, insulating these institutions from the ferment of demo-

cratic politics ensured their role in the social reproduction of caste.
Furthermore, caste operated as a meta phor for merit. Nehru, for in-

stance, characterized nationally oriented science and technology as
infused with “the Brahminic spirit of ser vice.” This idea of the elite

scientist- technologist as Brahmin “conveyed both the ability of an elite

caste to disengage from the quotidian and material concerns that preoccupied those less privileged, and the unique qualities of creative

thought that emanated from the ‘head’ of the social body.” [31]

IITian Exceptionalism

The Indian state underwrote the exceptionalism of the IITs in many
ways. First, it did so through their founding as institutions distinct
from the existing educational ecosystem. Second, the patronage of foreign partners set them apart as “world- class” institutions that would

act as forerunners in developing India. The state indexed its intimate
association with this class of institutions through routine rituals of
recognition. The presence of prime ministers, presidents, ministers,
and foreign diplomats at IIT convocation ceremonies was commonplace, putting on visual display the institutes’ standing at the highest
echelon of Indian education. This did not go unnoticed by the institutions’ students. As one 1963 alumnus of IIT Madras put it, “Within a
couple of days of our joining, IITM held its frst convocation with President S. Radhakrishnan as the chief guest. For many of us, I think that
grand ceremony was a momentous introduction to the status of our
new home for the next fve years.” [32]

IITians have internalized this sense of status all too well. One re-

cent account of the IIT system is _The IITians,_ a 2004 book by alumnus-
journalist Sandipan Deb. Deb’s approach is historical and ethnographic. The book’s subtitle— _The Story of a Remarkable Indian_

_Institution and How Its Alumni Are Reshaping the World_ — makes

clear that it is also hagiographic. In this sense, it is a valuable primary
text for understanding the IITian worldview. Deb ends the book by recounting a conversation with Jairam Ramesh, another alumnus who
took the now unusual step of entering the civil ser vices and went on


-----

76 THE CASTE OF MERIT

to serve in dif fer ent capacities under vari ous Congress Party govern-

ments. Deb runs into Ramesh in the Delhi airport, where they are
catching the same fight to the IITs’ fftieth anniversary cele brations

in Bangalore. After hearing about the book, Ramesh asks, “Why don’t

you call it Midnight’s Brahmins? Because that’s what IITians are,

aren’t they? The frst educational institute was set up by India after

its tryst with destiny at midnight on 15 August 1947. And created
with the specifc purpose of creating a new elite, the new Brahmins,
except that they wouldn’t be reading the scriptures, they would be

technocrats.” [33]

The sense of exceptionalism expressed by Ramesh runs deep. He,

like Nehru, uses caste as a meta phor. At the same time, the self-

consciousness of being a breed apart—an intellectual elite— expresses

a pervasive form of caste sentiment. Deb’s book is peppered with examples of how IITians are “the Chosen Ones.” Exceptionalism is also
a recurring trope in the interviews I did with IITians from across the
generations. There are many ways IITians underscore their own

status. While a minority do so by explic itly invoking caste, most prefer

more demo cratic indices, such as merit and autonomy. As we will see

throughout this book, the tacking back and forth between caste and
non- caste markers of excellence signals a transformation in the lan-

guages of distinction, which nonetheless keeps in place older patterns
of differentiation.

However, there is also a perceptible shift between how earlier and

later IITians articulate their relationship to the state. For earlier gen-

erations, being an engineer meant a strong association with the state
and its developmental proj ects that was very much in continuity with

the late colonial period. Those inducted into the colonial engineering

ser vices experienced a new public identity fostered through association

with the state and with scientifc expertise. Through his training, the
professional engineer was brought within the framework of colonial
administration and bureaucracy and was predisposed to identify with
This was equally the case with the frst generations of IITians. the imperial state. [34]

By contrast, the link to the state has more recently become an in-

dication not of excellence but of its opposite. This shift even extends


-----

BUILDING THE IITS 77

to minimizing the role of Nehru, now demoted as a socialist, in favor

of other agents in the IIT origin story. Deb, for instance, argues that
rather than see the IITs as “Nehru’s dream,” they are most aptly characterized as “the brainchild of Sir Ardeshir Dalal, an aristocratic Parsi
technocrat of extraordinary dynamism.” [35]

The meaning of autonomy, too, has shifted from indicating an as-

sociation with the central government to conveying a general antipathy toward the state, this despite the IITs being among the most well-

funded public educational institutions in India. IITians routinely
disparage state actors as drags on the system by contrasting their own
institutes with other regional engineering colleges. A professor who
shifted from one such college to an IIT makes the comparison in Deb’s
book: “In the government engineering colleges, when they want to buy
an oscilloscope, they have to go through a tendering pro cess, get three

quotations and send them to some _babu_ in a government department.
By the time the _babu_ clears the fle and sends it back, the prices are no
longer valid, the technology has possibly changed, and they have to
start the whole cycle again.” [36]

For many, this disdain for regional engineering colleges extends to

Indian education more generally. Most IITians see their institutes as
islands of excellence in a sea of mediocrity. This sentiment is perfectly
captured by the statement of another alumnus in Deb’s book: “It’s like
the Calcutta Metro. It’s as if it’s something iconic. Every thing in the

city is crumbling. But the Bengali _bhadralok_ is proud of his Metro and
takes impeccable care of it, and keeps it neat, clean and smoothly functional. Every society or nation wants to create a beacon, to remind the

world and themselves what they were capable of but couldn’t achieve.

IIT is that in Indian education.” [37]

Autonomy at the IITs, then, is both structural and discursive. The

IITs’ status as institutions of national importance hinged on their
structural position outside and above the wider educational system.
IITians themselves have come to see the schism between the IITs and
other educational institutions as that between excellence and mediocrity and, increasingly, between nonstate and state spaces. These dis-

tinctions underwrite a claim to meritocracy that has only sharpened
over time alongside growing challenges to the IITs’ exclusivity.

78 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Internal Criticisms

Nazir Ahmed’s dissent on the Sarkar Committee report, in which he
warned against the strong possibility of institutional isolation, limited

impact, and undemo cratic limits to access, turned out to be quite pre-

scient. As early as 1969, critical reviews of the IITs began to circulate.
Some of these critical voices echoed Ahmed’s concern with the elitism

of the IITs and their inability to catalyze wider pro cesses of social

transformation. A case in point is the 1968 study of one unnamed IIT—
most likely IIT Delhi—by sociologists C. Rajagopalan and Jaspal
Singh. The sociologists looked into the caste and class backgrounds of
students to determine whether, as top- tier institutions, the IITs were

contributing to social mobility. The authors concluded their study with
the observation that the IITs’ goal of producing what they call a “potential elite” had made “only a limited contribution to social mo-

bility.” [38] The production of this new elite, as they saw it, was a pro cess

of social reproduction, not transformation.

Others were less concerned with elitism and more with the failure

of the proj ect to realize its own ambition of producing an elite corps of

engineers who would help with nation- building. Critics, such as Pro-

fessors S. P. Sukhatme and I. Mahadevan of IIT Bombay, pointed to the
developmental impact of the “brain drain” from the IITs as more and
more gradu ates opted to go abroad rather than work in India. [39] Others

characterized this outward fow in terms of a diminished tax base,
noting that “although the emigrant population can represent a small
fraction of the total population, the fscal effects are considerable
nonetheless.” [40]

IITians themselves have diverging opinions of the success of the IIT

proj ect, although very few object to the idea of an elite stratum of in-

stitutions where excellence is fostered. Deb, for instance, dispenses
with the charge of elitism by using an anecdote. He narrates an interaction between Ashok Jhunjhunwala, IIT Kanpur alumnus and professor at IIT Madras, and his Gandhian grand father. After receiving

admission to the IITs, Jhunjhunwala traveled to Lakhi Sarai, a small
town in Bihar, to meet his grand father. “ ‘So, you are joining this

Brahmin institute?’ the old man asked his grand son. ‘I was taken aback,

I didn’t understand what he was talking about,’ says Jhunjhunwala. ‘But


-----

BUILDING THE IITS 79

then I went to IIT and forgot all about it.’ ” [41] Deb goes on to recount a

later encounter with the grand father after Jhunjhunwala came back to

India from the United States. Returning to Lakhi Sarai, he asked his
grand father what he had meant by his comment years before. His

grand father admitted that initially, most Gandhians had found the IITs

elitist. After much debate, however, “they agreed that it was a good

thing. India had a tradition of elite educational institutes, exemplifed
by the ancient Buddhist university at Nalanda. The idea was to pick
the best people and train them. So you gave these institutes tremen-

dous resources, even in times of war or famine. The aim was to train
leaders for the country.” [42] Through the invocation of the Gandhian
grand father, Deb naturalizes the IITs as in continuity with “Indian tra-

dition” and justifes the social exclusions of the system. In one sense,
the invocation of tradition acknowledges the continuities in social
status underwriting the IITs. At the same time, Deb obfuscates caste
and class structures through recourse to a cultural notion of excellence.
Lost in this recourse to the ancient past is any question of how public
investment in the perpetuation of exclusionary excellence is to be reconciled with demo cratic transformation. Even while Deb decenters

Nehru the socialist in favor of Dalal the technocrat in his version of

the IIT story, his assessment of the IITs is very much in tune with Nehru’s valorizing of excellence over democracy.

While most IITians echo Deb in insisting on the need for a sepa-

rate stratum of institutions in which excellence is not sacrifced to
other considerations, there are those who criticize the IITs for not fully

developing their capacity for primary research. Even here, the concern

seems to be more with the IITs’ noncompetitiveness in the sphere of
scientifc discovery— several alumni bemoaned the absence of a single

Nobel prize winner among IITians— and less with how such an em-

phasis might shape the intellectual development of students or the social and economic welfare of the country. Instead, excellence is gauged
in terms of global competitiveness and recognition as goals in their
own right. As we will see in Chapter 7, this emphasis on global legi-

bility has assumed a more strictly market character with the rise of
Brand IIT.

Lost too in Deb’s invocation of the IITs’ continuity with the ancient

past is the question of whether the IITs do in fact “train leaders for the


-----

80 THE CASTE OF MERIT

country.” While he does address debates over diasporic mobility, Deb
ultimately endorses the presence of a successful diaspora as a net good
for India. Other alumni admit that IITians have not contributed as
much to the nation- building proj ect as they could have but insist that

the prob lem is with India and not the IITs. Professors Indiresan and

N. C. Nigam of IIT Delhi, for instance, argue that if Indian industry
had developed, “IIT gradu ates would have formed the core of creative

scientist- engineers required for such an effort.” They also maintain

that IITians will no doubt do so in the future “provided the goals of

excellence are preserved and supported.” [43]

While internal criticisms are typically muted, other perspectives

call into question the IITs’ claim to excellence by focusing on the caste
contours of meritocracy and the curricular orientation of the institutes.
Such arguments typically vary by region and speak to the particularities of regional history and of the institutes’ founding charters. They
speak as well to the tensions generated by the presence of elite central
government institutions within regions with their own social hierarchies and po liti cal proclivities. In Chapter 3, we will delve deeper into

how the history of caste, education, and employment in the southeastern region shaped the founding and reception of IIT Madras. This

discussion will set the stage for the book’s key argument about the role

of Tamilnadu as a pre ce dent for the making of upper casteness nation-

ally and transnationally.

#### Challenging Hierarchies
 of Value in Madras

A ll the institutions within the IIT system had certain unifying
characteristics: they fell under the jurisdiction of the Indian central

government, they drew students from across India, they were estab-

lished through collaboration with a foreign partner, and they were

funded at far higher levels than other engineering colleges. There were

also differences between them. The greater numbers of students from
the immediate vicinity gave each IIT a regional cultural favor. The
founding partnership was also a key factor in shaping the training stu-

dents received.

These distinguishing characteristics shaped the making of IIT

Madras. IIT Madras was set up with the active collaboration of the
Federal Republic of Germany, a relationship that continued a long history of transnational exchanges between Indians and Germans from
the period of British imperial hegemony. One of the unique features of
West German engineering was the privileging of technique over theory;
Germans located skill in the hands, not the head, and the engineer was
regarded frst and foremost as a skilled technician. Moreover, Germans
associated the technical labor of engineering with the production not

just of objects but of selves. The engineer became an expert and a person
through hands-on labor. In terms of training, these ideas translated

into an emphasis on the practical dimensions of engineering.

82 THE CASTE OF MERIT

The regional po liti cal context also shaped the founding of IIT Ma-

dras. As we saw in Chapter 1, the vast majority of colonial- era engi-

neers were from upper- caste backgrounds. Although many disdained

manual labor, they embraced engineering because it was a white- collar

profession whose status was enhanced by its relationship to conceptual knowledge and the colonial state. In many ways, Madras Presidency was an extreme case of technical education reinforcing existing
social hierarchies. Unlike other regions, where a wider spectrum of
upper castes entered engineering, Madras’s cadre of Indian engineers
had a disproportionate number of Brahmins. The predominance of
Brahmins in the modern professions— not just in engineering but also

in law and the bureaucracy— was a lightning rod for po liti cal opposi-

tion. The Non- Brahmin and Dravidian movements of the twentieth

century articulated a critique of Brahmin dominance and offered an
alternative vision of po liti cal society oriented around two key catego-

ries: the Hindu scriptural category of the Shudra, and the racial-
linguistic category of the Dravidian. In a more limited sense, they

also advanced arguments about caste hierarchies of knowledge and the
need to rethink the privileging of the ce re bral over the embodied.

Both the German approach to engineering and the po liti cal currents

that swept Madras sat uneasily with the forms of colonial and postcolonial institutional stratifcation we explored in Chapters 1 and 2. How,
then, did the German emphasis on self- fashioning through bodily tech-

nique and the Non- Brahmin and Dravidian critiques of Brahmin dom-

inance intersect with prevailing caste ideologies? Let us turn now to the
southeastern region and consider the founding of IIT Madras in relation to a longer regional history of caste and technical education. Our
exploration here of broader po liti cal trends will lead us to Chapter 4’s

closer look at the life histories of the 1960s generation of Madras IITians.
Across both chapters, we will explore how the tensions over the

founding and orientation of the institute shaped the perspectives of

IIT Madras’s frst cohorts.

Technical Education in Madras Presidency

Madras Presidency was one of the earliest regions where technical
education was launched in vari ous forms. It housed the frst survey

school, it had a concentration of Christian missionary trade schools offering vocational training for lower- caste converts, and it witnessed

some of the most innovative experiments in industrialization. Before
the founding of IIT Madras, the premier engineering institution in the
region was the Madras College of Engineering, previously named the
Madras Civil Engineering College and later renamed the College of En-

gineering, Guindy. The college was frst started in 1794 as a school to
train surveyors from the colony and reduce the cost of metropolitan
personnel in the East India Com pany’s Surveyor’s Department. Its stu-

dents were mainly trainees from among the destitute Eu ro pean and

Eurasian children in Madras Presidency’s schools. In the early 1820s,

the school was transferred to the Madras Revenue Department, and
training in leveling, drafting, and hydraulics was added to its roster.
In 1842, the government of Madras proposed a college where civil engineering could be taught. The East India Com pany’s Court of Direc-

tors rejected the proposal because the level of general education in the

colony was thought too low for candidates to absorb advanced training
in mathematical and technical sciences.

After the establishment of the Madras Public Works Department

in the 1850s, there were more consistent arguments for technical per-

sonnel. This time, the government was more amenable. In 1854, Governor General Dalhousie proposed that “a complete system of instruction” be provided to “ every class belonging to the Department of Public

Works, Eu ro pe ans, East Indians or Natives, whether Artifcers, Foreman

Overseers, Surveyors or Civil Engineers.” [1] In September 1859, the new
Madras Civil Engineering College opened with approximately one hundred students. By 1887, the diploma structure had stabilized to offer
three grades of training: four years for engineers; three and a half years
for engineer subordinates; and two years for sub- overseers, surveyors,

and draftsmen.

There are some noteworthy aspects of the progression of engineering

education in Madras Presidency that are relevant for understanding its
attraction to regional upper castes. First, the Madras Civil Engineering
College changed from a trade school in 1859 to an advanced teaching
institution in 1931, in the pro cess expanding its range of subjects to

include mathe matics, science, and engineering. The mathe matics cur-

riculum in par tic u lar expanded signifcantly to become a prominent


-----

84 THE CASTE OF MERIT

part of the engineering curriculum as a whole. Second, between 1857

and 1907, the college changed from a military to a civilian institution,
a shift symbolized by its affiliation to Madras University in 1859. This
was a mere two years after Cooper’s Hill College opened in England to

train engineers for exclusive ser vice in India. To maintain the racial

hierarchy in the engineering ser vices, the government ordered the Ma-

dras Civil Engineering College to limit its instruction to the lower
grades. However, the director of public instruction vehemently opposed
the government’s decision and forcefully argued that “it would be a retrograde and impolitic mea sure to abolish the Se nior Department of

the Civil Engineering College, as such a move would practically debar
the natives of the Presidency, and the Eu ro pean and Eurasians perma-

nently settled in it, from admission to the higher ranks of the Public
Works Department.” [2] As a result, the training of all grades continued
apace, and the college even enhanced its status through university affliation. Fi nally, the college curriculum was aligned with the require-

ments for the civil ser vice so that gradu ates were automatically eligible

for civil ser vice employment. All of these factors— the elevation of

mathe matics, the continuity in higher grades of training, and enhance-

ment of the opportunity for civil ser vice employment— signifcantly

shaped the regional status of engineering and its attraction for upper
castes. But what about the relationship between the theoretical and
practical dimensions of engineering education?

As in other parts of British India, Madras too witnessed a lively de-

bate over the appropriate balance of theoretical and practical training
in engineering education. From the outset, Public Works commissioners felt that the earlier survey school had not prepared students

theoretically, resulting in “a desultory mode of study, the effects of
which may be traced in the afterlife of the Surveyors.” [3] Se nior policy

makers envisaged a college to train scientifcally qualifed engineers
who would be man ag ers and not just technicians. In Chapter 1, we en-

countered Lieutenant George Winscom, the frst principal of the Madras Civil Engineering College, who believed that engineers needed a
“knowledge in Engineering science and intellectual vigor.” [4] At the same
time, Winscom had carried over from England and from the military a

preference for the practical man. These clashing opinions resulted in a

college with a dual emphasis on theoretical and practical training.


-----

CHALLENGING HIERARCHIES OF VALUE IN MADRAS 85

The theoretical orientation of the college came in for criticism by

employers frustrated by the lack of practical knowledge of the frst generations of students entering the colonial engineering ser vice. In re-

sponse, the director of public instruction issued a fervent defense of
the college in 1869. It was unreasonable, he argued, “to express surprise
that students fresh from the College are not experienced Overseers”
and to expect an engineering gradu ate, “without guidance, to build a

barrack, drain a Cantonment, or carry out an Irrigation proj ect with

as much rapidity and confdence as if he had done it all before.” [5] Still,
he granted that the purpose of the college was “to prepare its students
in the most efficient manner practicable for entering on the duties connected with the Engineering and Survey works of the country, with a
groundwork of such knowledge as is most essential to qualify for undertaking these duties, and such practical training as a place of instruc-

tion of this nature can afford.” [6] For the most part, the Madras college
continued its theoretically oriented approach to engineering. However,
the criticisms of excessive book learning continued, prompting a revision of the curriculum in 1881. From 1886, in addition to a three- year

course in theory, every student would spend a year undergoing prac-

tical training. The added emphasis on practical training and more priority given to the physical sciences, workshops, and laboratories met
with the approval of the Public Works Department.

Despite the ongoing insistence that practical training was founda-

tional to engineering, the trend in Madras, as elsewhere, was toward

privileging the theoretical over the practical. As engineering became
established as a profession rooted in mathematical science, it was increasingly distinguished from the practical vocations of industrial life.
The professionalization of engineering was crucial to its appeal to
upper castes, who saw it as a means to be modern, affiliated with the
colonial state, and endowed with rational, systemic forms of knowledge. Reports of the engineering college between 1884 and 1905 note
the preponderance of Brahmins over students from the “artisan classes

[which] should have the greatest natu ral aptitude” for engineering. [7] By

1921, Brahmins made up approximately 74 percent of engineering col-

lege students, despite being only 3 percent of the enumerated regional

population. [8] In the Public Works Department, Brahmins were the frst

Indians to gain prominence and take up se nior positions. In 1900, across


-----

86 THE CASTE OF MERIT

all grades, there were 67 engineers, of whom 58 (86.5 percent) were Eu-

ro pe ans, 8 (12 percent) were Brahmins, and 1 (1.5 percent) was a non-

Brahmin. [9] By 1919, of a total 535 employees, Brahmins numbered 398.
This included posts for superintendent engineers and 10 out of 14 posts
for executive engineers. [10] Even after 1920, when non- Brahmin numbers

rose, Brahmins continued to be overrepresented in the engineering profession, just as they were in administration and law. [11] Even compared

with other regions, then, Madras’s engineering profession was an upper-
caste stronghold.

When it came to industrial schooling, Madras Presidency stood out

once again. It was here that Alfred Chatterton embarked on his “pio-

neer factories” to build up the industrial and commercial strengths of
artisans. While Chatterton is best known as a British administrator
who advocated for artisanal entrepreneurship and state- led industrial-

ization, his role in instrumentalizing caste as the basis of industrial
development is less so. This comes through in his work in Madras.
Chatterton had an understanding of Tamil society, particularly Tamil
industrial life, as rooted in caste. It followed that industrial schooling
and development should similarly be structured around caste. “For the
indigenous industries,” he argued, “it seems inevitable that we must
have recourse to industrial schools, but I would suggest that instruction in each industry should be confned to the sons and relatives of
those actually engaged in the industry at the pre sent time: that is to

say, we should carry on the industrial schools on a caste basis.” Only
then would those who depend on indigenous industries for a livelihood

be benefted and not “have added to their difficulties the competition
of locally trained people belonging to the non- artisan castes.” [12] This

did not mean that Chatterton subscribed to prevalent caste hierarchies
of value in disparaging artisanship and other forms of manual production. On the contrary, he greatly admired the artisans he worked with
and expressed faith in their capacity for critical scrutiny and innovation. In speaking of farmers, weavers, and wood and metalworkers, he
argued that “the reputation that Indians are averse to all change and
are obstinately wedded to the antiquated ways of their forefathers is
not justly deserved. They are conservative but they know their own
business fairly well and many of the so- called improvements they re-

jected were really unsuitable innovations.” [13]


-----

CHALLENGING HIERARCHIES OF VALUE IN MADRAS 87

Unlike the sidelining of artisans in other regions, Chatterton’s pio-

neer factories attempted to enhance and channel their skills in order
to make them commercially viable. But while Chatterton’s primary

concern was to build up indigenous industry, and to do so without
displacing an existing artisanal population, his proposals further
strengthened and naturalized the link between caste and occupation.
His insistence that industrial schooling be housed with the Depart-

ment of Industries rather than the Department of Education more
clearly distinguished industrial workers from those headed to profes-

sional occupations. Although Chatterton’s effort to revalorize industrial work was laudable, colonial hierarchies of caste ultimately worked
against its resignifcation as a form of labor on par with the occupa-

tions of the high- born.

_State Technical Scholarships_

In Chapter 1, we encountered Daivasikhamani Achari, secretary of the
Kumbakonam Visvakarma Mahajana Conference Committee, who testifed before the Indian Industrial Commission about the sidelining of
artisans in the se lection pro cess for state technical scholarships. Let

us now look more closely at the regional se lection pro cess to see how

expectations were weighted in favor of the high- born even when it

came to nonprofessional tracks of technical training. To compensate
for the lack of practical training afforded to Indian gradu ates, the Con-

ference on Technical Education held at Simla in 1901 recommended
the institution of state technical scholarships to encourage Indian students to pursue further studies abroad. Ten scholarships were estab-

lished a year: two each for Bombay, Bengal, and Madras, and the remaining four for other local governments and administrations. The
stated purpose of the scholarship program was to encourage Indians to
take up further studies in the higher branches of technical education
and apply them to industrial development. The program was specifcally not for the study of engineering but for cultivating other forms of
technical training in industries that were impor tant to their regions.

In Madras, eleven scholarships were given between 1906 and 1915.

The application fles offer insight into the practices of evaluation that
informed colonial officialdom. Despite the stated requirements of educational accomplishments and practical experience, family background

and social networks were of utmost importance in determining the

success or failure of applicants. Even evidence of industry connections, which would have facilitated the application of new skills to industrial development— the very purpose of the scholarships— was ul-

timately less impor tant than who someone was socially.

The year the program was started, four applicants submitted their

requests for support, and none were awarded scholarships. One appli-

cation was from Mr. Pothery Koran, a clerk in the District Munsiff’s
Court in Cannanore, who applied “to go to Amer i ca or to England and

learn all arts in connection with the industry of weaving.” He described
himself as “a Hindu and Tiya by caste” who had “passed Matriculation Examination and Handwriting Test examination” and had a “fair
knowledge of En glish and Mathe matics.” Moreover, one of his brothers

was “a merchant and a partner in a Weaving Com pany on a small scale

at Chova in Cannanore.” If granted the scholarship, Pothery Koran
promised to “try my best to beneft all the Indians and especially the
people in my locality with the knowledge I acquire in this enterprise
of mine.” In his rejection of the application, E. W. Middlemarch, the
director of public instruction, merely stated that “the candidate seems
to me to be quite unsuitable. I would suggest that Mr. Chatterton be
commissioned to try and fnd a suitable candidate.” [14]

There is no further explanation for why Pothery Koran was unsuit-

able. What we do know is that he, a lower- caste weaver, was rejected

despite having the basic educational requirements and family connec-

tions in weaving that would have allowed him to apply his new skills
to the further development of a regional industry.

At times, applications were rejected despite testimonials of support

provided by community associations. This was the case with the application of M. Duraiswami, a textile student at the Victoria Jubilee
Technical Institute, who was a Sourashtrian native of Madura. Duraiswami stated in his application that the Sourashtrian community
“rightly deserves all sorts of encouragement at the hands of the Government, being classed as backward in education.” Moreover, he states
that “this community shared nowadays in all kinds of industry and is
thoroughly industrial. They now come the foremost in trade in Southern
India next only to the Nattukottai Chetties. If therefore industrial education is freely imparted to a poor scholar of this community, it is sure


-----

CHALLENGING HIERARCHIES OF VALUE IN MADRAS 89

to improve the pre sent status of industry of his own people, who now

form the bulk of the population of Madura which is a great centre of

trade, and the people at large.” Duraiswami further underscored that

his community “has a greater inclination to an industrial life than to
any other pursuit of life and the only great bar to any further develop-

ment in industry is want of education in a great majority of the popula-

tion and I am sure that the only way in which Government can help
them is to give them chance though a little out of turn.” [15]

Duraiswami’s letter was accompanied by a resolution by the coun-

cilors of the Sourashtra Sabha. The councilors pointed out that their
role in industrial development had been recognized by none other than
Lord Curzon, who, “during his visit to this city of historic fame as the
viceroy of India,” observed that their “immigration from Gujarat (the
ancient kingdom of Sourashtra) into this city was . . . responsible for

the propagation of the Industries of Weaving and Dyeing in Southern
India.” They then provided a narrative of decline: “This law- abiding

and peaceful community of weavers and dyers which received a severe
shock from the competition of the machine- made fabrics is slowly

bettering its industrial condition by the spread of En glish Education

which several of its members were enabled to receive by means of

scholarships bestowed upon them by the Government as members of
a community classed as backward in education.” The councilors ended
their letter with the conviction that “the prosperity of the industrial
population purely depends upon the fact that they should be educated
in the improved methods of industries” and that Duraiswami, “who,
as a member of the Sourashtra Community, has a natu ral aptitude for

this kind of study[,] . . . is pre- eminently ftted to receive instructions

in a Technical subject.” [16] Despite the council’s masterful rhetorical
framing and evidence that Duraiswami was an ideal candidate who
was well positioned to use the scholarship to buttress his technical
skill and contribute to his city’s industrial life, his application was rejected with but a single word of explanation: “unsuitable.”

Most of the applications were rejected on the basis of unsuitability.

This begs the question of who was deemed suitable. In Madras Presidency, the overwhelming number of successful applicants were men

from the Nair caste. While none of them had any history of technical skill, they came from well- connected families with a history of

education and government employment. Along with Tamil Brahmins, Nairs were among the earliest southerners to take advantage of

the opportunities afforded by modern education and the professions
and become part of the colonial bureaucracy. [17] This placed them in a
very dif fer ent position from the majority of applicants from artisanal

and trading castes who had a wealth of technical knowledge, along
with family and community histories in small- and large- scale in-

dustry, but were of lower social status.

The frst successful applicant was V. G. Nair, a clerk in the Pusa

Agricultural Research Institute, who applied to study textile chemistry. In response to his application, the Madras Educational Department wrote to the director of Pusa to request his opinion on “ whether

V. G. Nair is a suitable candidate for a scholarship and particularly
whether he is a man of good physique and to what family in Malabar

he belongs.” [18] The family history provided allowed him to pass muster.

Another successful applicant was K. Krishna Menon, who was

vouched for by none other than Ravi Varma, the sixth prince of Cochin. The prince attested not only to Menon’s educational credentials
but to the standing of his family. “His father, who held several respon-

sible posts in Cochin State with credit to himself and advantage to the
State, is a member of one of the most respectable Nair Tarwads (families) in Cochin. Mr. Krishna Menon is my brother’s brother- in- law. I

have known him from his cradle. He is an amiable young man full of
energy and bears an excellent character.” Ravi Varma concluded with
the opinion that, if granted a scholarship, Menon would “prove himself worthy of such trust, of the Education he has received and of his
respectable parentage and his connections.” Varma’s personal assessment was buttressed by a letter bearing the seal of the Cochin Durbar
that certifed “that Mr. K. Krishna Menon belongs to a respectable
family in Ernakulam. He is an intelligent, honest, hardworking and
well- behaved young man.” [19]

Fi nally, we have Ramunni Panikkar, who was awarded a two- year

scholarship in 1907 to study tanning. Mr. H. D. Taylor, acting secretary of the Educational Department, laid out his social standing thus:
“M. A. Ramunni Panikkar is a native of Malabar and a Nayar by caste.
He comes from a well- to-do family of good social position. His father,


-----

V. Damodara Panikkar, is a retired Sub- Registrar and is now a Bench

Magistrate at Palghat; and one of his brothers is the adikari or headman

of a village in one of the taluks of South Malabar.” [20] Panikkar was in
competition with another applicant, Abraham B. Salem, who applied
to study fsheries and fsh curing. Salem was a clerk to fsheries director
Frederick Nicholson. Nicholson’s favorable recommendation noted the
following about Salem:

[He is a] Jew by nationality and religion, smart, well educated, and
pushing; belonging to the West Coast, he is acquainted with the merchants and trades of the coast, and he is strongly desirous of working
at the fshery business and especially at the curing branch of the industry. He has acquired a good deal of fshery knowledge while in my
office, having been on tour with me and in de pen dently; he will do

much better as a practical man than at mere office work and I can
rely on him not to waste his time or opportunities; his energy is
shown by his attaining his B.A. and B.L. degrees in the face of much
difficulty; and he is the frst Jew to obtain a degree. [21]

Despite Salem’s qualifcations and experience in the fshing in-

dustry, and the considerable doubt cast on whether Panikkar would

even continue in the tanning feld, the latter was chosen. Even those

who recommended advancing both applicants used the occasion to express their anti- Semitism in less than subtle terms: “I submit that the

names both of Panikkar and Salem may be submitted, preference being
given to the former. Mr. Panikkar informed me that he had private
means. Nothing is known in this re spect of Mr. Abraham B. Salem ex-

cept that he is a Jew, and that with him ‘time is money.’ ” [22]

Alfred Chatterton, who was on the board reviewing applications for

the scholarship, was frustrated by the mismatch between experience,
prospects for future employment, and se lection. He pointed out that of

those selected, “few have any knowledge of or connection with the industry in India which they propose to take up.” As a result, apart from
“the rare case where the technical student belongs to a family already

engaged in manufacturing work,” foreign returnees typically languished without a professional career. [23] Still, the scholarships continued

to be granted to applicants who had the desired social, not technical,


-----

92 THE CASTE OF MERIT

qualifcations. In the pro cess, they reinforced the upward mobility of

high- status groups while doing little to support those applicants who

came from histories of technical skill.

Non- Brahminism and Dravidianism

The social profle of engineering students and the fate of most applicants for state technical scholarships make clear that Madras Presidency was a particularly striking instance of the pan- Indian tracking

of castes into dif fer ent tiers of training. However, there was an added

form of classifcation that lent a dif fer ent texture to regional caste dis-

tinction. Consider this quote from the director of public instruction’s
report for 1906–1907: “Out of the large population of this Presidency,
less than three thousand children were receiving technical instruction

in the vari ous handicrafts and of these less than nine hundred were

_non-_ _Brahmin Hindus,_ the class of the community to which the bulk

of hereditary workers in wood and metal and textile fabrics belong.
There is as yet little demand for technical education, and the little

advance that has been made has practically left unaffected the great

mass of the industrial population.” [24] Here we see not only the emphasis

on enhancing “hereditary” occupations, a code for caste labor, but

also how the expansion of technical education in Madras increasingly hinged on the distinction between Brahmin and non- Brahmin

populations.

In Madras Presidency, the category of the “non- Brahmin” had ac-

crued salience over the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
The distinction between non- Brahmin and Brahmin entailed the ideo-

logical reduction of the region’s remarkable social diversity and complex forms of stratifcation into two consolidated, opposed groupings.
This pro cess was precipitated by a variety of factors, including Orien-

talist scholarship, Anglo- Indian law, and bureaucratic centralization.

Here I offer a broad- brush history of the social and po liti cal transforma-

tions that precipitated the polarization of Brahmin and non- Brahmin

and set the stage for subsequent Tamil Brahmin claims to meritocracy.

From the fourteenth to the eigh teenth century, the regional land-

scape of social power and po liti cal authority was characterized by

heterogeneity. The south was highly decentralized, with no central


-----

CHALLENGING HIERARCHIES OF VALUE IN MADRAS 93

governmental mechanism capable of redistributing resources or maintaining an army. Po liti cal decentralization was also mirrored in com-

mercial networks that were never consolidated in urban centers. Even

when it came to conceptions of morality, there was no regional con-

sensus. Rather, there were discontinuities and tensions between upper

castes, with their Vedic ritual traditions, and the larger mass of people,

who participated in localized, non- Vedic forms of worship. All of these

factors contributed to a remarkable diversity of social arrangements of
power and forms of stratifcation across subregions and ecological
zones. [25]

To the extent that there were structuring forms of power that ap-

plied regionally, they were encapsulated in three institutions: _kaniachi,_

kingship, and religion. The _kaniachi_ system, which allocated shares
in property based on prior settlement, allowed corporate groups to
make genealogical claims to land owner ship. Kingly power was acces-

sible to many warrior castes, which would lay claim to legitimacy
through military force and lineage organ ization, and often involved the

mediation of priestly authority. In terms of control over resources, kingship was typically expressed through the symbolic incorporation of
river valley _kaniachikarar_ communities and the disbursement of land
grants to Brahmins in the uplands. The third source of power was the
temple, where honor and status derived from ser vices performed for the

gods. By donating lands, money, and products to temples, social groups

would accrue rights to participate in ceremonies and receive gifts from
the gods that underwrote their local status. Kings, too, were major do-

nors to temples, a practice through which they ritually incorporated

the social order of their domains and established their authority. This
tripartite structure of _kaniachi,_ kingly, and divine authority fostered
competition for honors and status through which groups could elevate
and transform their standing in regional society.

The existence of multiple ave nues of mobility made precolonial

claims to status variable and dynamic. The occupations, ritual practices, and social groups associated with high status varied across context. The rules of social pre ce dence were similarly dynamic. Donations

to temples could bring honor and the means to redefne status. Caste

bound aries were commonly reset through participation in religious

sects associated with infuential seers. New claims to status were also


-----

made through emulation. Landowning groups such as the Vellalas, for
instance, emulated Brahmins by being purity conscious and developing
Brahminical qualities of vegetarianism, scholarship, and con spic u ous

piety. However, even this varied across ecological zones. While emulation of Brahmins was more prevalent in the agricultural zones, groups
in the uplands paid little attention to the culture of purity and rested

their claims to privilege on kingly attributes of power and martial tradition. Furthermore, because of the way endogamy was localized and

status was tied to the achievement of royal and temple honors, the same

caste could have a very dif fer ent standing in dif fer ent localities.

The defning characteristic of regional caste society, then, was on-

kings, and Brahmins distributed rights and privileges and allowed social groups to vie going contestation. Between them, _kaniachikarars,_
for relative status. This is not to say that the region was nonhierarchical. Although status was fuid, it entailed jostling for position
within a hierarchically ordered society. However, there was an external

limit to these forms of maneuver. Unlike all other groups— Hindu,

Muslim, and Christian alike, who by the eigh teenth century partici-

pated in competitions over pre ce dence and honors— untouchable castes

were explic itly excluded from access to the three institutions that me-

diated claims- making. This rigidity of status beyond the bounds of

“clean” caste society was seen most clearly in the Thanjavur delta,
where untouchable castes constituted the mass of agricultural laborers
whose bonded servitude was an inherited condition.

Colonial rule brought far- reaching transformations to South Indian

society. In the agrarian economy, the colonial state instituted a system
of private property, which broke up the _kaniachi_ system of corporate
rights and vested owner ship in individuals. Private property undercut

the forms of reciprocity that had structured the relationship between
_kaniachikarars,_ tenants, and landless laborers, allowing the landed to
accumulate wealth with no regard for the customary rights of non-
elites or for maintaining the infrastructure of agrarian production. At
the same time, colonial rule in the south did not lead to the establishment of a _zamindari_ class of landowners. Rather, the revenue system
that developed over the nineteenth century was based on the direct

taxation of peasant house holds. Although cap i tal ist transformation

made the peasant economy more unequal during this period, there was


-----

CHALLENGING HIERARCHIES OF VALUE IN MADRAS 95

no associated loss of land rights and expansion of proletarian labor. Fur-

thermore, the exodus of landowners to the towns in the early twentieth century opened up new land for purchase, leading to the prolif-

eration of petty landownership and the conscription of family rather

than wage labor. [26]

The fragmentation of agrarian landholdings resulted in a decline in

productivity and precipitated an exodus from villages to towns, whose
rapid growth made them the new centers of economic development.
Between 1921 and 1961, the urban population grew almost three times
as fast as the rest of the state. These shifts in population transferred

power from the river valleys and coasts to the upland plains. As in the
rural economy, urban economic development did not lead to the concentration of wealth and the expansion of an urban proletariat. While
a small segment of the urban population was employed in modern factories, the sectors of the economy that expanded most rapidly were

petty commerce, informal trading, and government employment. Between 1901 and 1951, approximately one- third of the total increase in

urban population was in white- collar employment, and it was in this

sector that Brahmin dominance was most apparent. Brahmins’ early
exposure to En glish literacy and modern education, in part through the

efforts of Christian missionary socie ties, became a signifcant advan-

tage with urbanization. Despite being only 3 percent of the regional

population, Brahmins were overrepresented in higher education and

government ser vice, where they constituted 70–80 percent of gradu ates

and native employees. Even with the introduction in the 1910s of communal awards, or reserved quotas for non- Brahmin candidates, there

were few who had the literacy and education to take up the posts, with
the result that the proportion of Brahmins in government employment
was even higher in 1927 than it had been in 1900. [27]

Apart from economic changes, colonial rule ushered in adminis-

trative and legal changes that transformed the status claims of the pre-

colonial period. By making courts of law the sole rights- defning au-

thority, the colonial state undercut the more dispersed and varied forms
of po liti cal authority, which had underwritten localized customary

rights and community identities. The centralization of authority came
with new bureaucratic mechanisms, such as the census that transformed what had been a dynamic pro cess of status contestation into a


-----

96 THE CASTE OF MERIT

static form of caste ascription. In addition, Anglo- Indian law enshrined

a notion of tradition heavi ly infuenced by an understanding of San-

skritic Hinduism, which was at odds with the variability in local forms
of worship. The extension of Sanskritic conceptions of rank, or _varnashramadharma,_
elevated Brahmins above their erstwhile competitors for status, who were now classifed as Shudra, the groups occu-

pying the fourth rung of the _varna_ hierarchy. [28]

The new fxity accorded to caste status involved a reconceptualiza-

tion of caste as a form of collectivity rooted in blood and birth, not
practice. In effect, colonial rule racialized caste as heredity, a shift that
was profoundly consequential for understandings of caste continuity
and change. Instead of caste membership being tied to both birth and
codes of conduct, “birth and be hav ior became separated in people’s

minds such that birth alone came to defne group membership.” [29]
When it came to Brahmins, Maratha Brahmins were the frst to pio-

neer the model of the modern Brahmin as one who could take on new
practices outside the bounds of ritual prescription without losing
caste. [30] When this colonial- era model of Brahminness circulated to

Tamil Brahmins, they took it up by embracing new professions while
remaining frmly invested in their caste identity. This new understanding of caste as rooted primarily in heredity facilitated the entry

31
of Brahmins into felds such as medicine and engineering in high numbers, despite this being a radical shift in caste practice.

The racialization of caste came with certain presumptions about

the innate propensities of distinct groups. The British approach to caste
as heredity, combined with the active role of Brahmin intermediaries
in the making of colonial knowledge, produced the notion of the
Brahmin as innately intelligent and destined to lead. Molony, a British
civil servant in Madras, was representative of this outlook. Writing
about the success of Brahmins in colonial Madras, Molony drew on
eugenics to opine that their “refusal of intermarriage seems understandable. The higher race sought to preserve the purity of its blood.”
It was this purity, he added, that had allowed the Brahmin to take “the
lead in South Indian politics in virtue of his intellectual superiority;
for the same reason, he enjoyed a practical mono poly of lucrative em-

ployment under the foreign government which he professed to detest.” [32]

Such opinions were echoed by the Tamil Brahmin intelligent sia.


-----

CHALLENGING HIERARCHIES OF VALUE IN MADRAS 97

R. Swaminatha Aiyar, a retired deputy collector, insisted that “the
Brahmans constitute a type superior to other castes.” Intercaste marriage, he opined, “must inevitably lead to further deterioration of the
Brahmans, physically, mentally, and spiritually.” [33]

Alongside the legal codifcation of Sanskritic Hinduism, the colo-

nial state transformed temples from institutions intimately linked to

the patronage of mercantile and agrarian elites into public trusts
with absolute power over managing the resources at their disposal. In
the pro cess, it undercut the long- standing reciprocity between priests

and worshippers and the role of the deity as a redistributive authority
through which honors were bestowed on donors from a wide range of

social groups. This newfound institutional autonomy made Brahmin
priests and their gods far less beholden to donors and signifcantly circumscribed social claims on the temple. Moreover, the rigidifcation

of caste undercut the claims of those who were now regarded as too

lowly for participation in the honors system. [34]

These changes loosened the ties of Brahmins to other social

groups, especially those who were most proximate in status. The frac-

turing of the _kaniachi_ system, the codifcation of Brahminical norms
in Anglo- Indian law, the severing of ties between the temple and its

erstwhile patrons, and their near mono poly of education and govern-

ment employment granted Brahmins a newly fxed position as social
superiors. This discrepancy between the precolonial fuidity of status
and the fxity of caste hierarchy, which accorded Brahmins a permanent status written by colonial law and governance, was a key catalyst
for Non- Brahminism.

Non- Brahminism began in the 1910s as a politics spearheaded by

elite non- Brahmins. Their reduction to the _varna_ category of Shudra

within Anglo- Indian law grated against such groups, who had been

competitors with Brahmins for status and were now placed on par with

those they considered social inferiors. The Justice Party, formed in 1916
as one of the earliest non- Brahmin po liti cal organ izations, counted

among its patrons many merchants and landowners, who used their
social and economic power to challenge the rising status of Brahmins
in the colonial public sphere. [35]

The party announced its po liti cal arrival through the publication of

the “Non- Brahmin Manifesto,” which laid out a case against Brahmin


-----

98 THE CASTE OF MERIT

hegemony in the nationalist movement, modern education, and the
professions. The manifesto called for greater non- Brahmin repre sen-

ta tion in the emerging po liti cal and economic arenas of South Indian

society and challenged colonial assumptions of the Brahmin’s innate
intellectual superiority and leadership. In part, it did so by transforming
Brahmin intelligence from nature to history. Justice Party ideologues
advanced an argument about caste expropriation by making Brahmin
social and cultural capital the product of expropriated non- Brahmin

labor. As T. M. Nair, one of the party’s found ers, argued, “The Brahmins

toiled not, neither did they spin. The sweated slaves supplied them
with every thing, and they in turn cultivated ‘spirituality.’ ” Nair and

others advanced their own labor theory of value, which elevated non-

Brahmin productivity over Brahmin non- productivity. Non- Brahmins

were recast as “the toilers, the producing communities” whose work
“made pos si ble the riches of Indian civilization.” [36] In equating manual

labor with the production of value, Non- Brahminists reconstituted

Brahmin intellectualism as nonproductive and parasitic. While the
Justice Party was largely supportive of British rule— a position that

gained it notoriety— its leaders did charge colonialism with expanding

the possibilities of Brahmin expropriation of non- Brahmin labor and

wealth through the extension of caste power from the otherworldly
domain of religion to the worldly domains of law and politics.

One manifestation of the Justice Party’s emphasis on productive

labor was its endorsement of technical education. Justice Party leaders
called for a comprehensive educational model, with mass primary education as a foundation. This was necessary, they argued, to address
“the hiatus that existed between the demands of formal literacy,”
which many non- Brahmins could not meet, “and a certain kind of ex-

periential and ‘guild’ knowledge which they knew they possessed.” [37]
It was only with formal literacy that non- Brahmin producers could

avail themselves of the technical education offered by the colonial government and enhance their standing in the worlds of industry and
commerce. As with the comparative methodology of anticolonial nationalism, Justice Party ideologue Theagoraya Chetti compared India’s
paltry advance in technical training unfavorably to Japan’s: “In British
India, with a population of 255 millions, the universities have 36,000
students pursuing a literary course, while only 12,000 study in tech-


-----

CHALLENGING HIERARCHIES OF VALUE IN MADRAS 99

nical schools, which teach mostly type- writing, book- keeping, short-

hand, etc. Japan on the other hand with a population of 51 millions has

only 7500 students pursuing a literary course in its universities whereas
2,900,000 pupils attend technical schools.” [38] Only an educational
model prioritizing the technical, Chetti argued, would lead the way out
of the existing system, which produced only “automatic quill- drivers,

indifferent school masters and pettifogging lawyers rather than com-

petent agriculturists, technicians and tradesmen.” [39] Instead, the _Non-_
_Brahman,_ the Justice Party’s En glish paper, valorized forms of produc-

tive and commercial labor. “The greatest demand for our community

at the pre sent time,” it argued, “is a Commercial and an Industrial

university. . . . We still carry the martial spirit in us that rebels against

40
crams and mocks at the worthless examinations of the Madras University.” The paper called for the empowerment of non- Brahmin youth

as “merchants, skilled laborers and mechanics who can earn a hundred
rupees a month by striking the hammer with their sinewy hands on
iron and steel.” [41] Following the 1919 Montagu- Chelmsford Reforms,

which instituted a system of limited representative government at the

provincial level, the Justice Party came to power in Madras and promoted industrial development through physical and educational infrastructure as a key policy goal.

Non- Brahminist arguments for rethinking the hierarchies of labor

were rhetorically power ful. However, they were in tension with and

ultimately far less consequential than the demand for reservation in
professional and po liti cal spheres of Brahmin dominance. During the

Justice Party’s rule in Madras from 1921 to 1926, and again in 1930, it
institutionalized the reservation of government jobs for dif fer ent cat-

egories of non- Brahmins. In a display of rhetorical prowess, Justice

Party ideologues likened these modern, putatively caste- free spaces to

the rural _agraharam,_ or Brahmin quarter, and argued that government
employment needed to be both desacralized and desegregated. [42] The
_Dravidan,_ the Tamil newspaper of the Justice Party, quipped that the
Madras Presidency’s All- India Congress Committee, in which thirteen

out of ffteen members were Brahmins, should be called the “All- India

Agraharam Committee.” [43] Similarly, the Madras High Court Vakil’s
Association (an association of lawyers) was likened to a caste body

because of its overwhelmingly Brahmin membership. By extending the


-----

100 THE CASTE OF MERIT

meta phor of the _agraharam_ in this way, Non- Brahminists deliberately

confated rural and urban, sacred and secular, and nonmodern and
modern to show how suffused modern po liti cal and professional spaces

were by logics of caste. But rather than pushing for an end to caste-
based recruitment in government jobs and the professions, they argued
that the application of communal quotas would make the composition
of these spaces better refect regional demography.

The demand for quotas also pointed to another key argument of

Non- Brahminism: the self- interestedness or non- universality of

Brahmin leadership. The Justice Party rejected the idea that Brahmins
could represent the greater social good. Instead, its ideologues argued
that Brahmins were incapable of po liti cal neutrality because their pri-

mary concern was to protect caste privilege, as seen in the sustained
opposition within the nationalist movement to demo cratizing party

and professional spaces through communal quotas. In this way, they
refuted the Brahmin claim to po liti cal modernity and identifed non-

44
Brahmins instead as the true moderns motivated by concerns of justice and equality.

While the Justice Party remained an elite formation, the Self Re-

spect Association that followed in 1926 was more able to tap the roots
of mass discontent. The association was founded by E. V. Ramasami
Naicker, or Periyar, who later renamed it the Dravida Kazhagam (Party

of the Dravidians, or DK). The term “Dravidian” drew inspiration from
the scholarship of philologist Max Mueller and linguist Robert
Caldwell, whose racial- linguistic theories posited a divide between

an autochthonous Dravidian– non- Brahmin population and Aryan-

Brahmin settlers. [45] The son of an affluent merchant from the artisanal
Balija Naidu caste, whose father was the patron of a temple, Periyar

aligned himself with those who experienced the downside of colonial

modernization. His message of reviving a communal economy of distributed rights struck a chord with urban artisans, rural mi grants, and

others who were shut out of the most coveted arenas of urban employ-

ment. Periyar’s critique of Sanskritic religion also resonated with those

who experienced as alien and denigrating the forms of caste religiosity
underwritten by Anglo- Indian law that were increasingly prevalent in

upland towns. The DK under Periyar lent Dravidian politics a more

iconoclastic and subaltern favor and extended its reach beyond the


-----

CHALLENGING HIERARCHIES OF VALUE IN MADRAS 101

elite public sphere. His public rituals— burning Hindu sacred texts and

breaking idols; holding events at inauspicious times; organ izing beef-

eating ceremonies; and wearing black and celebrating the antagonists
of Hindu epics, like the demon- king Ravana of the Ramayana— took

Dravidianism into the sphere of everyday cultural practice. Periyar’s
use of bawdy language in popu lar journals; his antireligious, rationalist

rhe toric; his sensationalized per for mances; and his choice of public

meetings to convey his messages were all tactics intended to consti-

tute a subaltern public. [46]

Periyar placed the blame for the elevation of the Brahmin over the

non- Brahmin on the ideology of _varnashramadharma_ and argued that

it was this structure of value that deprived the Shudra of self- respect.

Contra Mohandas Gandhi’s idealized version of caste as a system of
interdependent complementarity, he insisted that caste- based occupa-

tions would ensure the perpetuation of existing patterns of social dominance. At the same time, Periyar had an ambivalent relationship
with the category of Shudra. Even as he located the Shudra at the core
of his conception of the Dravidian community, he was indignant about
the demotion of groups like his own to Shudra status. Moreover, his
valorization of the Shudra maintained the outsider status of Scheduled
Castes (SCs). While there were certainly times when Periyar aligned

himself with the strug gles of SCs, his preoccupation with the relative

status of the Shudra kept in place the graded inequalities of caste. Ultimately, Dravidian politics was unwilling to fully address the disabilities of caste experienced most palpably by SCs. The legacies of this
preoccupation with status is still evident in today’s intractable con-

ficts between Backward Castes and Dalits. [47]

From the 1930s to the 1960s, Dravidian politics gained momentum

through a sharper focus on opposing the Indian National Congress. The
Congress in Tamilnadu was led by the elite benefciaries of colonial
modernization: Brahmins, educated professionals, wealthy landowners,
and businessmen. Three Congress policies in par tic u lar became pivots

of Dravidianist critique and mobilization. First, Brahmin leaders in the
Congress pushed for greater legal and state control over the affairs of

temples, a step that was interpreted by Dravidianists and their sympathizers as advancing the further consolidation of Brahmin caste power
over religious life. Second, the Congress argued against the application


-----

102 THE CASTE OF MERIT

of communal quotas in recruitment to government jobs, which threatened the already tenuous hold of non- Brahmin groups in this most

dynamic and coveted employment sector. Third, the party passed a
resolution to make Hindi the national language, a move that antagonized aspirants to government jobs, who feared that these jobs would

now be claimed by northern mi grants. The Hindi Resolution catalyzed

the DK’s most successful mobilization. By equating the imposition of
Hindi with the hegemony of three “alien” forces— Aryanism, Brah-

minism, and Hinduism— Periyar constituted the Dravidian commu-

nity, or Kudi Arasu (Republic of the Popu lar Community), as a non-

Brahmin Tamil collective. [48]

While Periyar’s message reached groups well beyond the elite core

of the Justice Party, it was the formation of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK, or Party of Dravidian Uplift) in 1949 that gave Dravidianism a truly mass character. The DMK built on certain aspects
of the DK’s platform and departed from others that limited the latter’s

appeal. Under its frst two leaders, C. N. Annadurai and M. Karu-

nanidhi, the DMK held on to the idea of the Shudra, or Backward
Caste core of the Dravidian community. The DMK also reinforced Periyar’s critique of the cultural and caste bases of Indian nationalism but
added the alleged economic neglect of South India. Despite clear evidence that the south was rapidly industrializing, the DMK advanced
its critique of underdevelopment by arguing that the Nehruvian focus
on large- scale enterprises was contrary to the property regime rooted

in Tamil tradition. [49] In expanding the conception of Dravidianism to
foreground Tamil language and regional territory as unifying ingredients, the DMK also departed from the DK’s anti- Brahmin, antireligious

rhe toric. Instead, the party framed the Dravidian not as a racialized

caste collective but as an ethnic territory defned by linguistic and cultural commonality, a shift that allowed for the symbolic reincorporation of Tamil Brahmins. The opposition to Hindi as a national language
was a particularly power ful ingredient of the DMK’s growth in the

1950s and 1960s. Although the Congress in Madras did advance language policies favoring Tamil, such as the publishing of scientifc and
technical textbooks in Tamil, introducing the Tamil typewriter, and
making Tamil the language of administration in many government de-


-----

CHALLENGING HIERARCHIES OF VALUE IN MADRAS 103

partments, the party was outpaced by the DMK when it came to
linking language to Tamil mytho- history. [50]

The use of cinema was particularly effective in communicating

Dravidianist conceptions of culture and history to a mass audience.
Annadurai and Karunanidhi were both flm scriptwriters who re-

cruited a raft of stars for their po liti cally charged flms and, through

these appeals, dramatically expanded the electorate to include small
farmers and laborers who had never voted before or had simply gone
along with the Congress’s machine politics. [51] Through these vari ous

strategies, the DMK more defnitively shifted the class affiliation of
Dravidianism from the Justice Party’s original base of elite non-
Brahmins to lower- class groups and small property owners. This was

no longer just a politics of elite resentment; it had become one of subaltern assertion.

The DMK’s ability to capture a broad base of popu lar support led to

its unseating of the Congress in 1967. The DMK has since experienced
a number of internal schisms, most signifcantly the defection in 1972
of the charismatic actor- turned- politician M. G. Ramachandran (MGR),

whose breakaway party, the Anna- DMK (ADMK), emerged as the main

alternative to the DMK. MGR is credited with using his flm personalities and paternalistic appeals to woo the Tamil poor away from the
Congress and the DMK. As the DMK had done with the Congress,
MGR charged the DMK with elitism and projected his own ADMK as
the party of the Tamil poor. In a fve- year campaign that carried him

to victory, MGR branded the DMK a middle- class party that had con-

solidated its base among socially power ful Tamils and was uncon-

cerned about the plight of the masses. By the time the ADMK came to
power in 1977, MGR’s rhe toric had split the meaning of Dravidianism,

with the DMK as the vehicle of middle- class self- assertion and the

ADMK as the party of the poor, centered on the fgure of a benevolent
leader. [52] Despite such po liti cal fux, however, Tamilnadu’s formal po-

liti cal arena has been controlled by Dravidianist parties since the late

1960s, with power alternating between the DMK and the ADMK.

The legacy of Non- Brahminism and Dravidianism is evident in a

Tamil “structure of feeling.” [53] Although Brahmin privilege relative to
other high- status non- Brahmins was more of a colonial phenomenon


-----

104 THE CASTE OF MERIT

and one largely concentrated in education and the professions, the two
movements projected Brahmin dominance and non- Brahmin subjuga-

tion into the distant past as enduring features of Tamil society. By the
mid- twentieth century, the understanding of Brahmins as uniquely

privileged and of non- Brahmins as long subjugated had acquired broad

ac cep tance in Madras Presidency. Later Dravidianist emphases on re-

gional sovereignty, linguistic identity, and the technical professions
have also become key ingredients of postcolonial Tamil life.

In terms of policies too, the continuities are clear. It was not only

the Justice Party and the DK who pushed for quotas. By the time of inde pen dence, the argument for non- Brahmin quotas echoed across the

regional po liti cal spectrum. In 1951, Madras’s Congress government

under K. Kamaraj, the party’s frst lower- caste chief minister, intro-

duced a 25 percent quota for Backward Castes in educational institu-

tions and state government jobs. Unlike in other parts of India, the
Congress in Madras based the quotas exclusively on caste criteria and
included a much higher 51 percent of the population in the list of Back-

ward Castes. With this move, Kamaraj received the blessing of Periyar,
who called him a _pachchai Tamizhan_ (pure Tamil) and proclaimed that
such preferential policies, even under a Congress government, could

still be a counterweight to Brahmin social power. [54]

The continuing valorization of the technical is evident in the pace

of change in postcolonial Tamilnadu, which rapidly became one of the
most industrialized states in the Indian Union. It is also refected in
the proliferation of institutions of technical education across the state.
Despite the ideological work done by Non- Brahminism to unsettle hi-

erarchies of labor and value, what has carried through most effectively

to the postcolonial period is the demand for demo cratizing access to

the professions. If anything, the stratifcation of technical training has
hardened non- Brahmin opposition to occupations associated with

lower- caste labor and claims to more valorized pursuits. To put it dif-

ferently, technical education has been more a vehicle for advancing
status claims than for transforming the caste bases of value. A clear
instance of this occurred in 1953, when the government of Congress
chief minister, C. Rajagopalachari, introduced a scheme for part- time

craft education during school hours to train students for non- white-

collar careers. The frst session would involve regular teaching, whereas


-----

the second would have students being sent home to learn the occupations of their parents. Criticism arose immediately and was spearheaded
by the DMK, which dubbed the scheme the _kula kalvi thittam,_ or
“hereditary education policy,” that would perpetuate caste barriers to
occupational mobility. Rajagopalachari’s Brahmin identity was also
deployed to discredit the scheme. Despite the government’s decision
to defer the scheme, public opposition built and, in combination with
hostility toward other policies— especially the effort to impose Hindi

as a national language— eventually forced the resignation of Rajago-

palachari. His successor, K. Kamaraj, dropped the scheme in 1954 in a
public show of his allegiance to Non- Brahminism. Today, the desire

for professional technical education as a means to lower- caste uplift

and assertion is evident in the proliferation of engineering colleges
in Tamilnadu. By the late 1990s, the state had outpaced all others in

the number of such colleges. As we will see in the following chapters,

the mushrooming of regional public and private engineering colleges
has thrown the presence of IIT Madras into sharper relief and
made it a lightning rod for caste critiques that recycle the terms of
Dravidianism.

To what extent has Dravidian rule transformed the po liti cal

economy of caste in Tamilnadu? The arenas in which its impact is
most palpable are public education and government employment, where
reservation for lower castes has increased their share of seats and jobs.
However, such steps have not addressed the rapidly expanding business
and commercial sectors, which since as early as the 1960s became the
new focus of wealth accumulation and elite aspiration. Moreover, to
the extent that upper castes pursued government careers after the

1960s, they tended to be in the central government, where quotas were

limited to members of SCs and Scheduled Tribes. In this sense, even
lower- caste quotas have not had as signifcant an impact on the re-

distribution of wealth as might be assumed. The patronage politics of
Dravidian parties expressed through handouts to the poor have been
supported not by progressive taxation but by sales taxes, government
borrowing, and other initiatives that have not adversely affected the
wealthy. In addition, state support for entrepreneurialism deepened
networks of private capital that disproportionately favored caste and
class elites. These trends were reinforced in the 1970s and 1980s under


-----

106 THE CASTE OF MERIT

MGR. His ADMK government further entrenched the economic conservatism of the DMK, which he offset in popu lar perception through

highly vis i ble ventures— such as a Midday Meals Scheme to feed the

poor— that were linked to his own heroic imagery in flms as a benevo-

lent patron. The post-1990 period of economic liberalization has witnessed the rapid rise in private sector accumulation by upper castes and
the consolidation of po liti cal power by dominant Other Backward Class

(OBC) groups tied to networks of Dravidianist party patronage. The
latter trend has been particularly inimical to Dalits, who have borne
the brunt of OBC vigilante vio lence aimed at checking their economic

and po liti cal aspirations. In all these ways, socioeconomic in equality

has grown under Dravidianist rule even as the rhe toric of caste rights

suffused Tamilnadu. [55]

How have Tamil Brahmins responded to these currents of change?

As we shall see in the following chapters, despite their economic power

in the domestic and transnational private sectors and in certain cultural spaces, there is a palpable sense among Tamil Brahmins of their

own victimization by a non- Brahmin majority and resort to notions of

caste- based intellectual merit to reclaim their standing. [56] A crucial

part of this defense in the name of meritocracy is a claim to middle

classness. Class has become a critical alibi that makes pos si ble a rec-

onciliation between caste inheritances and the demo cratic princi ple of

meritocracy. While Tamil Brahmins are an early instance of this use
of middle classness as identity and alibi, it has become a much more

widespread ingredient in an expanding politics of meritocracy. Another
part of the Tamil Brahmin defense against Non- Brahminism has in-

volved the resort to bodily meta phors that recycle the caste essential-

isms of the colonial period. We see an early instance of this in 1919. In
response to non- Brahmin opposition, Brahmin nationalists sought to

reclaim the mantle of leadership by throwing into question non-
Brahmin po liti cal capacity. Writing in the nationalist newspaper _New_

_India_ in 1919, lawyer G. Annaji Rao warned that such challenges would

lead to po liti cal decline. The Brahmin was best suited to lead, he ar-

gued, because of “his religion, training, and tradition.” By contrast, Rao

warned, non- Brahmin rule through which “the common soldier, the

man in the street, the man with perhaps more sinews than brains,”
would assume leadership would bring about “rebellion” and “war.” [57]


-----

CHALLENGING HIERARCHIES OF VALUE IN MADRAS 107

This distinction between sinews and brains, or the manual and the
mental, has become a common feature of a defensive Tamil Brahmin
and upper- caste politics.

German Tutelage

It was in the context of sharpening Brahmin– non- Brahmin tensions

that IIT Madras was founded. In 1956, Prime Minister Jawaharlal
Nehru, while on an official visit to West Germany, was offered assistance to establish a higher technological institute in India. West
German chancellor Konrad Adenauer also promised one hundred scholarships for Indian students wanting to study in Germany. During
their interaction, Nehru gave Adenauer a copy of India’s second Five
Year Plan, in response to which Adenauer cautioned that “while undoubtedly it was good to have gigantic plants, concentration on these

alone would leave a vacuum.” Adenauer pointed out that “ffty percent

of German technicians were drawn from small- scale industries and

even handicrafts” and “offered German technical help to India not only
in the feld of big and medium scale industries, but also in that of small-
scale industries.” [58]

The frst Indo- German Agreement was signed in Bonn in 1959 for

the establishment of an Indian Institute of Technology at Madras. As
part of the deal, the Government of Madras granted 633 acres of reserve
forestland to the Government of India on which to site the new institute. The agreement provided for the ser vices of German professors and

foremen, training facilities for Indian faculty members, and a supply
of scientifc and technical equipment for the establishment of the central workshop and laboratories. The frst batch of German professors
and technical experts arrived in 1959. In the late 1960s, there were still

twenty German professors and fve experts remaining at the institute.
In addition to their role in teaching and curriculum development, laboratory development, workshop training, and joint seminars, a large
number of German experts visited the institute individually and in dele ga tions to exchange ideas, establish research cooperation, and con-

duct seminars. A number of faculty, technical staff, and students from
the institute also visited German universities for practical training and
career development. German involvement formally ended in 1973.


-----

108 THE CASTE OF MERIT

The early collaboration with West Germany continues to be ac-

tively commemorated as a key part of the institute’s history. IIT Madras
opened its Heritage Center in March 2006 to showcase the institute’s
founding and work. Here, the Indo- German partnership is on graphic

display in photo graphs and newspaper articles. Many of the articles are

from the two main English- language newspapers in the region, _The_

_Hindu_ and _The Indian Express,_ which followed the Indo- German

collaboration with avid interest. The year before the institute’s founding,
_The Hindu_ carried an article noting that “for several years German
industry has, to a considerable extent, been called upon for the realization of the great Indian development proj ects and that it is ready to

continue to take a share in them.” [59] _The Indian Express_ also did its
part in publicizing West Germany’s contribution to establishing a
“center of excellence” in Madras and its generous offer of scholarships
to travel to Germany for study. [60] Between them, the two papers kept
in circulation information that they deemed most newsworthy to
their anglophone readers.

The photo graphs and quotations speak to the signifcance of the col-

laboration for both sides. German president Heinrich Luebke laid the
institute’s foundation stone and unveiled a tablet symbolizing Indo-
German cooperation in 1962. Quoting Mohandas Gandhi, Luebke announced the ambition of the partnership as one of making knowledge
“the common property of the people.” Not to be left out, former West

German president Theodor Heuss, who visited the institute in 1960,
chimed in from a distance that the collaboration “should certainly
bring about a development and revival of the technical abilities of the
Indian people.” [61] Herr von Heyden, West German chargé d’affaires at

New Delhi, offered a more pointed observation about “the engineer,”
who, he noted, “was a responsible person and every professional action

of his had human and social consequences because he was instru-

mental in creating a new society and evolving a new economic order
and new physical environment.” [62]

Indian dignitaries, too, offered accolades. S. Radhakrishnan, presi-

dent of India, appreciated the institute as “a vis i ble demonstration of

German friendship for India.” Humayun Kabir, union minister for sci-

entifc research and cultural affairs, described it as “one of the fnest
examples of co- operation among the nations of the world in the pur-


-----

CHALLENGING HIERARCHIES OF VALUE IN MADRAS 109

suit of science and technology” and registered his confdence that “the
German professors and experts would lay down the traditions of the
institution on sound and progressive lines and give it the thoroughness
and efficiency, which characterized scientifc and technical education
in Germany.” Kabir pointedly expressed his hope that the German experts “in giving practical training to students would help in raising
the standard of the cultivation of manual skill of the students, which
was almost neglected in their education.” [63]

This chorus of appreciation from Indian and German dignitaries

signaled the status of IIT Madras as an emblem of the new India, where
world- class expertise would be developed in the ser vice of nation-

building. German tutelage was deemed necessary but only as a catalyst to jump- start technological and social development. Indian offi-

cials like Kabir were clear about the contributions of German expertise:

it was the practical orientation of German engineering that India needed
most. For their part, West Germans were eager to participate in this

endeavor as a way of leveraging development expertise in the ser vice

of Cold War diplomacy. It helped that unlike with Britain, Indo- German

relations were not bogged down by a shared imperial past. It was easier

to pre sent this collaboration as an equal partnership of two nations

that harked back to German- Indian interactions before World War II.

Germany has long occupied a unique place in the Indian develop-

mental imagination. From the late nineteenth century, intellectual col-

laborations between Indians and Germans shaped a sphere of ex-

change extending beyond the bound aries of the British Empire. German

economic nationalism, particularly the work of Friedrich List, had a
profound infuence on Indian anticolonial thought. From the 1880s,
List’s critique of classical po liti cal economy informed Indian nation-

alist critiques of British rule and imaginaries of development. [64] Indo-
German intellectual exchanges also extended into physics, philosophy,
psy chol ogy, and art. The life histories of Indians who went to Germany

to study beginning in the 1920s illuminate the fuzzy boundary between academics and politics. Engineering students were no excep-

tion. A case in point are the stories of Brajesh Singh and Tayab Shaikh,
two engineering students in Berlin, who “soon abandoned their studies
completely in order to work exclusively in M. N. Roy’s communist
group.” [65]


-----

110 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Many of the Indian students who went to study science and tech-

nology in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s drew inspiration from
German understandings of the relationship between science, state, and
society. They developed their model of a nationalist science from the
Germans, combining fundamental research with industrial development. Within British India, Germany rose in prominence as nationalist

advocacy for science shifted from a 1920s emphasis on theoretical research to an increasing focus by the 1940s on applied and industrial
science.

Elevating a German scientifc model for national uplift was not

simply an Indian inclination. Germans, too, made science a central
plank of national self- defnition and international relations. In the early

twentieth century, German cultural diplomacy was self- consciously

oriented around the spread of intellectual institutions. This was even
more the case between the world wars. Just days after signing the ar-

mistice that ended World War I, Max Planck addressed the plenary session of the Prus sian Acad emy of Sciences with these words: “If the

enemy has taken from our fatherland all defense and power, . . . there

is one thing which no foreign or domestic enemy has yet taken from

us: that is the position which German science occupies in the world.” [66]
This sense of comparative advantage was echoed by Fritz Haber of the
Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes in Berlin, who argued that although the war
meant that Germans “no longer sit on the board of directors of the
world . . . scientifcally we believe we can still be numbered with those

67
peoples which have a claim to be reckoned among the leading nations.” Especially in the context of a League of Nations boycott of
German scholars between 1919 and 1924, science became the stage for
demonstrating German leadership. During this period and until 1934,

Germany showcased its “scientifc internationalism” by going out of

its way to invite visitors from the United States, Eastern Eu rope, and

Asia. The intellectual and po liti cal traffic between India and Germany

was arrested only with the rise of Adolf Hitler, although it lived on in
part through Nazi support for Subhas Chandra Bose’s Indian National
Army. [68]

German involvement in India resumed more fully in the early

1950s. Scholars have argued that the Cold War in the Third World can
be understood as a competition over the best model of modernization. [69]


-----

CHALLENGING HIERARCHIES OF VALUE IN MADRAS 111

American modernization theory crafted in the 1950s offered a combination of anticommunism, liberal notions of pro gress, and development

aid to decolonizing countries. West Germany’s version highlighted its
own recent experience with war and reconstruction. It was living proof
that development assistance from the cap i tal ist world could rapidly

take a society from devastation to economic and social health.

West Germany’s developmental work in the Third World was also

very much a part of its own postwar self- fashioning as a peaceful,

altruistic nation. Moreover, foregrounding the technical aspects of
development assistance helped West Germany defne itself as “an inde pen dent nation despite its strategic dependence on the United States.”

Through a focus on “ ‘hard and honest’ work, on achievement and

efficiency, and on high quality,” West Germany promoted its developmental diplomacy as a nonpo liti cal, nonideological “Third Way,” dis-

tinct from both U.S. and Soviet agendas. The demonstration of technical
prowess, it was hoped, would help the country “[claim] a spot among
the former colonial powers in the postcolonial scramble for markets
and infuence.” [70]

West German involvement in India’s post- independence develop-

ment dovetailed with India’s own emerging focus on rapid industrialization. During the period of India’s Second Five Year Plan (1956–1961),
India received 14 percent of all West German development aid. Two

West German proj ects in India— the Rourkela Steel Plant and the coop-

erative district proj ect in Mandi— represented distinct models of top-

down industrialization and bottom-up agrarian reform, respectively. [71]

IIT Madras was the third. How did this third proj ect unfold, and

what were its effects? Indian scientists and planners in the 1950s con-

tinuously raised the question of how to balance the need for foreign
collaboration with the aspiration to national self- sufficiency. Signif-

cantly, many of them were themselves trained in Western countries,

which only reinforced their conviction that this balance was pos si ble.

A case in point was Meghnad Saha, who did part of his training in Germany in the 1920s. In his work on the Indian Planning Commission,
Saha underscored the danger of international collaboration leading to
technological dependence. Speaking to the Indian Parliament about the
work of German engineers at the Rourkela Steel Plant in the 1950s, he
argued in favor of “engag[ing] a number of Indians of promise and ability


-----

112 THE CASTE OF MERIT

to act as assistants to these Germans, in every phase of their work, so

that when we wish to go for our next million ton iron and steel plant,
we can do the planning and designing entirely with our own men, and
we do not have to depend upon foreign technicians any further.” [72] The
“Indianization” of science needed to be a priority to ensure a future

“technical autonomy.” [73]

When he inaugurated IIT Madras in 1959, Humayun Kabir explic-

itly compared it with Rourkela. Even more valuable than the help given
by West Germany in the erection of the Rourkela Steel Plant, Kabir argued, was the assistance in establishing IIT Madras, “ because it would

enable India to train successive generations of technologists and scientists, who would constitute the country’s man- power, which was its

greatest asset.” As did West German developmental outreach, Kabir
singled out the country for its postwar recovery. The Germans, he
stated, were “known for their genius,” as seen in the rebuilding of their

economy to the point where “West Germany today was among the

leading countries of the world in science, technology, industry, and in
every feld of human activity.” [74]

West Germany’s technical advocacy is evident in IIT Madras’s early

approach to pedagogy. More so than at the other IITs, German infuence resulted in a curriculum “heavi ly focused on practical training

in manual skills such as blacksmithing and woodworking.” [75] On a 1961
visit to the campus, a group of MIT professors noted the German insistence “that six months of the frst year and three months of the

76
second year of undergraduate training be devoted to workshop practice.” The showcasing of technique as a unique West German talent
is in clear evidence in the IIT Madras Heritage Center, where a number
of displays depict the importance of workshop learning in the early
years of the institute. One display in par tic u lar is worthy of further

description. Under the heading “Workshops” appears the following

summary:

The report of the Prof. August Ruker Technical Mission (23rd
November 1956) observed: “Since a broad introduction to practical
work in India was of great importance in a country yet to get indus-

trialized, the Institute should provide compulsory workshop training
to the students in special workshops to be set up for the purpose.”
Accordingly, the visiting German experts left no stone unturned to


-----

CHALLENGING HIERARCHIES OF VALUE IN MADRAS 113

equip the workshops, which were one of the very frst buildings to

come up in the campus with the latest and the best machines, instruments and other experimental facilities. A large number of Indian experts and technicians collaborated in this task of establishing
a “hands-on” culture among the students in their learning pro cess.

The Central Workshop, both from the points of view of its training
programme and its potentiality for fabricating sophisticated engineering equipment, was acclaimed as the best of its kind in the
country.

To drive home the importance of this “ ‘hands-on’ culture,” a photo-

graph appears below the text of Walter Scheel, minister of economic
cooperation of the FRG, demonstrating his carpentry skills to then IIT
Madras director B. Sengupto, who looks on with a somewhat bemused
smile.

How did West Germans perceive Indian responses to technical

training? We know from work on German involvement in Rourkela
that the West German technologists sent to set up the steel plant found

77
much at fault with Indian attitudes. They saw many of Rourkela’s problems as the result of “the lack of a modern work ethic among the Indians.” They complained that “Indian workers were unwilling to

take charge and neither understood the value of labor per se nor showed

the required professional ambition.” The West Germans reached the
conclusion that if Indians “did not internalize the value of industrial
work, Rourkela’s production would never reach the projected output
and India’s industrialization would remain a dream.” [78]

At times, these criticisms took on a more blatantly colonial, even

civilizational tone. West Germans perceived their tutelage not simply
as technical but as an education in values. The FRG’s development aid
policies in 1957 argued for a focus on “educational tasks in the widest
sense,” especially on “education toward sensible economic conduct.” [79]

This was echoed by a 1961 expert advisory board, which maintained
that “if one wants economic development aid to succeed, one has to
remodel those people’s thinking through patient, tedious training.”

One of the most pointed remarks came from Walter Scheel, the
carpenter- diplomat we met earlier, who expressed his conviction that

foreign capital investment would only bear fruit if Third World societies internalized “the importance of work and craftwork, the value of


-----

114 THE CASTE OF MERIT

the individual . . . and dynamic thinking instead of static- feudalistic

ways of living.” [80]

These West German perceptions of their Indian trainees echo earlier

British colonial rhe toric on Indian technical capacity. Like the British

before them, the West Germans were frustrated by dismissiveness

toward “craftwork,” but interpreted this as an Indian rather than a
caste- specifc characteristic. Unlike the British who reinforced caste

in practice even as they decried it rhetorically, the Germans were more

insistent on the need to link the industrialization of society to the
modernization of the individual. In this they echoed the expectations
of 1950s and 1960s modernization theory that, with exposure to the
modern workplace, traditional identities and practices would give way
to individuated subjects making rational choices. For the Germans, the
modern workplace was transformative not just because of its social dy-

namics. As a space of modern techniques, it would re orient the indi-

vidual mentally by remaking his body.

�

Non- Brahminism and Dravidianism, together with German tutelage,

issued multiple challenges to the role of modern technical education
in entrenching caste hierarchies. While the former suffused the
Tamil public sphere, the latter was contained within an institutional
setting consciously set apart from the wider universe of regional education. Non- Brahminism and Dravidianism elevated the standing of

the non- Brahmin collective. German tutelage emphasized the

modern individual as the site of embodied technical knowledge. Both
sat uneasily with existing hierarchies of value that placed upper over
lower caste. Chapter 4 turns to the reception of these frameworks by

the frst cohorts of IIT Madras. As we will see there and in subsequent

chapters, the terms of debate set in play by Non- Brahminism, Dravidi-

anism, and German tutelage— region versus nation, mental versus

manual, lower caste versus upper caste— have lived on in IITian narra-

tives and claims to merit. We will also see the reverberations across

national and transnational arenas of a defensive Tamil Brahmin politics of meritocracy. Let us turn now from the broader currents of social transformation we have explored in this chapter to the life histories of IIT Madras’s earliest alumni.


-----

#### IIT Madras’s 1960s Generation

W e have seen that the vast majority of colonial- era engineers were

from upper- caste backgrounds. Although many disdained manual

labor, they embraced engineering because it was a white- collar profes-

sion whose status was enhanced by its relationship to conceptual
knowledge and the colonial state. In Madras Presidency, upper castes,
and Brahmins especially, were all the more amenable to engineering

because the Madras College of Engineering curriculum was weighted
in favor of theoretical knowledge and because the college offered a fast

track to the civil ser vices, a privileged site of professional belonging.

The founding of the IITs reinforced the institutional stratifcation

set in place during the colonial period. They were intended to be the

cream of Indian higher education, set apart from both industrial schools
and regional engineering colleges. Caste served as both social structure and meta phor to render future IITians exceptional. As upper

castes, they were meant to embody the Brahminical spirit of learning

and be the builders of the new nation.

These trends were called into question by Non- Brahminism, Dra-

vidianism, and German tutelage. Non- Brahminism challenged the hi-

erarchies of value that placed Brahmin over non- Brahmin. German tute-

lage elevated practical knowledge as foundational to industrial society
and the modern individual. How did these competing frameworks

115


-----

116 THE CASTE OF MERIT

inform the making of Madras IITians? How did they come to see
themselves as engineers, as nation- builders, and as upper castes?

The Institute’s 1960s Alumni

The story of John Abraham, a 1969 alumnus who was an avid chronicler of IIT life, best exemplifes West German infuence on the making
of the 1960s IITian. [1] The trajectory of Abraham’s life also illuminates
the shifting ambitions of the IITs and of IITians. From being emblematic of the German- trained IITian in the 1960s, he soon became an

anomaly. Abraham’s shift in status is intimately linked to the changing
fortunes of the German model as the early emphasis on practical
training and jobs in “core engineering” was supplanted by a turn to
more “conceptual” branches, such as computer science, and to careers

in management, fnance, and information technology. As a lifelong mechanical engineer in India, Abraham thus represents a path not taken,
one oriented around the leveraging of technical expertise for national
development.

In other ways, however, Abraham had much in common with other

IITians. He was from an elite Syrian Christian family of English-

educated professionals. Syrian Christians are a high- status Christian

community in Kerala, considered to be on par with Hindu Nairs in the
caste hierarchy. In the eigh teenth and nineteenth centuries, they fol-

lowed strict caste rules of purity and pollution and were part of the

court culture of the native state of Travancore. Not only was Abraham
from a high- status and affluent family, growing up in the 1960s, but

he thought of himself as a nationalist subject whose technical training
at the IITs placed him in an elite category of engineers called to a higher
purpose. Moreover, he identifed and continues to identify strongly as
an IITian, an expression of institutional kinship that is the basis of
both affective and material investment.

Despite these commonalities, Abraham diverged from other IITians

in his sustained investment in the German model of nation- and self-

making through hands-on engineering. He was also critical of the caste
sensibilities of his peers, which he saw as inimical to productive labor.

Abraham’s similarities to and differences from his peers help to mark


-----

IIT MADRAS S 1960S GENERATION 117

shifts in career trajectories and sensibilities in a particularly illumi-

nating way.

Here I use Abraham’s story to frame the narratives of 1960s IIT

Madras alumni. I showcase the life histories of twenty alumni, including Abraham, who attended the institute over the de cade. Some are

life histories that I recorded; others come from the 2008 volume _Refec-_

_tions by IITians,_ compiled by Ram Krishnaswamy, an IIT Madras 1970
alumnus. These are supplemented by contemporaneous documents

from the 1960s collected in a volume titled _Campaschimes: IITM_
_through IITian eyes._ All the life histories are retrospective constructions of personal and professional lives that are mediated by the events
and experiences of the intervening forty- odd years. As a combination of

memory and reinvention, they offer a win dow onto life history as a nar-

rative pro cess of subject formation. In my analy sis, I treat these accounts

as true memories that speak both to the past and to the context of their
enunciation in the late 2000s. They are also practices of self- fashioning

through which IITians narrate themselves in relation to gender, caste,
nation, and state.

The chapter begins with an account of the caste backgrounds of

early IITians. Most came from urbanized, professional families. Many
followed family members into engineering. In this sense, the IITs were

spaces of caste and class homogeneity as well as professional reproduction. These narratives point to a discrepancy between alumni from

families in the national civil ser vices, who had an early awareness of

the IITs, and those more frmly embedded within a regional milieu.

But as I go on to show, for all 1960s IITians, the time at the institute
was one of nationalization. No matter their background, most came

to understand themselves as exceptional because of their link to state

and nation. At the same time, to be the cream of national education
was to also be world- class, an orientation that soon led to paths beyond

both public sector and nation and beyond hands-on engineering. Despite German infuence, the conceptual gradually emerged once again
as distinct from, and superior to, the practical, and more ftting for
those inhabiting the highest tier of technical training. Now, however,
it was expressed through a disavowal of the state and an embrace of
diasporic and private sector trajectories.


-----

118 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Signifcantly, there is also an active disavowal of caste across most

of the narratives. Unlike during the colonial period, when caste was
openly embraced as the basis of modern national identity and leadership, 1960s IITians almost uniformly claim a form of post- caste sub-

jectivity. Some even contrast the 1960s as a time of castelessness to the
2000s, when they perceive caste as having resurged and infltrated the
IITs. By contrast to this other wise shared account, Tamil Brahmins

stand out for their explicit self- marking as a caste and for their por-

trayal of IIT Madras as a national refuge in a context of regional caste
hostilities. This, I will show, is due to the regional po liti cal milieu in

which their marking as caste subjects foreclosed the claim to castelessness. As I elaborate in later chapters, the willingness of Tamil Brah-

mins to mark themselves in caste terms and to read their own and the
institute’s exceptional standing in relation to caste politics was an
impor tant precursor to what would become a more widespread national

and transnational politics of meritocracy.

This chapter is a bridge between the preceding analyses of colonial

and early postcolonial institutional and po liti cal histories and the fol-

lowing ethnographic accounts of making merit at the IITs. In looking
at the experiences and perspectives of the 1960s generation of Madras
IITians, I hope to throw into sharper relief the changes that followed
with the expansion of the reservation system, exam coaching, and diasporic mobility.

_Region and Nation_

Abraham attended IIT Madras (IITM) from 1964 to 1969. His schooling
was representative of the elite anglophone social profle of many early
alumni. He was a gradu ate of La Martiniere Boys’ College in Lucknow,

one of India’s oldest and most elite schools. He fnished his schooling
with the Se nior Cambridge examination and then took the IIT entrance

examination in Kerala. In this, he followed in the footsteps of his
brother, an alumnus of IIT Kharagpur’s second cohort. At the time, the
IIT exam and admissions were conducted on a regional, or zonal, basis,

and Abraham emerged as a front- runner for the southern zone. He ad-

mitted to having an “unfair advantage” taking the exam in Kerala,
where the “pre- university standards were so miserably low that nobody

who studied in Kerala could ever possibly dream of getting into IIT. . . .

IIT MADRAS S 1960S GENERATION 119

The only Malayalis who would get into the system were those who

studied in convent schools in Madras or in even more elite institutions
like La Martiniere.” By laying out the landscape of regional education
in these terms, Abraham set himself apart as both socially elite and

supraregional in orientation. [2]

Like Abraham, most students admitted to IIT Madras in the 1960s

came from upper- caste backgrounds and went to one of two kinds of

schools: private, English- medium schools, most often run by Catholic

orders, or central government schools catering to the children of cen-

tral government ser vices personnel. For the frst group, the discovery

of IIT Madras was somewhat accidental. Although they were from pro-

fessional families with histories of education, they were also frmly

rooted in the wider southern region. The choice of IIT Madras over one
of the other regional engineering colleges was by no means a given. As
we saw in Chapter 3, the College of Engineering, Guindy was the
southern region’s premier technical institution and would have been
the better- known choice for an engineering degree.

Balachandran, a 1969 alumnus, was in this frst category of stu-

dents. A Keralite from Chennai, he attended St. Mary’s school and got
to know about the IITs after getting into Madras’s Loyola College for

his pre- university course. He told me that it was a “bit of a default”

that he attended IIT Madras at all. [3] “In ’63, ’64, IITs were not all that

well known,” he explained. “It was because of a couple of friends of

mine who were writing the exam that I got to know about IIT. Other-

wise the option generally was Guindy. And there were a few other op-

tions, like the PSG College at Coimbatore and Coimbatore Institute of
Technology.”

A number of alumni had fathers or other family members who had

studied engineering at Guindy. Paul, a 1966 alumnus, had attended
St. Bede’s school for boys in Chennai and had a close connection to both
engineering and Guindy. Paul’s father and two elder brothers were me-

chanical engineers. In addition, his father was a gradu ate and then prin-

cipal of Guindy. For Paul, the choice of engineering was a no- brainer.

Like his brothers before him, his idea “was to enter a good engineering

institution— either Guindy or one of the big three in Coimbatore (PSG,

CIT, or GCT) and to follow my engineering dream.” But his plans to
attend a regional engineering college were derailed by a friend who


-----

120 THE CASTE OF MERIT

alerted him to “the existence of the IITs and also that there was one

IIT literally on our doorstep.” The friend told Paul that the chances of
admission were slim, since “approximately 100,000 youngsters were

expected to sit for the 1st Joint Entrance Exam.” This challenge appealed to him, and he de cided to try his hand at the exam. When word

came of his admission and se lection for the Mechanical Engineering

branch, he found himself at a crossroads. Because of its exalted status

in his family, Paul accepted the invitation to appear for an interview

at Guindy but ended up deciding on IIT Madras just a few days before
the interview. It was a difficult decision because at the time, he “did

not realize the numbers of doors and opportunities that would open
due to that one decision.” [4]

Similarly, Rajesh Vedula, a Telugu Brahmin from the very frst IITM

cohort, came from a family of engineers. His three brothers are engi-

neers with lifelong careers in academia. One is the director of technical

education in Andhra Pradesh, another is a professor of electronics at
the Madras Institute of Technology, and the third is a professor and
head of the Department of Aeronautics at the Indian Institute of Science. Engineering was a veritable family business. But Vedula’s fate was

sealed even more decisively by a family tragedy. His eldest brother had

been a gold medalist from Guindy, where he studied from 1937 to 1941.
However, a bright future was cut short by his sudden death in August

1941. When Vedula was born just over a year later, in December 1942,

he was given his brother’s name. As his namesake, he felt morally

obliged to continue his legacy. Even so, Vedula ultimately de cided to

attend IIT Madras and not Guindy, his brother’s alma mater. When I

asked him why, he paused and then recalled feeling “excitement about
getting into these new institutes of higher technology that were sup-

posed to have high standing compared to even Guindy.” [5]

For some, choosing the IITs over Guindy provoked intergenerational

battles. Krishnaswamy, a 1970 alumnus from the Andaman Islands,
found himself in the favorable position of having gotten admission into
both IIT Madras and Guindy. Although his choice was the IIT, he had
to fght his father, whose verdict was “Good: No IIT, BIT, CIT and no

hostel life, just go to Guindy Engineering College.” His father “believed

IIT was the same as CPT— Central Poly Technique or MIT [Madras In-

stitute of Technology],” which gave an “AMIE [associate member of


-----

IIT MADRAS S 1960S GENERATION 121

the Institution of Engineers] Diploma in Engineering.” [6] It took a visit
to IIT Madras’s impressive campus and conversations with students
and faculty to convince him other wise.

For Mathew, a 1969 Syrian Christian alumnus, the intergenerational

battle was with his mother. His father, “a qualifed Industrial Chemist,

had told [him] about the IITs and given [him] a booklet with fve years’
Mathew took the IIT entrance examination in 1964 at St. Joseph’s College in Tiruchirapally, “where entrance exam question papers.” [7]
generations of [his] family had studied before [him].” Much to his

mother’s chagrin, Mathew got admission. She implored him not to go
away “when there [was] an ITI [industrial training institute]” right

there in their town. Mathew ended his narrative with the wry observation that “ ‘Brand IIT’ may now be a universally recognized one, but

obviously was not known so well among the denizens of this backwater
region in those days!” [8]

The relative obscurity of “institutions of national importance” and

preeminence of regional institutions was a common tale for the frst
group of 1960s alumni embedded within the southern educational ecosystem. However, this did not apply to the second set: the children of

employees in the central government ser vices. These were students

who were already extraregional in outlook and experience. They spoke

other languages, had pan- Indian itineraries as a result of parental em-

ployment, and studied in central government schools or national private schools. As a result of this national orientation, they were among

the frst to hear about the IITs and avail themselves of the opportunity
to study there.

An example was Vijayaraj, a 1969 alumnus. Vijayaraj went to one

of the Sainik Schools, which were administered by and for the Indian

Army. His father was an army man and principal of his school. Much

of Vijayaraj’s mobile social world—he had spent his life moving across
northern cities— consisted of other families in the central ser vices. In

fact, it was one of his father’s engineer friends in the central ser vices

who told him about the IITs. [9]

Similarly, Baliga, another 1969 alumnus, came to know about the

IITs through his father’s networks. His father was about as entrenched

in the national engineering ser vice as one could be. He had been the

frst chief engineer at All- India Radio, then chairman and managing


-----

director of Bharat Electronics Ltd., and f nally founder of the Institute

of Telecommunications Engineers. This was a family with a social

network and a worldview that was more attuned to the IITs as fedgling national institutions than to the regionally based system of
education. [10]

Among these students with parents in the central government ser-

vices, many were diasporic Tamil Brahmins from northern metropo-

lises like Delhi and Bombay, whose families had been part of colonial
and postcolonial bureaucracies. Several from Delhi had attended the
Delhi Tamil Education Association higher secondary schools. Popularly known as Madrasi schools, these are private, government- aided

schools that cater specifcally to the Tamil diaspora. As upper castes
whose families had sought employment elsewhere to escape the politics of Non- Brahminism, many of them were also resolutely antire-

gional. One Madrasi alumnus, Thyagarajan, narrated a life history
that ft a typical pattern of Tamil Brahmin mobility. His grand father

was a landlord and _kanakkupillai,_ or revenue collector, in a village in
Madras Presidency’s Thanjavur district. Over the course of a generation, four of his fve male children migrated to Delhi, and the remaining

son took on the role of _kanakkupillai._ In Delhi, the four sons “followed
the family tradition” and fnished college degrees in accounting.

Thyagarajan’s father went on to government jobs in the postal ser vice

and then in the Indian Agricultural Research Institute. He described his
Delhi world as a mini- Madras of Tamil Brahmins with a Tamil Sangam

(Society), a Carnatic music association, and a Bhajan Sangam. It was also

one that became intimately linked to the IITs; from Thyagarajan’s school
cohort alone, fourteen students were admitted to IIT Madras. [11]

Madrasi schools were among the most highly regarded in Delhi,

where word of the IITs caught on especially early. Sri Kumar, a 1968
IITM alumnus, recalled forty years hence that “every one” from his

Madrasi school was taking the JEE. Madrasi students did not lack in
self- regard derived from a sense of urban cosmopolitanism as Delhi-

ites. Iswaran, another Madrasi school product and 1969 IITM alumnus,
conveyed this in self- mocking terms. “When I frst came to IIT Ma-

dras,” he confessed, “I was full of myself. After all, I was the gradu ate

of the prestigious DTEA (Madrasi) Higher Secondary School . . . and


-----

IIT MADRAS S 1960S GENERATION 123

I was moving from the cosmopolitan capital of India to a relatively hick
town in South India.” [12]

We see from these early accounts that, in the 1960s, alumni came

with dif fer ent senses of belonging. While most were upper- caste Hindus

or Christians from family histories of higher education, only a minority

had a pan- Indian sensibility that came from being members of an in-

ternal diaspora of civil servants. Still, IIT Madras had a leavening effect that produced an overall re orientation from region to nation. It was

an education not just in engineering but in a new hierarchy of value,
in which the region and its institutions paled in comparison. Being an
elite engineer with an IIT pedigree meant being a national one. The
growing divide between regional and national education confrmed
Nazir Ahmed’s fears about the IIT system’s exclusivity and isolation
from the wider world of Indian engineering. As we will see in subse-

quent chapters, this divide further widened in later de cades with

IITians’ departure both from engineering and from India.

It was no accident that students became national subjects over their

years on campus. As we saw in Chapter 2, the IITs were established

with this specifc purpose in mind. The exceptionalism of the IIT
system was embodied in its transcendence of regional education and
its ambition of producing a national cadre of engineers. This sense of
collective purpose— even destiny— was consciously cultivated through

official annual rituals of commencement and matriculation, at which
visiting dignitaries reinforced the IITs’ hallowed standing. The nationalism of the time was also intimately linked to science and socialism.
As Mathew put it, “In those idealistic times the frst fush of in de pen-

dence still lingered and most educated Indians were inspired by

Gandhian thought and Nehruvian socialism. Like them, I was eager

to acquire ‘the scientifc temper.’ ” [13] The affective link to the state and

its proj ects was by no means limited to IIT Madras. Sandipan Deb notes

that before weekly flm screenings at IIT Kharagpur, students had to
watch a government- sponsored documentary that proclaimed the IITs

to be “Nehru’s dream.” [14]

In alumni memories of campus life, national affiliation comes

through powerfully as a defning feature of the IIT experience. Hardly
anyone failed to mention the melting pot experience of IIT Madras,


-----

124 THE CASTE OF MERIT

where one met students “from Kanyakumari to Kashmir.” [15] Vedula
attributed this sense of cohesiveness to the frst of IITM’s directors,
B. Sengupto. “The director really promoted the national integration of

16
all the students,” he recalled. “He essentially wanted to make IIT Madras the technological Shantiniketan.” Others, like Iswaran, put it

in less hallowed terms that perfectly captures the propensity for regional stereotyping: “I had never laid eyes on a Jew before, nor had I
ever met a Sardarji who spoke En glish fuently. Add to this, a Sindhi

who spoke better Tamil than I did and a sprinkling of UP walas (whom
I had always thought of as dumber than a bag of rocks) who knew more
mathe matics than I did. Fi nally throw in a Golti who carried his own

toilet paper! I was totally fabbergasted and humbled within a matter

of days.” [17]

The resort to poetry was a common one in those days and refected

the enduring infuence of British- style education in elite anglophone

schools. One 1962 poet encapsulated regional diversity in a poem titled “Impressions,” which ended with a lament about the workload at
IIT Madras:

Delhi: Concrete structures, bustling streets.
Kerala: Communists and calm retreats.
Gujarat: Gandhi caps and millionaires.
Maharashtra: Marine drive and Western airs.
Orissa: Gushing Mahanadi, foods and blushing belles.
Nagaland: Recesses, Ravines and Rowdy Rebels.
Andhra: Mangoes, Mica, Charminar.
Punjab: Akali Dal and Chandigarh.
Mysore: Coffee, spices, Chamundi Hills.
Bengal: Classicists and mundane mills.
Jammu & Kashmir: Lakes, house boats, eternal snow.

Assam: Oil rigs and the rare rhino.
Uttar Pradesh: The moonlit Taj Mahal and the laughing hyena.
Madras: Gopurams, natyams, the famed Marina.
Rajasthan: Pseudo tiger- hunts, deserts, durbars.

Bihar: Unsung source of fragrant cigars.
Madhya Pradesh: Desperate dacoits and manganese.
IIT: Periodicals and constant ‘D’s. [18]

_Caste and Class_

Much of the commentary on social differences faithfully echoed statist
discourse about unity in diversity. Even when pushed to consider other
differences, most alumni only fagged them in the most anodyne terms.
“ There were some variations,” Balachandran admitted. “Maybe some

could speak En glish more fuently, others could not speak En glish that

fuently. That would have been the only difference. Some people might

have known how to eat with a fork and a spoon, some people would

not have known how to eat with a fork, but they picked up in no time.
Some people liked fsh curry and rice, some people liked sambar and

payasam.”

Sometimes the denial of meaningful differences was more vehe-

ment. “ There were no social divisions,” Balachandran insisted em-

phatically. “Nobody said, for example, that you are a Keralite, or that
you are a north Indian, and you are a Brahmin, you are a . . . no, no-

body looked at whether you are a Brahmin or a Scheduled Caste or

what ever. I mean, it was immaterial. People ate from the same plate,

they drank from the same glass, they would sleep in the same bed
sometimes.” Signifcantly, he contrasted what he experienced as a more
egalitarian time with the 2000s. There had been a “societal change”

in caste consciousness, he brooded, that had even “infected” IIT Madras. “In 1996, 32 years later, my son got into IIT Madras,” Balachandran

continued,

The dormitories were overcrowded so they were placing two students

to a room. My son had to share it with another Keralite, and when
we went in and put in his baggage, the parent and the other boy also
came. My wife and I were quite surprised. We don’t carry a, what you

might call a family name. We don’t say we are a Menon or we are an

Iyengar or Parmar. We had dropped all that by that time. The other
family was quite worried, and f nally they couldn’t contain them-

selves, and they asked my wife, “Are you all Scheduled Caste?”
because the other boy was a Brahmin.

Balachandran and his wife proceeded to tell the other parents that his
wife’s parents were from the royal family of Cochin, “and that kind of

seemed to reassure them.” The whole exchange made him “very sad

because that was a question we never would have asked.” When I asked


-----

126 THE CASTE OF MERIT

to what he attributed this change, he replied, “I would say to a large
extent it could be awareness, but the po liti cal direction that it took and

the po liti cal climate, with more emphasis on reservations . . . and of

course some people are just hung up about these things.”

Balachandran’s perception of caste divisions as evidence of a more

recent politicization of caste, and his emphasis on reservation as the
root cause, is a common upper- caste tale. It speaks to the comfortable

inhabitation of an unmarked upper- caste category in the early postin-

de pen dence years, especially within elite spaces like the IITs. At IIT

Madras, the insulation from regional caste politics offered by central
government education added to this feeling of castelessness. For
Balachandran, being an IITian in the 1960s simply meant being a
modern national subject who had transcended the unseemly social divisions of Indian life. This was made pos si ble by the near absence of

anyone who was explic itly marked as lower caste. In contrast to the

anxious query by his son’s roommate’s parent, the unthinking assumption in his day was that your peers were all upper castes like you. It

was such a naturalized fact of inhabiting an institution of national excellence that it hardly needed stating.

While Balachandran denied the salience of caste in his day, he did

acknowledge class differences, although he insisted that even these ul-

timately did not matter. “I knew many boys who were from middle

class families or lower middle class families who got in,” he recalled,

“and they were living on scholarships.” He continued:

Many of them have done exceptionally well. They were bright, very

bright, and it had nothing to do with your father’s standing, or the

earning capacity of your parents or wealth in your family. That may

have given you better exposure at that point of time. To that extent,
yes, when you came in you did have an advantage. In terms of the
exposure that you had already had, you could participate in things like

debates, you could speak En glish more fuently, so to that extent. . . .

But as far as the curriculum was concerned, you had to just have the
brains. That’s all.

With this distinction between “exposure” and “brains,” or nurture and
nature, Balachandran insisted that the 1960s IITian was best defned
by natu ral talent and not social background.


-----

IIT MADRAS S 1960S GENERATION 127

For others, however, wealth differences weren’t quite so inconse-

quential to either academic ability or social standing on campus. Sev-

eral 1960s alumni mentioned classmates from industrialist and other
well- to-do families who stood out because of their wealth and sophis-

tication. Several were also “toppers” in classes. I asked Vijayaraj whether

there was a way of describing the toppers so cio log i cally, to which he

replied without hesitation, “Yeah, they were mostly from rich families.”

The most common indicators of wealth were fa cil i ty with En glish and

access to luxury goods. Of such goods, the most con spic u ous was the

car. Vijayaraj made a point of mentioning that his two wealthiest
classmates both had fancy cars. One from Chennai would spend his
weekends at home. “ Every weekend, a Mercedes used to come and pick

him up,” he recollected. The other was also from a local family. “IIT is

a big campus,” Vijayaraj explained, “so to go from the hostel, we had
bicycles. But this guy, frst he had a motorbike, and soon, by the second
year he had a Mazda car, one of those small matchbox cars. Mazda car,

a Japa nese car, in those days he had a Mazda car! And he had a stereo,

so his room was always full of friends because all these goodies were

there.” Such luxuries, especially a foreign car, were rare at that time of

protectionist tariffs and became notable markers of status.

Even for IITians who regarded wealth differences as consequential,

class was a form of social hierarchy that effaced rather than provoked
considerations of caste. In part, this was because caste differences were

largely absent or hidden at IIT Madras, with its overwhelmingly upper-
caste faculty and student body. Even after the implementation of res-

ervation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SCs and STs)—
those occupying the lowest rung of the governmental schedule of
castes—in 1973, the demographic weight of upper castes and the extreme marginalization of SC and ST students translated as the nonconsideration of the caste question.

The illegibility of caste was further reinforced by IITians from lower

middle class and rural backgrounds, whose stories worked to neutralize
caste as a form of capital. Dasigi, a 1966 Brahmin alumnus from Orissa,
is an example of someone who described himself as an outlier in class
terms. His father had joined the Bengal- Nagpur Railway as a railway

guard on a monthly salary of sixty rupees. However, this did not prevent him from living his dream through his sons. Even before Dasigi


-----

128 THE CASTE OF MERIT

started school, his father was telling him about IIT Kharagpur. It is

only when recounting the admission interview that the father’s social

network comes into view. At the interview to determine his campus
and feld, his father “met one of his contemporaries from college days.

They recognized each other and exchanged pleasantries.” The friend
turned out to be a professor at IIT Madras, who advised Dasigi to choose
metallurgical engineering, “since the steel industry was offering great

employment opportunities.” [19] This was a new beginning for the family.

“Once I was in IITM with fnancial support, the entire family learned

more about getting into IITs. Three years later my younger brother got

into IITM (Aeronautical Engineering) and he got his scholarship based
on his per for mance at the entrance examination itself. In 1967, a cousin

of mine got into IITM (Mechanical Engineering). In 1982 another
cousin joined IITM (Computer Science) and the greatest plea sure was

when my brother’s son got into IITM (Civil Engineering) in 1997!” [20]

Dasigi’s narrative is revealing both for what it says and for what it

does not say. By his account, his family succeeded against the odds in

producing fve IITians. What are mentioned, but in terms that do not
unsettle the dominant narrative of class disadvantages, are the structural conditions for this favorable outcome: the fact that his father was

an upper- caste college gradu ate who had a government job and profes-

sional friends. Unlike paternal perseverance and individual grit, these

forms of caste capital are presented as mere happenstance and not attributed real causal force.

There is a similar absence of caste in the story of Shenoy, a 1965

Brahmin alumnus. Like Dasigi, Shenoy was raised outside India’s major
metropolitan centers in Bantwal, “a minor trading town on the banks
of Netravati, 25 km from Mangalore.” He recounted “boyhood thrills
of seeing our roads asphalted for the frst time (1953) and the coming of
electricity (1957).” [21] As with Dasigi, Shenoy talked of his arrival at IIT
Madras as a minor miracle. He had studied in the regional language,
Kannada, until he completed his School Leaving Certifcate examina-

tion, at which point he moved to St. Aloysius College, where En glish

was the medium of instruction. The move was profoundly unsettling.
At Aloysius College, he “found it difficult to ask a question, because

of [his] inability and shyness to speak in En glish.” [22] He had to master

a new language, learn new subjects, and get accustomed to a new en-

IIT MADRAS S 1960S GENERATION 129

vironment after having been schooled in a village. The adjustments

were so overwhelming that he almost dropped out and returned home,
but he ended up staying and getting ranked ninth statewide in the Pre-
University Exam. This was his ticket to IIT Madras, which he had
heard about from his “classmate Janardhan Baliga from Bantwal, who
knew a little more about the outside world than [he] did.” Shenoy came

away from this experience with an appreciation for the power of English education. When he became an employee of Conoco, the American oil and gas com pany, he started Bantwal’s frst En glish medium

school. Despite this, he notes regretfully, “for the next 46 years there

have been none from this town who went to IITs.” [23]

In these narratives, we see a foregrounding of personal and profes-

sional ambition— one might even call it an ideology of individual des-

tiny. Class is a form of social disability that is heroically overcome by
a combination of family support and individual intellect. These are sto-

ries of self- actualization. What is much less apparent is the relation-

ship between individual achievement and caste networks. This is even
more striking given how much families _do_ fgure in the narratives. The
combination of presence and absence conveys an impression of family

and community as interpersonal but not structural, which is reinforced
by the silence around caste. The vast majority of IITians privileged
nation and sometimes class as forms of collectivity while vociferously disavowing caste and casteism. Their sense of themselves as
technical moderns whose merit was earned and deserved simply did
not allow for the possibility that caste was a factor either structurally

or affectively.

There was, however, one set of students who _were_ willing to talk

about caste: Tamil Brahmins. However, they did so not to mark their
own inherited capital but for the opposite purpose. They had opted to
take the IIT exam to bypass a set of educational barriers: regional
quotas for lower castes. At IIT Madras, these were mostly less affluent

Tamil Brahmins who came from histories of education but were not

part of the nationally oriented set of central government employees.
Kalyanaraman, a 1966 Tamil Brahmin alumnus, conveyed this perspective most clearly. He made a point of distinguishing himself from his
more urbane, non- Brahmin classmates. “I didn’t study in any of the

convent schools or other schools,” he emphasized. “Up to SSLC, I


-----

130 THE CASTE OF MERIT

studied in Tamil medium.” [24] His father had been an electrical engi-

neer with the Tamilnadu Electricity Board, and he had done most of
his schooling outside Chennai in Vellore’s Sri Venkateswara High
School and Madurai’s American College. “Most of the people that you

see here today, from my generation at least, are all ordinary, middle

class people from educated families,” he noted. “That was the only cri-

terion: we thought education was impor tant.”

The “we” Kalyanaraman was referring to were Tamil Brahmins.

When I asked him whether people knew about the IITs in the 1960s,

he replied, “ People at large did not, but my father was an engineer, he’s

from an engineering college. He got a gold medal from a government
engineering college.”

“Guindy?” I asked.
“Yes, Guindy Engineering College,” Kalyanaraman replied.
“So, why did he send you to IIT? Why not Guindy?” I persisted.
“ Because Guindy wouldn’t give me a seat, because I’m Brahmin. So,

IIT was the only ave nue for us all.”

Despite the fact that many of his Tamil Brahmin counter parts were

more affluent urbanites, like the students of Madrasi schools, Kalyanaraman chose to group himself with them and in contradistinction to
other non- Brahmin elites. For him, Tamil Brahmins were by defni-

tion “ordinary, middle- class people” who prioritized education but

were unfairly denied access to regional institutions. Moreover, Kalyanaraman faulted Dravidian politics for this recent change, which affected
his generation in a way that it had not affected his father’s.

As mentioned in the Introduction, anthropologists Chris Fuller and

Haripriya Narasimhan offer a sustained analy sis of the mutual consti-

tution of Tamil Brahminness and middle classness. [25] In their 2014 book

_Tamil Brahmans: The Making of a Middle-_ _Class Caste,_ they show in

exhaustive detail that the Tamil Brahmin transformation into a middle

class has every thing to do with the forms of caste- based capital— land

owner ship, ritual purity, literacy— that they are able to leverage. They

also point out that Tamil Brahmins express a sense of being middle

class in two key ways. First, by transmuting “their caste’s traditional
value of ascetical self- restraint— symbolized by vegetarianism . . . into

the modern, middle- class virtues of self- discipline and moderation.” [26]

Second, through a claim to intellectual superiority and educational

attainment, which marks a departure from older claims to ritual purity
as the basis of elevated status. Despite such evidence, Fuller and Narasimhan come to the conclusion that Tamil Brahmin “social stability

27
is not primarily caused by persisting caste privilege, but by class reproduction operating within a modern society and economy.”

My own analy sis builds on theirs but shows that rather than class

supplanting caste as the primary mechanism of social reproduction,
the two are inextricably linked. [28] The distinction between class and
caste is belied by their structural and affective entanglements. For instance, Dasigi’s and Shenoy’s stories show how prevalent ave nues into

the middle class are for Brahmins because of the institutional and so-

cial caste networks that allow for mobility. Moreover, the power ful dis-

cursive trope of Brahmin intellectual superiority continues to suffuse
the most lucrative sectors of the Indian economy— most clearly infor-

mation technology— and creates unique opportunities for less affluent

upper castes. For instance, Super 30 at the Ramanujan School of Mathematics, an IIT- JEE coaching institute, aims to discover the next Srini-

vasa Ramanujan, a poor Tamil Brahmin autodidact reputed to be one
of the greatest mathematical minds of all time. Caste continues to be
a power ful index of value that channels affective and material invest-

ment to shape class formation. Fi nally, as we see from Kalyanaraman’s

account, the intimacy between class and caste is a pervasive theme in
Tamil Brahmin self- representation. For him, class is an identity that

works discursively to efface the advantages of caste and transform
Tamil Brahminness from the product of accumulated literacy, education, and professional advancement into a disability. In the pro cess,

lower- caste politics is faulted for denying Tamil Brahmins their rights,

while upper casteness is made into a power- neutral form of identity.

What is less clear is whether this claim to a middle- class identity

through the effacing of historical advantages is a retrospective move
on Kalyanaraman’s part or one that had equal resonance in the 1960s.
It may well have been the case that Kalyanaraman opted for the IITs
to bypass the regional reservation system; this does not mean that he
had _then_ the strong sense of being middle class that he has _now._ As

we will see in Chapter 7, this sense of Tamil Brahminness as a middle-

class identity frmly associated with meritocracy has only strengthened over time. Not only has it gotten stronger for Tamil Brahmins,

132 THE CASTE OF MERIT

but it has informed an expanded politics through which IITians as a
whole have come to defne themselves in more explic itly identitarian

terms in opposition to lower- caste rights.

_The_ _Mental and the Manual_

Whereas Tamil Brahmin alumni were the most explicit about their

caste identities, others echoed ideologies of caste through remarks

about intelligence. This is where the distinction between the mental

and the manual and the assumption that conceptual ability is the true
mea sure of merit come back into view. Even before the JEE coalesced

into a nationally celebrated examination, with its fetishized ranking
system, IITians had an obsessive need to rank one another. Before the
JEE began in 1961, students were selected on the basis of their standing

in high school as toppers. The advent of the exam only reinforced this
sense of intellectual worth.

When they arrived on campus, however, many students found their

sense of self- worth upended by the presence of “genius.” They were

“now in a dif fer ent league.” Across cohorts, the stories of peer bril-

liance abound. “ Here, there were geniuses,” Vijayaraj told me. “They

didn’t study for the exam. They’d just come, and before the exam they

spent time teaching others. This was unbelievable. You wouldn’t be-

lieve it unless you experienced it. That’s the kind of people who were

there. And in every class, there were three or four.”

Very often, alumni compared these peer geniuses and their in- born

capability with the mediocre faculty. As Vijayaraj put it, “Most of the
lecturers were just ordinary. It was the brilliance of your classmates

that made the experience so special.” Some faculty came in for stronger
derision. Nageshwar, a 1964 alumnus, noted that “Mr. V. S. Kumar (Humanities) reminisced at the reunion (35th) that before his frst lecture
to us, he was gripped by fear and awe at facing the assemblage of brains
in front of him!” [29]

There is a near consensus across cohorts that they learned more

outside the classroom through interaction with their brilliant peers
than from teachers in the classroom. Kalyanaraman drew this comparison most sharply by referring to an incident with his Tamil Brahmin
classmate, Shankar. “In one of the physics classes when he started
asking some questions the lecturer said, Shankar, I think you know


-----

IIT MADRAS S 1960S GENERATION 133

more than me. Can you take the class? He just challenged him. And
Shankar came and took the class.” Signifcantly, none of the stories of
“genius” had to do with technical prowess. Almost all featured forms
of conceptual or theoretical mastery long associated with being upper
caste. How did these evaluations of relative intelligence intersect

with the German insistence on hands-on technique?

All the IITs had a workshop requirement for practical training. San-

dipan Deb points to the workshop as a key distinction between the
IITs and MIT. “The IIT student was also to spend far more time on
practical training than at MIT,” he writes. Unlike at MIT, IITians
“would actually have to fle, forge and weld metal” and “sweat through
hundreds of hours of this.” [30]

At IIT Madras, the German connection further enhanced this em-

phasis on the practical dimensions of engineering. Abraham recalled
that all the laboratories were headed by Germans, who tried to instill

in their students the value of practical work. Not just the students, they
also insisted that professors and faculty associated with a lab should
have their offices on the premises rather than in a separate academic
building. This, Abraham remarked wryly, “was in contrast to our traditional attitude of isolating practical work which is typically perceived
as inferior to intellectual activity!”

Like his German mentors, Abraham relished lab work. “Contrary

to the opinion of a great majority of my contemporaries,” he attested,

“my verdict is that we had a damn good curriculum, provided one was
seeking a career in hardcore engineering. Since that was true in my

case, I took my workshop and drawing and lab exercises quite seriously,
and of course my fnal year proj ect. I think the facilities we had with

regard to lab equipment, library, classrooms, hostels and so on were

excellent, at least for our country at the time. I doubt whether any

single German university had the full range of facilities and departments which we enjoyed.” Abraham’s aspiration to be a “hardcore” engineer made him an outlier. His focus on the content of an IIT education rather than on the status of the IITs as “institutions of national
importance” came out of what he characterized as his “natu ral af-

fnity” for mechanical engineering. “Right from childhood days,” he
recalled, “I worked with mechanics and was fascinated by it, by
building things . . . opening up alarm clocks, that type of thing.”


-----

134 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Thinking back to his choice of vocation, he noted, “It must have been
the sight of a steam locomotive puffing steam and spewing smoke that
frst triggered my fascination for the career path which I ultimately fol-

lowed.” He also attributed it to the historical moment. “A small boy
growing up in the 1950s was likely to encounter a variety of mechanical devices and contraptions ranging from clocks to road rollers to exercise his curiosity,” he pointed out. This was a very dif fer ent time

from the pre sent, when external stimulus for children “may be quite

substantially restricted to pixel arrays on a display screen of some
kind.”

When I asked him why he chose IIT Madras, he said it was because

his brother’s experience at IIT Kharagpur had attracted him to German

training. “Even in Kharagpur there were some German professors,” he

explained, “and my brother got a scholarship to go to Germany.” His

brother’s positive experience with Germans sealed the deal for Abraham.
He opted for IIT Madras because, as he saw it, West German infuence

meant a stronger mechanical engineering curriculum.

Abraham singled out his German professors as particularly inspi-

rational. “One German professor,” he recollected, “taught me turbo
machines. . . . I think I picked up half my engineering knowledge in . . .

those lectures. The way he expressed things, the way he drew diagrams,

I found absolutely fascinating. Although he had a funny accent and
mostly the students would make fun of him, I made it a point to really

take him very seriously. And that infuenced me a lot. . . . Even among

the Indian professors, those who had the Indian industrial experience,

I could notice the difference in their approach.” Abraham’s time in
the IIT classroom eventually led him out of academia. This was
because, as he put it, “ those [faculty] who had industrial experience,

they made the subject come alive.” Those who “possessed only text-

book knowledge . . . their lectures lacked life and liveliness.”

But by all accounts, the German emphasis on valuing practical

knowledge had mixed results. Most students experienced workshop activity as an encounter with the unknown. A 1970 gradu ate who be-

came the additional director- general of police and the chairman and

managing director of Karnataka State Police Housing Corporation recounted to Deb “the shock of the frst metal workshop.” In their very
frst week, they were taken to the tooling workshop and told to fle


-----

IIT MADRAS S 1960S GENERATION 135

down an iron cube. “Most of us fled away the rust and took the piece
to the instructor who laughed at us,” he recalled. “He told us what we
were in for: we had to fle a full three inches off! It was raw physical
work in extremely hot and humid conditions. Those tender hands that

all of us had come to IIT with turned callused and tough overnight.” [31]
Another alumnus was more pointed about the cultural dissonance that
the workshop requirement produced. “The rigorous workshop training,”
he explained, “was naturally a sore point with most of the students, for
obvious reasons rooted in the traditional structure of Indian society.” [32]
While some rationalized their aversion to practical training through
oblique references to caste, others defended this side of their education—

not through caste critique but by invoking the conception of the engineer as a combination of the mental and the manual. As one alumnus

put it,

Some die- hards, the forever unsatisfed set of wise- guys, indignantly

point out the absolutely impractical point of view involved in having
a rigid workshop programme, devoid of almost all engineering values
for the ever suffering frst year students. They insist we aren’t going

to become workmen and vehemently condemn anything that calls
for a test of brawns coupled with brains. They would rather specialize
in the brains department—of course, whether they _can_ or _cannot_ is

quite immaterial. And here’s where they make their biggest slip. For

after all, a workman knows _how,_ a theoretical man knows _why,_ but
a good engineer should know the How _and_ the Why. [33]

During the frst year, students were divided into four groups— A,

B, C, and D— with A and B and C and D alternating between weeks

devoted to theory and workshop. Abraham, who was in group A, recalled how “over the hostel mess tables, C and D listened to our horror

tales of what was in store for them [in the workshop]. . . . The half- day

on Saturday was a blessed relief, just three hours of drawing preceded
by Maths. . . . I think most of the students deeply resented the emphasis

on workshop skills.” By Abraham’s assessment, he was one of a small
minority that saw practical training as integral to the pro cess of be-

coming an engineer. In an essay for the IIT alumni magazine, he staged
a debate with another 1960s Madras IITian, who expressed his strong
objection to the required amount of practical training. “When I refect


-----

136 THE CASTE OF MERIT

on our extraordinary emphasis on ‘practical training’ in terms of ftting, carpentry etc.,” he wrote, “I seriously question the usefulness of

that type of practical training. When there is so much to learn in such

a limited time, our time would have been better utilized in learning

about the theories under lying engineering princi ples. Since the prac-

tical training emphasis was suggested, and perhaps even imposed by
the Germans, it was never even questioned.” [34] Abraham responded
with the following: “This is prob ably the most prevalent view among

IITM alumni, and seems to refect the ‘brahminical’ attitude of our
educated elite towards practical skills, whichever community we may

belong to. I hold a diametrically opposite view, because in my experi-

ence, those who get into IIT are mostly from the privileged or affluent

sections, whose motivation is not to take up engineering but to make
it good in life by any means.” [35]

How did Abraham arrive at this heterodox stance? His time in Ger-

many, where he spent a year on an internship, was formative. He was
struck by how German diploma programs to train engineers for industry were valued equally with university research programs for

future academics. He was also highly impressed by the pace of postwar
reconstruction, which he attributed to German grit and technical effciency. Abraham received his training at the head office of one of the
biggest mechanical engineering companies in Germany. “Socially also,
I found it very in ter est ing,” he recalled, “ because it was a factory which

had been absolutely fattened at the end of the Second World War.
Because they were making armaments, like all the big concerns, of

course, were doing. So, they had built it back brick by brick and then

a lot of people, handicapped people, with one arm missing, one leg

missing . . . they brought this thing back, and the kind of pride it

took . . . that old generation was still there.”

German appreciation for practical knowledge was most visibly on

display in the workshops. So, too, was the pejorative assessment of
Indians. “They were used to Indians coming occasionally as trainees

from other organ izations,” Abraham pointed out, “so, I found that there

was already a bias against Indians, in the sense that they had already
got the impression that Indians are people who don’t like to do any

work. So, I had to prove myself. Once I showed that I was interested,
then I found that they really opened up. Because, other wise they said


-----

IIT MADRAS S 1960S GENERATION 137

that, you people have this lofty attitude, and that we don’t lift our

fn gers.”

Abraham dwelt at length on one episode that captured for him the

difference between German and elite Indian attitudes toward physical

labor. “A couple of times, you know, I was ashamed,” he confessed.

I was in the workshops, I used to wear overalls and I would be put
with a team of people, assembling things. . . . I had to go to dif fer ent

stations, assembling these big diesel engines. . . . I was there just as

a trainee. [The trainer] asked me to pick up something that was under

a workbench with a lot of things piled up under neath. It was a fairly

heavy item. I tried to reach it; I couldn’t get it. So I told him I can’t

get it. He didn’t say a word. He just got down on the foor, crawled

under neath the bench and pulled it out and I felt really ashamed of

myself. He set an example for me like that, because I was supposed

to be taking instructions from him. He never said a word.

For Abraham, this wasn’t simply a one- off; it was emblematic of

racial difference. “I started observing the disciplined way in which the
bulk of them work,” he said emphatically.

By and large the attitude to work, how carefully you assem ble a whole

series of things. You fnish one by one. They would line it up neatly

at the end of the table. Our tendency is, you know, okay you fnish

one you throw it there, you throw it there. . . . But, you know, the

sense of discipline, which was inculcated prob ably due to the war, the

period of war, after the war, what ever it is, but basically they are a

disciplined race. I could see those things. And that goes into all their

thinking, in their design, in the systematic way they do it. All these

things fascinated me.

Abraham’s sense of shame in the face of German competence and

his desire to emulate what he saw as national racial discipline demands
further analy sis. On the one hand, he leveraged German technique to

advance a critique of Indian upper- caste assumptions about the supe-

riority of intellectual over manual labor. On the other hand, he was in

thrall to the civilizational logic that elevates Western industry over
Eastern indolence. Paradoxically, Abraham rejected caste hierarchy
only to back into an ac cep tance of racial hierarchy. Signifcantly, his


-----

138 THE CASTE OF MERIT

admiration for German technique was not even tempered by the politics of the war; not once in all of Abraham’s appreciative remarks about
Germany did Nazism receive any mention. Even as he refected on
German technique as national racial talent, the po liti cal did not

intrude.

Abraham may have been a minority, but he was not alone in his

frustrations with the prevalent attitude in the IITs toward practical

training. Raghavan, a 1960s alumnus, was also exasperated with the
privileging of theory by many of the faculty. He had “always been very
‘hands-on’ and had spent the previous years in high school making and
fying model airplanes.” Getting into the Aeronautical Engineering
branch at IIT Madras was “the ultimate dream.” But, he recalled, it was
a “huge letdown” from the very frst lecture. “The instructor walked
into the classroom, went straight to the blackboard and started drawing
curly brackets with i, j, and k sprinkled here and there.” Raghavan

waited to be told “what all this had to do with Aircraft Design.” [36] He
never found out because the course was limited to Set Theory. By the

third year, Raghavan was fed up and de cided to start a rocket club with

some classmates, but their “grandiose plans for a multi- stage rocket”

were thwarted by the faculty discovering their secret lab. [37]

Raghavan went on to a job with the Oil and Natu ral Gas Corpora-

tion’s Bombay Offshore proj ect. “ There was no way this was going to

be theoretical,” he remembers thinking. On his frst assignment, he
was put in charge of maintenance on an offshore oil drilling rig. “I was
literally ‘At Sea!’ ” he bemoaned. “They assumed I knew every thing just

because of my engineering degrees! This was a job for a Real Engineer,
not me. My mechanic essentially told me how to do my job.” [38] Raghavan
returned to academia a year later for an advanced degree in the United

States at the Georgia Institute of Technology. At an interview with his
future adviser, he was complimented on his level of analytical competence and asked if he had “ever worked on something practical and actually built any piece of hardware.” When Raghavan admitted that he
had, his adviser “burst out with a spontaneous response, ‘Aha! A Practical Hindu!’ ” and then went on to explain that “he had met numerous

Indians who were very good at theory but had no good practical feel

for things.” [39] We see here an echo of the pejorative colonial assessment


-----

IIT MADRAS S 1960S GENERATION 139

of upper- caste practical skill, although in the U.S. diaspora the speci-

fcity of caste is obscured by a generic conception of the impractical
Hindu.

_Masculinity_

We might think of the privileging of theory and intellectual one-
upmanship that pervades the IITs in terms of a culture of upper- caste,

homosocial masculinity. The IITs are overwhelmingly male campuses;
the percentage of women has never exceeded ten. On campus, students

experience an extended period of intense male sociality, a four- year

ritual of collective bonding out of which they emerge as IITians. It even
comes with a soundtrack, a specifc IIT slang through which these in-

group, fraternal relations are expressed and cemented. [40]

But the forms of male bonding forged on campus are predated by

another key set of male relationships within the family. As mentioned

earlier, many alumni had male engineers in their families, whether

these were fathers, brothers, or uncles. Even for those who did not per-

sonally choose engineering as a desirable feld, going into the technical

sciences was a by- product of male example and pressure.

The relationship between sons and fathers is a thread that runs

through all the narratives. Many alumni whose fathers were engineers

recounted their choice of the IITs as an extension of these relationships.

For some, entering the IITs was the realization of paternal aspirations.
For others, it was simply the only choice imaginable. For all of them,

fathers were a critical point of reference in forging their own paths as

men and as professionals.

Dasigi’s is the story with the most reverential attitude to “the

father,” who is the all- sacrifcing elder deferring his dreams to the next

generation. For some, like Paul, the order is reversed. His father is an

example to emulate but one that remains beyond reach. He refers to
his father as “a born engineer” who “enjoyed getting involved with en-

gineering issues of all types.” By contrast, Paul confesses, he was “not
a born engineer,” but “being brought up in a home like ours, one
couldn’t think of any other profession as a future career.” [41]

Baliga’s father also looms large but in a slightly dif fer ent way. Un-

like Paul, for whom engineering was a default option, Baliga shared his


-----

140 THE CASTE OF MERIT

father’s passion for electrical engineering and wanted to follow in his
footsteps. But he wanted to do so without using his father’s “consider-

able infuence.” The IIT exam was a way to prove that he could gain
admission to a prestigious institution without his father having to pull

strings. Because he was ranked in the top ffty on the JEE exam, Baliga

was able to choose any branch at any campus. Instead of exercising an
in de pen dent choice, he “dutifully” consulted his father, who, “to [his]

chagrin . . . promptly stated ‘Mechanical Engineering.’ ” What followed

was a mixed blessing. Baliga recounts that “fortunately, during my entrance interview at IIT- M, the panel chairman stated ‘You must want

to join the Electrical Engineering curriculum because of your father’s

background,’ to which I immediately replied ‘yes.’ ” [42] Despite his ini-

tial gesture of in de pen dence, then, Baliga was only able to follow his

chosen track because of his father.

For Vijayaraj, the son of an army man, engineering was a kind of

masculine middle ground. His younger brother was his father’s heir:

he had gone to the National Defense Acad emy and become a decorated

lieutenant general. “But I was not so well on the physical side,” Vijayaraj
told me, and so he was unable to continue the patrilineal tradition of
army ser vice. In any case, his heart was in teaching mathe matics.

However, his father’s derision when told about his choice— “You want

to become just a _vathiyar_ [teacher]?”— made him opt for engineering,

which, even if not sufficiently “manly,” was at least more lucrative.

Through these narratives, we see the father as the exemplar, the

dreamer, the motivator, or the authoritarian. By contrast to the sometimes adversarial but always motivating relationship with fathers,

mothers— when they appear at all— play quite a dif fer ent role. They are

nurturers but ones that inadvertently inhibit ambition. Mathew’s story
about his mother, who preferred that he attend an industrial school at

home than move away to IIT Madras, is a case in point. Similarly,
Krishnaswamy talked about his mother expecting the worst from the

IIT exam and “quietly preparing me for the rude shock and sweet
talking me into studying B.Sc. Physics at Vivekananda College; closer
to home in Mylapore was the appeal.” [43] When considered together,
these narratives convey the sense that if left up to mothers, those who

are destined for excellence would sink into mediocrity.


-----

IIT MADRAS S 1960S GENERATION 141

These early, formative relationships with fathers set the stage for

the peer relationships that followed at IIT Madras. Almost to a person,
alumni idealize these campus friendships. It is clear that for many,

these bonds of institutional kinship lasted a lifetime. The innumerable tales of quirky personalities, slapstick escapades, and mutual support both while at IIT and after are suffused with admiration and

competition in equal mea sure. In some ways, this combative intimacy

is a predictable outcome of campus life. But for IITians, there is the

added dimension of feeling like the chosen ones. The ties that bind are
not simply personal; they shore up a sense of collective destiny.

_State and Public Sector_

For 1960s alumni, this sense of upper- caste, masculine destiny was rein-

forced by a link to the state. It is easy to forget from today’s vantage

point, after economic liberalization and the information technology

boom, that the IITs began as institutions more aligned with the older,
late colonial model of producing technical expertise for public sector engineering. While they were always endowed with an exceptional world-

class status that arguably oriented them more outward than inward, this
did not mean a total disavowal of the state. The experiences of IIT
Madras alumni from the frst de cade of the institute’s history reveal an

identifcation with the state that has fractured in the de cades since.

Sometimes the connection to the state was fostered through mili-

tarism. The frst two cohorts of IIT Madras students graduated together
in 1964 because the 1962 Sino- Indian border confict had made war pre-

paredness a new state imperative. The Indian government wanted to
quickly produce more engineers who could be pressed into military-
related technical work. As the institute’s 1962–1963 annual report
states, “The unprovoked aggression by China on our Northern borders
posed a grim challenge to the country and institutions like the IIT Madras. We are happy to rec ord that the Institute, in its own humble way,

rose to the occasion gamely. National Cadet Corps training was made
compulsory for certain years of the B. Tech degree course so as to ensure disciplined military training to the youth in the context of the
Chinese menace. The Five Year Degree course was accelerated in order
to turn out more engineers in response to the call of the country.” [44]


-----

142 THE CASTE OF MERIT

K. Narayanan, an alumnus from the second cohort, noted in a newspaper interview that their syllabus “was rushed through and the fnal
examinations were conducted in December 1964.” N. R. Dave, one of

Narayanan’s batch- mates, added that “due to this, we were called the

‘emergency’ batch.” [45]

For some, the relationship to military ser vice continued after grad-

uation. Narayanan, who graduated as a chemical engineer, joined Indian Oil’s Guwahati Refnery in 1965, when the Indo- Pakistan War was

just beginning. “The engineers at the refnery had to go on night patrolling,” he recalled. “During the day, we received military training.
They wanted to train us to be able to defend the refnery.” [46] Others like

Ramiah, a 1967 alumnus, signed up for military ser vice. Although

“many companies like En glish Electric, Larson and Toubro, Tata etc.

came for se lection,” he with his “patriotic ardor” was “captivated by

the terrifc lecture given by Squadron Leader Thambi and especially
when he referred to the heroic deed of the IAF [Indian Air Force] pi lot

who smashed his burning plane into the Sargodha radar station in the
’65 Ops.” Swayed by Thambi’s tales of daredevil patriotism, Ramiah
ended up enlisting with the Indian Air Force. [47]

For the most part, however, IIT alumni from the 1960s sustained

their link to the state through civilian rather than military ser vice.

Over their college years, students were sent for training to public sector

enterprises, like the Durgapur, Rourkela, and Bhilai steel plants and
National Metallurgical Laboratories. Some went to public- private part-

nerships, such as Tata Steel, that were most emblematic of nationalist

development. These periods of training often led to job offers, as it did

for Dasigi, who “was offered a scholarship of Rs. 150 per month and a job
at Rourkela Steel Plant after graduation.” [48] Other Madras IITians began

their professional lives in public sector enterprises where engineering as
nation- building was a core dimension of their work. And many of them

did so after a period of practical training in West Germany.

In this sense, Abraham was very much aligned with his peers. Al-

though his time in Germany gave him a lasting appreciation for all
things German, it only motivated his return to India. When he returned
after his year’s sojourn, he chose a position in Utkal Machineries, one
of the Larson & Toubro group of companies, because of its German

partners. Utkal Machineries was in Orissa, and it supplied heavy ma-


-----

IIT MADRAS S 1960S GENERATION 143

chinery for steel plants, mining, and paper industries, including for the
nearby Rourkela Steel Plant. “It was really my cup of tea,” Abraham

remembered. “I mean, I really got into it, because I not only knew

German, I knew German standards. I still have most of my textbooks
in German. I found them more systematic than the British and American textbooks. So I found that quite fascinating. I was there for ten

years at that frst job.”

Despite this early orientation around the developmental state and

its public sector enterprises, reinforced by German training, many
alumni still conveyed their sense of being a unique breed of employee.
To the extent that they entertained the option of government ser vices,

only the central, not the regional, government tier was deemed worthy.
For several, like Sri Kumar and Raghavan, this amounted to following
in their fathers’ footsteps. Sri Kumar, who joined the Indian Police Ser-

vice, characterized this choice as inevitable because he was “the son

of a Central Government servant who spent over three de cades of gov-

ernment ser vice in the Union Public Ser vice Commission.” Similarly,

Raghavan followed his father into the Indian Administrative Ser vice

(IAS). His characterization of the IAS echoed the colonial understanding of the state as an enlightened bureaucracy governing a divided people: “The IAS is the Steel Frame that has to meet the chal-

lenge of holding our nation together. Without this Steel Frame, India
will be like Iraq and Af ghan i stan, with warring factions taking over

control and terrorizing the people.” [49]

For most, however, the initial commitment to the public sector

quickly wore thin. Dasigi found the job at Rourkela “not fulflling” and
got out “soon after completing the ‘bond’ (get trained for one and a half

years and work for a further period of fve years or pay Rupees 10,000
back).” [50] Balachandran put his antipathy toward the public sector

most bluntly: “ Because it’s a bureaucracy . . . as a technical person

there is only so far that you could go. You’re one of so many, so you get

lost in that ocean. Unless you have a godfather in those places you

really can’t move.” For him, the very scale of bureaucracy bred ano-

nymity. Moreover, it worked against the recognition of the IITian’s
innate excellence.

Balachandran compared his summer training in the Bhilai Steel

Plant “where [his] uncle was” with another stint at Union Carbide. He


-----

144 THE CASTE OF MERIT

experienced Bhilai as utterly unmotivating and so stopped going after

ten days. By contrast, he was far more engaged with his work at Union
Carbide. “They took the life out of me,” he said cheerfully. “They made
me work day and night, and gave me a proj ect, made sure that the

proj ect was completed. . . . Every day there was a review. . . . That im-

pressed me. There was some accountability, you know.” It was striking

that Balachandran had not rethought his impression of Union Carbide
even in light of the gas disaster of 1984. The disaster was a case of corporate malfeasance that led to the deaths of thousands and to ongoing
intergenerational harm from the effects of toxicity. Despite glaring evidence that Union Carbide was far from “accountable,” the contrast
with the public sector remained salient for Balachandran well into the
2000s.

Some, however, chose to stay on in the public sector. Vijayaraj

worked at MECON for fourteen years. The reason was telling. He admitted that the only thing that made working there worthwhile was

his boss, who was an IIT Kharagpur gradu ate. “We got along very well,”

he told me. “He was the only guy who gave me [a] promotion in time.
You see, all the idiots, they thought I didn’t deserve it. I used to always

feel I’m in the wrong, I’m a misft. I was frustrated. But this guy taught
me, he would encourage me. That’s why I stayed for 14 years. But he
was another IIT guy. I mean, it required that.”

In many little ways, then, even those IITians who worked in the

civil ser vices or in public sector enterprises managed to convey the im-

pression that they were _in_ but not _of_ the state. In addition to an under-

standing of their own incorruptibility, diligence, and conceptual
prowess, IITians’ sense of exceptionalism derived from an understanding of temporality. Across the interviews, there was a repeated

refrain of the IITs being temporally out of step with the nation. As
Iswaran put it, “It was the right thing at the wrong time. . . . In cre-

ating the IITs, we intended to have top quality people serving in quality

jobs in India. Of course that did not happen because we lacked the eco-

nomic and industrial infrastructure to offer these gradu ates hand-

51
some jobs. They fed to foreign lands and became shining beacons elevating India’s status in the eyes of the world.”

It did not help that the pickings were slim at the time for ambitious

engineers. Several alumni characterized the 1960s as a barren time


-----

IIT MADRAS S 1960S GENERATION 145

with few job prospects. Drawing a contrast with later generations,

Mathew remarked that “a large number of B. Tech grads of those times,

even if they did not want to, had to enroll for postgraduate courses—
M. Techs in IITs, MBA in the fedgling IIMs [Indian Institutes of
Management]—or go abroad. Difficult as it may be to believe now, there

were no readymade jobs waiting for the triple distilled IIT products

of 1969!” [52] Vijayaraj put it more bitterly: “When we graduated in 1969,
life was a bed of thorns. Many did not get any jobs under Pundit Ne-

hru’s socialist economy and there was a great mismatch in supply and

demand in every aspect of the Indian Economy.”

One option was to go for an MBA at the newly founded Indian

Institute of Management in Ahmedabad. Established in 1961, the IIM
quickly emerged as an attractive alternative to a career in core engi-

neering. It allowed IITians to leapfrog over the hands-on labor and

lower pay scales of the engineering profession and into the ranks of
management. A man ag er was less a practitioner than an overseer; he

was the brains and not the brawn behind the operation.

Characteristically, Abraham’s take on management was icono-

clastic. “In my view, what killed the engineering profession as I knew
it,” he stated, “was frst of all the management industry, represented
by the Harvard Business School and its clones the world over. It became
lucrative for people with engineering qualifcations to take up this new

option, and avoid the responsibilities involved in taking technical decisions. This culture was entrenched in our country even in the 1960s.
If you joined an organ ization as a ‘management trainee’ you started on

a higher salary and rose much faster compared to those who were ‘en-

gineer trainees’ and had limited horizons.” Abraham admitted that the

prob lem is structural. “The justifcation, no doubt, is that nobody pays

an engineer,” he lamented, “and we are effectively considered as little

more than skilled workers. That is a failing in our society and our culture, but nobody likes to talk about it, still less try to do anything
about it.” We see here the beginnings of a shift in the po liti cal economy

of value as a result of which public sector engineering, the coveted ambition of the colonial era, was starting to be overshadowed by the
specter of managerialism. Although still a minority trend, by the 1980s,
this turn to management and away from even professional engineering
would become a defning feature of the IIT system.

146 THE CASTE OF MERIT

_Beyond the Nation_

A more common trend was to go abroad, something that I take up at
more length in Chapter 7. Although the numbers who left India rose

steadily after the 1960s, even at that time there were some who headed

out for training, jobs, or higher degrees. Typically, those from IIT Ma-

dras who chose the route of practical training and core engineering
work in the public sector headed to West Germany. Those who sought

postgraduate degrees and a move beyond hands-on work went to the
United States. Over time, traffic to West Germany slowed to a trickle
and then petered out almost entirely while the U.S. diaspora kept increasing in size. These trends were hugely signifcant in re orienting

IITians away from core engineering and the state sector toward private

“knowledge work.”

Usually, the IITians who went to the United States were those who

had the grades to secure university admissions and scholarships. From
1960s alumni accounts, it appears that the IIT name had yet to catch on
across U.S. academia. This is made clear in the comparative experiences
of two 1969 alumni. Baliga, who graduated at the top of his class, “applied to only the top tier universities in the US.” He had disappointing
results. Unfortunately, he recalled, “IITM had not yet established a
reputation among these universities and my request for fnancial aid

was declined.” In July 1969, he opted instead for the Indian Institute
of Science. By a stroke of luck, however, he “received an offer with fnancial aid from Prof. Gandhi at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in
August 1969 because one of the other applicants was unable to join his

group.” By the frst week in September 1969, he was on a plane to Troy,
New York, to do his MS and PhD “ under one of the pioneers in the

semiconductor feld.” [53] Giri, also a 1969 alumnus, had a somewhat
dif fer ent account. He joined an engineering gradu ate program at the

State University of New York along with three other classmates,
“thanks in part to Gursharan Singh Sidhu’s outstanding IITM alumni
legacy he left at SUNY few years earlier.” [54]

Although these two accounts of the IIT’s reputation in the 1960s

United States vary, both convey a clear sense that, from the outset,
alumni understood name recognition as hugely consequential in the
admissions pro cess. As they saw it, institutional reputation mattered

equally if not more than the strength of any one candidate, and therefore needed to be secured and protected. This was well before the emergence of “Brand IIT” as a term. Nonetheless, the cachet of the pedigree was already very much in view.

Among 1960s alumni, there is another matter that generates more

serious differences of opinion: the impact of the U.S. diaspora on India.
The perspectives of Shenoy, Iswaran, and Abraham capture the range
of positions within this debate.

Shenoy lamented the fow of IITians abroad as “development aid

by a poor country to a rich country.” “It is true,” he admitted, “that
occasionally some billionaire IITian will donate a princely sum of 5

to 10 million back to their IIT and we all rejoice. But how many of us
stop to think that if only these IITians had stayed back like Nandan

Nilekani, how many Infosys (not just in IT sectors but also in energy,
steel, petrochemical, Banking etc.) we would have been able to develop?

Even more impor tant, what kind of revolution we could have had to

overthrow today’s unscrupulous po liti cal class?” [55] This early twenty-

frst- century fantasy of India as a smoothly functioning technocracy

manned by IITians is a far cry from the strong state affiliations of the
late colonial and early postcolonial periods. Even while it remains concerned with questions of national development and the privileged role
of the enlightened technocrat, it shows the distance traveled by IITians
in their imaginaries of the state and their relationship to it.

Shenoy also tracked a shift from an earlier concern about the “IIT

brain drain” to its ac cep tance and even embrace. “ After Rajiv Gandhi’s

much quoted statement— a brain drain is better than the brain in the

drain,” he opined, “the continuing exit of knowledge capital did not
worry any planners or politicians. Some even referred to them as brain
banks. They were implying that those who remained could not really

contribute, because of the pathetic conditions in India.” [56] Shenoy, who

did stay behind, was affronted by the assumption that to realize the

true value of an IIT education, the IITian had to go abroad. For him,
this was indicative of the outward orientation of IITians that was there

from the outset. As an alumnus from rural Mangalore who was the
object of urban paternalism, he experienced the closeted existence of
campus life as a kind of suffocating, willful ignorance. “We were iso-

lated from the outside world,” he recalled with some bitterness. “We


-----

148 THE CASTE OF MERIT

led a sheltered life, comfortable in its own way. We even had movies
during the weekends.” This self- enclosed bliss, he continued, produced

bizarre forms of identifcation and disidentifcation:

We never knew about people living in abject poverty in the nearby

village of Taramani, right next to our comfortable quarters. But when
we heard about the suicide of Marilyn Monroe, many of my classmates were devastated. Being a villa ger myself, I never could under-

stand why they were mourning the death of a movie star in a distant

land. I had never heard of her till that time. We knew even less about
the grinding poverty of a signifcant population of India. Rarely did
we discuss the prob lem of India’s poverty. The politics of governing

India did not capture one’s imagination. We were more eager to know

about the luxurious life in the U.S. or Germany than the appalling
living conditions in nearby Velachery. [57]

Shenoy’s caustic assessment resonates with Nazir Ahmed’s warning
about the isolation of the IITs from their social environments. Ahmed
was principally concerned about the IITs standing apart from other
engineering colleges. By the time of Shenoy’s refections in the 2000s,
there was the additional hierarchy of the diasporic over the homeland
IITian. Now, even the homeland IITian was not at the pinnacle of educational stratifcation. In Chapter 7, we will return to the tensions

among alumni produced by this newer hierarchy of value and ask
whether these have signifcantly fractured institutional kinship.

A second perspective was Iswaran’s, who, contra Shenoy, expressed

what is now the most popu lar position on the U.S. IIT diaspora. For

him, “this so- called brain drain worked in India’s favor. The thousands

of IIT alumni who fed to greener pastures outside India were a living

billboard for the superior intellect cultivated and honed by their IIT
education.” Iswaran’s idea of the diasporic IITian as “a living billboard” anticipates the concerted effort that followed in [58] later years at

producing Brand IIT. In Chapter 7, we will explore diasporic migration

and its relationship to branding at more length to showcase continuities and shifts in the operations of institutional kinship. What is
impor tant to note here is that the forms of upper casteness and branding

that became more pronounced and defensive were already pre sent in a

nascent form in the very frst de cade of the institute’s functioning.


-----

IIT MADRAS S 1960S GENERATION 149

Even then, IITians had a clear sense of themselves as marked by an institutional pedigree with potential international cachet.

Fi nally, there is Abraham, for whom the exodus of IITians violated

an implicit social contract with the Indian public. “I think it is only
from some of the early Kharagpur batches that a signifcant number
actually contributed to Indian industry,” he noted bitterly, “but by my
time the best of the lot—in terms of rank— sought greener pastures

abroad with no qualms of conscience at all. The fees we paid were so low

that we effectively got a free education at the tax- payers’ expense.” As

did Shenoy, Abraham saw the aspiration to foreign careers as indicative

of a skewed hierarchy of value. For him, this privileging of the United
States over India was an expression of the IITs’ growing distance from
the German model of industrial engineering. Moreover, it was a betrayal
of the public trust and the duties of citizenship. He took strong issue
with the notion that the symbolic value of Indian success stories abroad
was adequate compensation for the loss of material value at home.

Of all the alumni I interviewed, Abraham was the most stridently

critical in his assessments of the IITs. For him, engineering colleges
should produce engineers who had expertise in the most tangible,
hands-on forms of labor. Abraham’s sense of the continuities and shifts

in the IITs came both out of his own ethical and intellectual mooring,
and out of his enduring link to IIT Madras. In 1984, he returned to IIT
Madras for a master’s degree in science and found the changes in the
institute thoroughly unsettling. “I sort of got put off the whole idea of

technical education altogether,” he confessed, “ because the students

weren’t interested in engineering. For most of them, engineering was
a stepping- stone to a good career, not in engineering.”

He was also unsatisfed by the teaching. “Some of the people who

were teaching me, at the M. Tech. level, some of them, you could see,
were really third rate,” he said. Once again, Germany fgured promi-

nently in his assessment. “Some of them were simply bluffing because

they knew they could get away with it,” Abraham continued. “ There

were people who had good reputations among the students, were con-

sidered knowledgeable, but because I knew German . . . the fellow

takes a textbook and he shows a fgure and he says that this is something, and I can read the caption in German, I know it’s not what he is
talking about, but he can get away with it.”


-----

150 THE CASTE OF MERIT

The decline of standards, as Abraham saw it, had to do with the de-

cline more broadly of the value of engineering. As a result, the IITs
had lost their sense of purpose. He tracked this decline through the
shifting hierarchy of branches within IIT Madras. When the frst IITs
were founded in the 1950s, civil engineering was the most coveted
branch. “ Those days,” he told me, “engineer really meant civil engi-

neer.” With the decline in the aura of the Public Works Department,
mechanical engineering got the edge, with IIT Madras seen as particularly strong in this branch. By the time Abraham arrived at IIT
Madras in 1964, mechanical engineering had also been supplanted by
electrical and electronical engineering, with civil engineering lagging
even further behind. Chemical engineering too was coming up, as

was metallurgy, and these were followed in the 1980s by aeronau-

tical engineering, naval architecture, and f nally computer science.

When Abraham returned in 1984 for his master’s degree, “computer
science was the in thing. The top rankers in the JEE would invariably

opt for it.”

He told me a story that was in circulation at the time. “ There was

this one chap, the JEE topper. When he came for his interview, he asked
for civil [engineering branch,] and the panel was absolutely shocked.
‘Are you sure you want civil? Why do you want civil?’ and they questioned him for quite some time. But he was infuenced by his father

and he was very sure that he wanted civil. And they were quite taken

aback by that.”

Across my interviews with successive cohorts, I heard echoes of the

shifting pecking order of branches from the more practical to the more
conceptual. While most accepted the changing hierarchy of branches
as a natu ral progression correlating to changes in market value,

Abraham remained doggedly opposed to the eclipsing of older felds by
newer ones. Market value, he insisted, was not the same as intellectual value. A case in point was the rise of computer science. “The fnal
nail in the engineering coffin was the computer industry!” he claimed
in an exasperated tone. “As long as computers actually computed—
think Fortran— there was still some hope as the developments were in

the hands of practical people. But after the Computer Science theoreti-

cians took over the feld and introduced C and its successors, computers
started doing every thing other than computing— presumably under


-----

IIT MADRAS S 1960S GENERATION 151

pressure from the business and management world for ‘manipulating
information’ which seems to be the primary activity today.”

Ultimately, for Abraham, the root of the prob lem was money:

Whereas at one time many engineering organ izations were led by real

engineers, today it is mostly people with a fnance background, often

with a B. Tech. or similar qualifcation serving as a decoration. They
can only talk about the bottom line and related jargon, have no patience with failures or delays in this imperfect world, and do not understand that technical skills need to be nurtured and incentivized.
The attitude is that if there is a technical prob lem one can throw

some money at it and get it solved. . . . The other big area is sales and

marketing, where ethics is given the go-by. Someone who can sell an
oversized or unsuitable product to an ill- informed customer gets credit

for a job well done. Maybe that is inevitable in our consumerist society which thrives on promoting waste of all kinds.

�

At the end of Chapter 2, we looked in passing at the 1968 study by sociologists C. Rajagopalan and Jaspal Singh, which analyzed the caste
and class backgrounds of students at a northern IIT to determine
whether the institutions were contributing to social mobility. [59] The au-

thors interviewed 86.5 percent of students admitted in 1966 and found

that as many as 88 percent were from urban areas. Even most of the

8 percent who indicated a rural background were now urban residents.

In terms of caste, most were from Brahmin or trading castes and had

fathers who had gone through some form of higher education, ranging
from college to doctoral and professional degrees. Mothers, too, while

consistently educated at lower levels than their spouses, were never-

theless pedigreed. Another signifcant fnding was about engineering
itself: the study showed that, on average, students had at least two relatives within the wider family circle who were engineers. Last but not

least, the vast majority of students came from the most elite urban
schools that offered En glish medium instruction.

Rajagopalan and Singh’s study resonates strongly with my own,

more qualitative account. Madras IIT’s 1960s alumni largely shared the
social profle of their northern counter parts. They, too, tended to be

urban and English- educated upper castes with professional fathers and


-----

152 THE CASTE OF MERIT

relatives who are engineers. What Rajagopalan and Singh could not
have anticipated, however, were the caste and class challenges to the

exclusivity of the IITs, the infux of groups from lower- caste and lower-

class backgrounds, and the responses from upper castes to the changing
social composition of student bodies.

The next three chapters will consider these transformations and the

maneuvers made to shore up upper- caste exceptionalism. Chapter 5 on

the examination, Chapter 6 on reservation, and Chapter 7 on diasporic
mobility all address the dialectic of lower- caste claims to rights and

upper- caste claims to merit through which a consolidated form of upper

casteness has emerged. As I have already gestured to, we will see how

being middle class became central not only to Tamil Brahmins but in-

creasingly to other upper castes. Arguments about class became a way
to reconcile their ascriptive identities as members of caste groupings
with claims to achievement. With the expansion of quotas for lower
castes, upper- caste IITians coupled assertions of middle- class identity

with arguments about the need to defend formal equality. Alongside
these strategies, diasporic mobility became an impor tant mechanism

of retrenchment away from the pressures of demo cratic change.

Through these maneuvers, IITians constituted upper casteness as the

very embodiment of meritocracy. Let us now turn to the frst instrument
for the making of upper- caste meritocracy: the mass examination.

#### Testing Merit

y the 1970s, the decline of the German model of hands-on engineering was B under way at IIT Madras. The exodus of IITians to the

United States only reinforced this trend. As Germany faded in symbolic value and the United States took its place as a desired destination
for education and employment, IITians shifted away from core engineering jobs in the Indian public sector toward academia, management,

and private sector industry. The expansion of engineering education
from the 1980s, along with the spread of private schools and colleges
in the 1990s, as part of the liberalization of the Indian economy, contributed to the preference for private sector jobs. As new colleges opened
across India and more and more students entered the ranks of engineering, the IITs worked to distinguish themselves as the most conceptual and rigorous of B.Tech programs whose alumni were better

suited to the managerial class and to the most coveted technical felds,
such as computer science.

The labor of distinction owed much to the IITs’ Joint Entrance Ex-

amination (JEE), which, as noted in the Introduction, has become the
single most impor tant emblem of the system’s excellence and exclu-

sivity. Held every year in April, the JEE is a hotly anticipated event.

Since the frst exam in 1961, the number of candidates has grown
steadily, from 12,771 in 1969 to 79,559 in 1990. By 2001, it had reached
147,775, and by 2006, it was 299,087. In 2011, a total of 468,280 students

153

154 THE CASTE OF MERIT

took the exam, with under 3 percent winning admission to the then

ffteen IITs. [1] These dramatically low percentages only reinforce the

prestige of the examination, setting in motion a vicious cycle of attracting ever more candidates who, by failing, contribute to its aura
of selectivity. Despite evidence that the vast majority of aspirants fail
to pass the JEE, increasing numbers of families send their children

to coaching centers to train them for the test. Although the cost of
coaching centers can put middle- class and lower- middle- class families

into debt, the JEE as a stepping- stone to fnancial success and social

mobility makes this investment seem worthwhile.

As with other examinations, IIT aspirants often turn to spiritual

intercession for securing a passing mark. The stories of family _pujas_ and

pilgrimages leading up to the JEE echo accounts of the de- secularization

of examinations in East Asia. It is clear from such accounts that the
competitive examination is by no means a rationalized exercise. Rather,
it is a key collective ritual where the role of the sacred in determining
outcomes persists. [2]

It is not just belief in divine intervention that has survived the rise

of the modern examination. So, too, have understandings of innate intelligence. The scale of a test like the JEE elicits a world of social commentary around who is destined to succeed or fail. In these evaluations

of success and failure, caste as an index of intellectual merit is very
much in play. This raises the question of what the relationship is between ascription and achievement in the dynamics of the modern examination. How does the IIT- JEE stage this relationship? And how is

caste reconstituted through this pro cess?

Ascription and Achievement

The competitive examination is commonly taken as an index of
modern meritocracy. Unlike older forms of patronage, which rest on
networks of power and affiliation, the modern examination is thought
to create a level playing feld where any and all can participate. The
only form of capital deemed necessary is one’s ability; other forms of
inherited social and cultural capital are supposed to be irrelevant. It is
through this purported shift from ascription to achievement that the
modern examination comes to symbolize meritocracy. [3]


-----

TESTING MERIT 155

When looking at the history of examinations, however, we see that

indices of evaluation are more often cumulative. Examinations are not
culturally or socially neutral. Rather than the end of ascription, examinations mark the layering of seemingly objective, socially neutral criteria on top of older evaluations of relative social worth. As fltering
mechanisms, they favor those who come from histories of education

and have a fa cil i ty with this technical instrument. They also work to

reproduce existing social hierarchies in a post facto way: examination
results are typically read to reinforce rather than unsettle commonsense understandings of relative merit.

Pierre Bourdieu and Jean- Claude Passeron have written exhaustively

about how the prestigious examination and elite higher education guarantee the reproduction of older social hierarchies. Examinations and
elite institutions do so, they argue, by “concealing social se lection

under the guise of technical se lection and legitimating the reproduc-

4
tion of social hierarchies by transmuting them into academic hierarchies.” In the pro cess, older hierarchies and affinities are reproduced,

but now in the name of objectivity, egalitarianism, and meritocracy.

But, they continue, examinations do not do this all on their own.

As “downstream events,” they rely on other aspects of social structure
to regulate access. As they put it, “In every country, the inequalities

between the classes are incomparably greater when mea sured by the

_probabilities of candidature . . ._ than when mea sured by the _probabil-_

_ities of passing._ ” [5] While the examination does perform a gatekeeping
function by passing some and failing others, Bourdieu and Passeron

maintain that this result is actually preempted by the broader structure of social and economic relations, which eliminate most even from
candidacy.

They also make the point that highly valued formal qualifcations,

such as the passing of prestigious exams and attendance at elite educational institutions, do more than they claim. While they formally
certify technical competence, their real value is in the attestation of
cultural competence. In other words, examinations and degrees appear
to be formal markers of achievement when they in fact “act as proxies
for ascription.” [6] In acting as proxies for ascription, examinations blur the
distinction between innate and learned ability. Success or failure seems
to point to something innate in the candidate that the examination


-----

156 THE CASTE OF MERIT

merely illustrates. Achievement is thus glossed not as the outcome of
a set of learned practices but as a refection of ascriptive qualities. In
this sense, the examination contributes to the naturalization of talent.
Moreover, as a seemingly absolute mea sure of intellectual ability—

even social worth— the examination reinforces the relative merit of

the successful.

Fi nally, in addition to determining success and failure, the exami-

nation also generates gradations of rank among the successful. These

gradations produce the effect of individuation, where the social and intellectual worth of the individual becomes an extension of the rank.
As a more fne- grained outcome, ranking also contributes to the sense

of the examination as a fne- tuned technical instrument whose effi-

cacy in gauging relative worth is beyond question.

Together, these three aspects of the modern examination—

gatekeeping, cultural certifcation, and ranking— set in motion the

dialectic between ascription and achievement. The scale and technical
dimensions of the examination seem to depart from older models of
se lection through patronage and affiliation. However, the promise

of open access and equal opportunity embodied in the examination as
a rationalized instrument is belied by the structuring force of economic and social relations and the ideological power of cultural assumptions. Success in examination is by no means merely a mea sure

of individual competence. It is made pos si ble by the accumulated ad-

vantages of unequal opportunity, and it reinforces prejudices about
who is or who is not innately talented. In other words, it is profoundly
social and cultural in its structure and its effects. The success or failure
of an individual is commonly understood as an index of “culture,” or
of the essential traits of the person’s social group and milieu.

The history of mass examinations in India illuminates this dia-

lectic between ascription and achievement. From as early as the mid-
nineteenth century, we see efforts to promote the examination as the

actualization of modern meritocracy while ensuring its function as a
gatekeeping, certifying, and ranking device sustaining existing social
hierarchies. But we also see interventions in the examination pro cess,

which seek to correct for the structuring force of accumulated privileges and cultural assumptions. As I will show, such redistributive

mea sures often had the unintended effect of reinforcing rather than


-----

TESTING MERIT 157

loosening the link between ascription and achievement. They set in
motion a more strident politics of meritocracy through which ascriptive status became a more explicit basis for claims to meritocratic
achievement.

Imperial Liberalism and the Examination

Within the British Empire, the Indian Civil Ser vice (ICS) was the frst

instance where recruitment shifted from patronage to competitive examinations. Earlier, the East India Com pany had founded its own col-

lege at Haileybury in England, from which the com pany’s directors

nominated candidates for the ICS. Until 1860, the directors of the East

India Com pany and the ICS were recruited almost entirely from Lon-

don’s banking and commercial families, and from landed groups in
Scotland and the southeast of England. Not only did they share class

backgrounds, but their cultural and economic ties were also buttressed

by ties of descent and affinity. From 1840 to 1860, “ffty or sixty interconnected extended families contributed the vast majority of the civil
servants who governed India.” [7] Among the top reasons given for the
appointment of civil servants by the East India Com pany’s Court of

Directors were, in descending order, friendship, kinship, business re-

lationships, com pany ser vice, po liti cal recommendation, and recom-

mendation of board of control.

In the 1850s, members of the Liberal Party challenged this model

of appointment by patronage as outmoded. Instead, they argued for the
institution of a competitive examination as a way to preempt more radical, unmanageable popu lar demands. Such reforms would entail a

“voluntary renunciation of patronage” in accordance with changing
standards of po liti cal morality. To echo John Adams, the competitive

examination was instituted at a time when “an old aristocracy of birth
concluded an alliance with a new aristocracy of intellect.” [8]

The institution of competitive examinations for the civil ser vices

in both England and India dovetailed with pressures on the university

system. Throughout the early nineteenth century, Britain’s universi-

ties suffered a crisis of identity, most clearly seen in rising rates of
gradu ate unemployment. As the numbers of gradu ates rose, there was

no parallel growth in their traditional areas of employment: education,


-----

158 THE CASTE OF MERIT

the clergy, and the bar. The introduction of recruitment by competitive examination allowed the universities to repurpose themselves in
a more utilitarian mold. Not every one agreed, and a sizable opposition

argued for university reform along German lines to make them centers of research and scholarship for “training scholars, not rulers.” India
offered a space for compromise: as part of training for the civil ser vice,

teaching in the feld of Oriental languages and in Indian geography and
history also expanded. As Thomas Macaulay opined, this would provide “fresh incentives for the middle and lower classes to attain high

educational standards.” [9]

Ultimately, the competitive examination won cabinet approval— not

on educational or po liti cal grounds but as a means to enhance admin-

istrative efficiency. Liberals and conservatives alike agreed that drawing
from a much larger pool of talent was necessary at a time when administrative responsibilities weighed ever more heavi ly on civil servants.

In both England and India, “a new type of civil ser vice seemed neces-

sary; a civil ser vice selected for competence, not connection, and pro-

moted for ability, not se niority.” [10]

Although the Home Ser vice was actually considered to be in worse

shape, it was the ICS that was the object of most reformist concern.
This was partly because the East India Com pany administration had

become synonymous with entrenched, corrupt patronage, but it was
also because of the perceived relationship between colonial adminis-

trators and Indians. The Indian civil servant was thought to “exercise
a power for good or evil which no En glish civil servant— perhaps no

functionary in the world— possessed.” Macaulay made the most stri-

dent argument for the scholar- gentleman as the most appropriate choice

for such responsibility. “Has it not always been the case,” he argued,
“that the men who were frst in the competition of the schools have

been frst in the competition of life?” For Macaulay, examination success correlated not just with career success but with “character.” [11]

Initially, Macaulay’s ambition was fulflled. In the frst year of the

open examination in 1855, 70 percent of successful candidates were Ox-

bridge educated, and the average for the next four years was almost
60 percent. But this was followed by a precipitous decline, and by 1864,

only 10 percent of recruits were from Oxbridge. Moreover, the propor-

tion of successful candidates of all universities also fell.


-----

TESTING MERIT 159

The culprit was “the crammer.” ICS aspirants sidestepped univer-

sities and went straight to crammers, institutions that were opened in

response to market demand for a new examination for which students
were given intense preparation in a short period of time. This was due
to the structure of the examination itself. Although Macaulay had envisioned the Oxbridge gradu ate as the ideal candidate, there was little

overlap between university curricula, with their early specialization
in mathe matics and the classics, and the general intelligence tested by

the ICS examination. Moreover, the age ceiling of nineteen for ICS candidature meant that aspirants had to choose between years spent at
university and going straight to India. As a result, the ICS was quickly

taken over by gradu ates of the crammers and not of Oxbridge.

This was an unanticipated outcome. The point of the examination

was to transfer the education of India’s civil servants to the universities, not to crammers. An inquiry in 1874 by the Duke of Argyll, then
secretary of state for India, produced an indictment of the crammer as
the negation of the liberal education envisioned by the 1854 reforms.
The crammer also induced anx i eties around colonial rule, which his-

torian Clive Dewey captures in trenchant prose:

Cramming was intellectually superfcial; worse—in an era of muscular Chris tian ity, it neglected morality and physique. Its prevalence

aggravated existing doubts about the quality of the competition-
wallah. The competition- wallah— the product of cramming— might

be more intelligent than his Haileybury- educated pre de ces sors, more

prolifc and agile with a pen; but was he also a gentleman? Was not
his physique so weakened by excessive concentration on the book
work needed to succeed in the open examination that his health
broke down in India? Of sedentary disposition, could he ride? Could

he inspire the same re spect in the natives? [12]

These concerns led to further proposals for reforming the pro cess

of ICS recruitment. First, Argyll proposed a revived Haileybury housed

within one of the universities. This was shot down and replaced with
a suggestion from the universities that examination candidates follow
with a two- year probationary course at Oxbridge. This would ensure

additional fltering after the crammers without putting the full burden

for training on the universities. But even this proved unsatisfactory,


-----

160 THE CASTE OF MERIT

and eventually, in 1892, a further set of reforms raised the maximum
age limit from nineteen to twenty- three and aligned aspects of the

examination more closely with Oxbridge honors courses. With this,
Macaulay’s dream f nally came to pass: the proportion of non- university

recruits fell to 6 percent, and Oxbridge gradu ates climbed back up to

78 percent.

Though all these shifts, we see that arguments in favor of the open

examination and against patronage were not really about demo cratizing

access. There was always an envisioned ideal candidate: the Oxbridge

gradu ate. Official hostility to the crammer expressed anx i eties around

the entry of those who did not ft the liberal imaginary of the colonial

civil servant. As Macaulay and others saw it, the crammer undercut

the ability of the examination to flter out socially and intellectually
undesirable aspirants. The reforms instituted in 1874 and 1892 were

corrective mea sures intended to allow the examination to perform its

gatekeeping function and produce the desired se lection of civil servants

with the appropriate cultural credentials.

Much of this negotiation was around the ideal _metropolitan_ candi-

date for the ICS. But what about expatriate British candidates from the
colony? The increase in the maximum age of applicants came about
through opposition not from within England but from India. The pre-

vious ceiling of nineteen years had effectively cut out expatriate competitors altogether because it did not allow time for them to come to

England, attend a crammer, and prepare for the examination. Such opposition from India found an advocate in Viceroy Ripon, who viewed
the ICS examination as a critical tool for inducting expatriates into
metropolitan po liti cal culture. This unifcation of the Home Ser vice

and the Indian Civil Ser vice under a common cultural umbrella, he

believed, was the best bulwark against Indian nationalism. It was this
that led Ripon to endorse the increased maximum age of recruits so
that colonials would have time to imbibe metropolitan norms. Such
norms, he hoped, would equip the expatriate with the necessary tools
to withstand the pressures of colonial politics and remain true to the
imperial mission.

Once again we see here that the examination was by no means

simply an acultural, objective tool of testing. It was a pro cess of culti-

vation through which those who ft a desired cultural mold were fa-

vored and those who did not were disciplined into new ways of thinking

and being. As we saw in Chapter 1 with the engineering ser vice, the

examination as a form of discipline was applied to the British themselves in order to address differences in class and context and to identify the ideal gentleman- generalist for ser vice in India. [13]

Recall Bourdieu and Passeron’s argument about exams concealing

social se lection under the guise of technical se lection. What was the

social se lection that the ICS examination legitimated? Signifcantly,

“neither extreme of the social spectrum was represented in the Indian
civil ser vice.” [14] Of the 1,600 or so recruits selected at forty examina-

tions between 1858 and 1897, only one was the son of a manual worker,
and the number of aristocrats was equally negligible. For the most part,
recruits came from three middle- class groups in the following order:

the sons of professionals, the sons of businessmen, and the sons of
farmers or lesser gentry. While there was some fuctuation in repre sen-

ta tion within these categories, the ICS was a solidly middle- class cadre.

It is this class character of the modern examination that most con-

tributes to its popu lar perception as the linchpin of meritocracy. Un-

like erstwhile forms of patronage through which candidates were nom-

inated on the basis of elite social networks, the examination connotes
the dawn of individual ability and achievement as the basis for selection. It is emblematic of a shift from an older model of patronage to
liberal governance. Of course, this was not about unlimited opportunity. Rather, to quote Bourdieu and Passeron again, “the probabilities of
candidature” were already limited to those endowed with certain forms

of educational and cultural capital. [15] Sons of manual workers were not

included in the shift from rule by patronage to rule by examination.

What this suggests is an amendment to Bourdieu and Passeron’s ar-

gument: the ICS examination was not simply a reproduction of the
status quo. It also occasioned a shift in the relative weight of par tic-

u lar social constituencies in the proj ect of rule and thus points to the

need to attend to both the reproductive and the transformative role of
the competitive examination.

Indian Recruitment to the Civil Ser vices

All of this wrangling over ICS recruitment occurred before the Indianization of the ser vices. As we saw in Chapter 1, in the early twen-

tieth century, Indians began to level strident criticisms against the


-----

162 THE CASTE OF MERIT

racial glass ceiling in the civil ser vices. How did this criticism relate

to the rise of the competitive examination?

While the recruitment of officers in England to the ICS and the

Indian Police Ser vice was carried out through competitive examina-

tions, recruitment remained by nomination in other ser vices. In the

engineering ser vice, the secretary of state would call for applications,

a committee would be appointed to assess candidate qualifcations,
and, on the basis of an interview at the India Office, a se lection would

be made. Candidates also had to pass a medical examination and a
riding test before they could be confrmed.

In India, too, nomination was the norm in recruiting officers. No

competitive examinations were held before the end of World War I

because the country’s education system was considered insufficiently
developed and too unevenly distributed for examinations to yield the
required type and mix of officers. The result of recruitment by nomination was a preponderance of Anglo- Indians and domiciled Eu ro pe ans in

those branches of government ser vices for which officers were recruited

in India. This favoritism was compounded by the disparity in the educational requirements stipulated for candidates of dif fer ent categories.

To be eligible for certain subordinate posts, Anglo- Indians and domi-

ciled Eu ro pe ans, who were usually educated in schools meant exclu-

sively for them, were only required to complete the “Eu ro pean schools”

curriculum, whereas “native” Indians had to be university gradu ates. [16]

Opposition to nomination as a racially weighted pro cess resulted

in a set of reforms. The Islington Commission, instituted to look into
recruitment reform, suggested mea sures to improve the nomination

pro cess toward increasing the proportion of Indians in the ser vices.

These included creating se lection committees with Indian members,

advertising openings systematically, and starting new technical institutions. As part of the reforms, an ICS exam was instituted in India in
1922, but it was held after the London exam each year, which limited

its importance as a leveling instrument. [17]

We see here that when it came to Indian recruitment, the exami-

nation was seen as too risky a technology to ensure the appropriate results. The racial par ameters of rule could not be guaranteed with such

a pro cess. Instead, recruitment by nomination remained the norm in

the colony. For nationalists, the discrepancy between examination in
England and nomination in the colony took on huge signifcance. Uni-


-----

versalizing the examination as a technology of se lection became the

silver bullet that would solve the intractable prob lems of racial bias and

exclusion. With the transition to self- rule, the examination came into

its own as the mea sure of merit par excellence. Over the postin de pen-

dence period, examinations have proliferated across the subcontinent,
their scale continuously expanding with the growth in education. The
most competitive of these— the Union Public Ser vice Commission

(UPSC) exam, which was the postcolonial iteration of the ICS exam;
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India exam; and the IIT-
JEE— are also the ones that are most associated with upper- caste in-

telligence and competitiveness. As we will see with the IIT- JEE, the

dialectic between ascription and achievement has become a crucial
part of the se lection pro cess and of charged public debate.

Examinations in In de pen dent India and the IIT- JEE

It is strange to look back to the late colonial debate over the viability
of the competitive examination as a technology of se lection in India.

From the vantage point of con temporary India’s examination fever, it

seems surreal that this was ever a question. The mass examination is
now an integral organ izing princi ple of Indian education and, indeed,

of Indian social life. It is an annual ritual that has become as naturalized as the monsoons. How has the postin de pen dence spread of exami-

nations shaped the dialectic between ascription and achievement?

Sociologist of education Krishna Kumar addresses this question in

his discussion of “early se lection” and “mass examination,” two struc-

turing mechanisms of India’s educational system. Early se lection

tracks elite students into separate tiers of training through which they
effectively exit the general pool of applicants. The stratifcation of educational institutions into elite and non- elite, private and public, un-

derwrites this early se lection pro cess and offers the children of the elite

“safe routes towards status professions.” It is in effect a mechanism of

reproduction in which ascriptive characteristics of family, caste, and

18
class are transmuted into indices of merit and secured through a parallel educational track.

In this context where institutional stratifcation and privatization

undercuts the possibility of a truly mass education system, the examination holds out the promise of parity. The rituals of the mass


-----

164 THE CASTE OF MERIT

examination— paper- setting shrouded in secrecy, strict invigilation

during the exam, and the public declaration of results— carry the sym-

bolic message that all individuals have an equal chance. It stands in
for open competition and equal opportunity. In this sense, Kumar argues, the practice of mass examinations acts as a symbolic corrective
to institutional stratifcation and elite reproduction. [19] It does so by
foregrounding the universality of achievement over the particularity
of ascription.

What about the internal mechanisms of the examination? Sociolo-

gist Satish Deshpande points to two types of examinations in India—
exit and entrance— each with its specifc characteristics. Exit exams

advance students from one stage to another of the educational hierarchy. Signifcantly, the expanding educational opportunities in postcolonial India have been accompanied by lowering rates of failure; the pass
percentages for exit examinations tend to be very high. Nevertheless,
the assumption that this means increasingly higher levels of education
for the population as a whole is belied by the pyramidal structure of

enrollment, with the numbers of those who advance dropping steadily

from primary school to secondary, higher secondary, and college.

In this sense, factors other than the exit examination itself are

impor tant for explaining the increasing exclusivity of higher levels of

education. Bourdieu and Passeron’s analy sis of “self- elimination” is sa-

lient here. As they point out, non- elite students are more likely to

“eliminate themselves” from higher levels of education because of the

social expectation of failure. In other words, ascription— who is des-

tined for certain paths and not others— delimits the feld of competi-

tion in such a way that achievement is always a greater possibility for
those social groups who enjoy inherited privilege.

What about the entrance examination? Deshpande points to a

striking contrast between the pass percentages of exit and entrance
examinations in India. Whereas the pass percentages of exit examinations are typically in the 70–90 percent range, those for entrance

examinations are dramatically lower. The three examinations with
the highest number of applicants— the UPSC exam, the Institute of

Chartered Accountants of India exam, and the IIT- JEE— tend to have

pass percentages between 2.6 and 2.8. Deshpande argues that these

low rates of admission are “an artefact of the very status of the exami-


-----

TESTING MERIT 165

nation itself.” [20] Because these examinations symbolize stepping-

stones to social mobility, they attract a large number of aspirants who
have no realistic chance of passing. In this sense, “the prestige of the
examination . . . tautologically reaffirms itself by attracting a large

number of candidates who are essentially cannon fodder and contribute
to the aura of selectivity that surrounds the examination.” [21]

Deshpande also points to another crucial aspect of entrance exami-

nations: their confation of eligibility and excellence. He argues that
exams like the JEE need to push the ideology of excellence to obscure
the long- standing inequalities, especially in access to higher education,

that have structured a society like India. Excellence becomes a crucial
rationale for justifying the concentration of opportunities and resources
that underwrites the reproduction of privilege. Deshpande notes that
“the typical competitive exam claims to mea sure excellence or ‘max-

imum merit’ ” rather than the more modest claim of establishing a

threshold of competence. [22] He adds that this ideology of excellence is
very difficult to shake. Once the examination is established on these

grounds, any suggestion that what might be at stake is not excellence
“appears as an insult to the exalted ethical- intellectual status of the

already- sacralised examination.” [23]

The overinvestment in notions of excellence has generated an ob-

session with ranking. The JEE is a particularly good example of how
the minute rank ordering of candidates comes to stand in for differential intelligence. It is also a clear indication of the absurd limits to
which ranking can extend. Deshpande offers the example of the 2009
JEE, in which “the 501st rank had an aggregate mark of 302 (out of 489),
while the 5,501st rank had an aggregate of exactly 200 marks.” [24] There

were as many as 5,000 ranks within a mere 102- mark range, or “an av-

erage difference of 0.02 marks per candidate.” [25] These minuscule dif-

ferences in scores acquire far more weight when they are translated
into neatly distinguished ranks as the objective truth of relative intelligence. Deshpande goes further, calling the ranking system “a moral-
ethical ordering” that allows “the most vocal and resource- rich groups

in society . . . to maximize their advantage over the rest of society.” [26]

When it comes to the JEE, the rigidly ranked results do not just en-

sure entry into the IITs; they also limit the degree to which successful
candidates can choose their institute and branch of engineering. Here,


-----

166 THE CASTE OF MERIT

other hierarchies come into play. As we saw in Chapter 4, the pecking
order of branches has shifted over time from civil engineering to computer science on top. Since most IITians faithfully follow the hierarchy
of branches in vogue, the status of the JEE rank is further reinforced
by the status of the branch one chooses.

At the IITs, ranking does not end with the JEE. The preoccupation

with ranks persists all the way through campus life. The acronym
“RG” refers to the system of relative grading through which students
are made acutely aware of where they stand in relation to their peers.
Udhay, a 1990s alumnus of IIT Madras, put it this way: “Your entire
focus is on a good rank. It’s not just that you get a pass or fail on an
examination. It’s actually your rank that matters, which means that

how well you do relative to others is more impor tant than what you

have learned. That thought is sort of ingrained in your preparation for
IIT and it continues through into IIT also.” [27]

The rank also follows students on their way out of the institution.

In the job se lection pro cess, recruiters almost always inquire after the

candidate’s JEE rank, which matters as much if not more than the cu-

mulative grade point average over the years in the institute. The JEE
rank with which one enters remains the ultimate signifer of intellectual merit. Let us now turn to IIT Madras for a more in- depth look at

the social meanings associated with the JEE.

The Social Meanings of the JEE

The IIT- JEE represents the fullest realization of India’s examination fe-

tish. When IIT Madras opened in 1959, the all India entrance examination was not yet in place. In the frst two years, students were chosen

based on their per for mance in school board examinations. Even after

the institution of the JEE in 1961, the se lection pro cess was frst ad-

ministered regionally, or zonally, with a certain percentage of seats allotted to each zone. The all India se lection that now exists began in

1962, but it was only in the 1970s that the number of applicants started
to steadily rise. By the late 1990s, the JEE had acquired a mythical
status as the stepping- stone to private sector fnancial success.

The expanding scope of the exam had a signifcant effect on the

perception of its outcomes. As an all India exam, it came to be seen as


-----

TESTING MERIT 167

a national arbiter of merit. The sheer scale of the JEE and its fnely calibrated results reinforced its standing as an objective mea sure of indi-

vidual intellectual worth and made the student’s All India Rank, or
AIR, into an indisputable index of innate abilities. The AIR acquired
a talismanic quality that marked the individual for life. Throughout
the 1980s and 1990s, engineering education was a growth industry, particularly in southern India. During this period, the JEE sealed its reputation as the ultimate test of conceptual prowess and the stepping-
stone to economic mobility, attracting increasing numbers of students
who wanted to try their hand in a national competition.

In terms of its national scale, the JEE was the direct descendant of

the UPSC exam. The increasing scale of the JEE also changed the social profle of applicants to be more aligned with the UPSC. Unlike in
the 1960s, when the number of applicants was smaller and the social
composition of IIT Madras cohorts included both the wealthy and some
poor students, the JEE’s expansion was largely due to its growing attraction for aspirants from upper- caste professional families. These

were the students whose parents were typically employed in the cen-

tral government ser vices, where they had been acculturated into the

intense competitiveness of the UPSC exam. As participants in another
all India ritual, these parents made a point of training their children

to successfully pass the JEE, making caste and class history key to
exam success. At the same time, the generational shift from the UPSC
to the JEE reinforced a sense of middle- class status, since both exams

were understood to be objective flters of individual ability dissociated
from other structural factors. After the 1970s, this class sensibility was

further enhanced by the growing exodus of IITians to the United States,
where they encountered another national myth of middle- class, meri-

tocratic individualism. All these factors— the expanding scale of the

JEE, its tightening association with an educated middle class, and the

infuence of diasporic experiences— had a signifcant impact on the

perception of caste, which increasingly came to be foregrounded as a
cultural identity and obscured as a form of inherited advantage. To put
it in the terms we have been considering thus far, ascription was reconciled with achievement by delinking caste from capital.

In this sense, IITians as a whole came increasingly into line with

what was previously characteristic of a Tamil Brahmin worldview.


-----

168 THE CASTE OF MERIT

As we will see, this had a signifcant impact on attitudes toward JEE

coaching— the con temporary version of the colonial crammer— and

caste- based reservation. Both came to be perceived as illegitimate im-

pediments to the smooth operation of the JEE, which prevented the
exam from selecting those it was meant to select.

_Innate Intelligence_

In Chapter 4, we saw how prevalent the idea of innate intelligence was
among 1960s alumni. Still, there was at least some recognition that

wealth and family histories of education were contributing factors in

shaping academic success. Although very few addressed caste openly,
inequalities were referenced through the rural– urban divide, fa cil i ty

with En glish, and access to consumer goods.

For alumni from the 1970s and 1980s, the growing status of the IITs,

the scope of the JEE, and its ever more fnely calibrated results seemed
to eradicate any consideration of inherited caste capital in shaping
testing outcomes. Rather, the attribution of success to “raw talent”
without any reference to structural factors was far more common.

One’s raw talent was thought to be objectifed in the JEE rank.

Nearly all the 1970s and 1980s alumni I spoke with remarked on

their single- minded aspiration to pass the JEE. In fact, passing the exam

with a good AIR was a greater ambition for most than studying engineering. The exam did not just symbolize merit; it was the very essence
of the IIT system. This sense of the JEE was conveyed to me by three
Tamil Brahmin IITians who graduated in the 1970s and 1980s. Swaminathan, a 1978 alumnus, told me that the JEE “is the only reason why
the quality of the institution didn’t diminish.” [28] Subramaniam, a 1986

alumnus, added that, to him, “what made IIT, if I think back about it,
is one thing: it’s the entrance exam.” [29] Another 1989 alumnus, Venkat,

referred to the JEE as a “fltration system that created a concentrated
gene pool.” [30]

The JEE rank is common currency at the IITs. Every one knows one

another’s rank, and this knowledge is part of everyday discourse. The
rank is an indication not just of one- time per for mance in an examina-

tion but of future success or failure. Alumni would commonly refer-

ence a peer’s JEE rank as a shorthand explanation of that person’s career

trajectory. Those instances in which the rank was not an accurate pre-


-----

TESTING MERIT 169

dictor of the future came in for much commentary. There were nu-

merous stories I heard of JEE toppers who had defed expectations by
not being particularly successful in their careers or by not being big

earners. These stories were rendered with a mix of intrigue and baffle-

ment, as if a life trajectory in defance of the examination’s evaluation
was difficult to comprehend.

One story in par tic u lar was repeated by several IIT Madras alumni.

It was of Madhavan, a Tamil Brahmin All India 4th, who earned his
PhD in electronics and communications in the United States in the
rec ord time of three years and then de cided to forgo high- paying cor-

porate jobs in order to work in the Indian nongovernmental sector. The
story took on the aspect of a parable that alumni used to point to life’s
inexplicable contingencies. Others made sense of this unorthodox tra-

jectory by folding it back into Hindu scriptural orthodoxy. Madhavan’s
choice, they maintained, was that of a sannyasi who had renounced
worldly gain for a more spiritual path.

Often, ranking would affect dynamics not just between classmates

but among family members. Madhavan himself remarked on how

much pressure his All India 4th put on his siblings. “It set a very high
bar for my brothers,” he recollected. “My middle brother got an All

India rank of 180 which is objectively very, very good, but in our family

it was seen as below par. What was terrible was my youn gest brother

who didn’t get into the IIT and was devastated by it. I tried to talk to

him but he was inconsolable for a very long time.” [31]

Beyond their exam ranks, the understanding of intelligence as in-

nate followed students into their time on campus. Sometimes this
meant that they learned to feign a lack of effort. “You have to do well
but never let on that you study,” explained Swaminathan. “You have
to act like it all somehow just comes to you.” He went on to characterize this attitude as inherently contradictory. “On the one hand you
say that it is very much by the dint of my effort that I passed the JEE
but, on the other hand, once you get in, you have to say, no, it just came
to me.” Swaminathan did not refect further on this IITian propensity.
Rather, the so cio log i cal contours of this attitude of moving between

claims to what we might call natu ral intelligence and learned intel-

ligence—or simply nature and labor— were left unexamined. Interest-

ingly, Swaminathan contrasted this IITian attitude to that prevalent


-----

170 THE CASTE OF MERIT

in the United States. “In the U.S., it’s the opposite,” he mused. “I came
to gradu ate school and saw that people were very proud of saying,

‘I pulled fve all- nighters in a row.’ You would never let that on [at IIT].

In fact, if anything, you would study when every body else was asleep.

I kid you not. And then when people are awake you go around saying,

‘What are you wasting your time for?’ ” Here we have yet another in-

stance of the dialectic between ascription and achievement. While
IITian exceptionalism invariably references the JEE, which appears to
provide objective proof of intellectual standing through individual
achievement, there is a discourse of ascription, of innate abilities, that

is always close at hand.

This ideology of innateness is also evident among the JEE’s test

setters: IIT faculty. In the labor of organ izing the JEE, we see efforts

to shore up its ability to flter out the unmeritorious. IIT faculty tried to
stay one step ahead of the increasing pressure on the evaluation process through continuously reforming its structure and content. Key
to this pro cess was striking the right balance between objective and

subjective questions, with the former seen as a test of learning and the
latter of innate conceptual ability. The notion of true merit as innate
ability was manifest in the creation of a two- tier exam involving a frst

tier of a fully objective screening exam and a second tier of conceptual
prob lems in physics, chemistry, and mathe matics. The two- tier pro cess

was not simply a technical solution to the practical impossibility of
subjective grading at the growing scale of the JEE; rather, it was “an
expression of par tic u lar values: the ‘merit’ of a candidate is seen in his

innate talent; the years of coaching a candidate goes through to succeed are distrusted and seen only as a mea sure of his endurance.” [32] The

JEE reforms are reminiscent of the reforms of the colonial ICS exam.
Now, as then, the tension between the putative universality of access
and the highly par tic u lar vision of the ideal candidate set in play an

endless pro cess of adjustment aimed at producing the “correct” out-

come. The exam had to do what it was supposed to do: select those with

innate talent, or true merit.

_Being_ _Middle Class_

What is the form of merit that the JEE tacitly certifes and that Swaminathan referenced through the claim to natu ral intelligence? Many


-----

TESTING MERIT 171

alumni spoke of the examination in terms that illuminated another
aspect of the JEE: its perception as a vehicle of middle- class mobility.

For them, this is what makes the JEE— and, by extension the IITs—

truly meritocratic.

In some ways, IITian understandings of being middle class are very

much in keeping with defnitions elsewhere. One key aspect is fairness. Almost all the alumni I spoke with highlighted the impartiality
of the JEE. In a country whose educational system is thought to be corrupted by nepotism and money power, the JEE has come to represent a
shining example of the incorruptibility of the IITs. Sandipan Deb captures this sentiment with a rhetorical question: “How did this Third
World nation manage to invent an entrance examination system that
is the toughest and fairest of its kind in the world, and maintain the
integrity of that system through half a century, so that even an Indian

President’s son stands as much (or, to be more precise, as little) chance

of getting through?” [33] For Deb, the JEE is what symbolizes the IITs’
transcendence of Indian conditions to be on par with First World meritocracy. It is what allows the middle class equal opportunity for ad-

mission. Here he is again: “The only way, the salaried middle class has

always believed, that its children could get a fair chance to earn an

honest living was to excel academically, do so well in their examinations that ‘pull’ did not matter.” The contrast between “pull” and “fair-

ness” rests on a well- worn binary between politics and virtue that un-

derwrites the story of the middle class as representative of demo cratic

modernity. “Once you had the ‘IIT stamp’ on your biodata,” Deb avers,
“the lack of ‘pull’ was not something to be both ered about at all.” [34]

As with Deb, most IITians foreground the JEE’s imperviousness to

po liti cal corruption as its signal characteristic. Across interviews, I

heard versions of this refrain: “ Here, not even a power ful politician can

use his infuence to get his child admitted.” The inordinate amount of
labor that goes into developing the examination papers each year and
guarding against leaks that might compromise the integrity of the
exam speaks to the faith IIT faculty and administrators have in its role
as a near- perfect arbiter of intellectual worth. That applicants are ad-

mitted solely on the basis of their per for mance on the exam is taken

as proof of the system’s integrity. In singling out overt _po_ _liti_ _cal_ infu-

ence as the only threat to fairness, what such assessments of the JEE


-----

172 THE CASTE OF MERIT

sidestep is the question of _societal_ infuence. They obscure the ways

35
in which the JEE as a test of “excellence” builds on and extends histories of unequal caste capital.

IITians go beyond lauding the JEE for its imperviousness to po liti cal

infuences. For them, its socially blind pro cess of evaluation actually

makes the examination a social equalizer. Swaminathan put this most
succinctly and in comparative terms: “I still think it is truly egalitarian,”
he maintained.

You go in for 6 hours on one day and 6 hours on the next day. You
take an exam in mathe matics and physics and chemistry and

En glish . . . and that’s it. That’s what matters. Your school grades

don’t matter, who wrote letters for you doesn’t matter, which I think

is a good thing. And the closest I can see to that— certainly nothing

in the U.S.— but in France there is the _grandes_ _écoles,_ I’m sure you

are aware. Napoleon did that for them, because there was a university

system which was very good but it wasn’t a system that allowed

people to come in from all walks of life. It wasn’t a mixer, it wasn’t

an equalizer. The _grandes_ _écoles_ started to play that role.

It is striking that Swaminathan draws a parallel between the ex-

aminations for the IITs and those for the _grandes_ _écoles_ — the two most

elite tiers of higher education in their respective national contexts—
as social equalizers. As with the IITs, the _grandes_ _écoles_ were deliber-

ately set apart from the national university system as a distinct and
superior stratum for which the competition for admission was far more
intense and the se lection pro cess far more exclusionary. Another sim-

ilarity is in how they model meritocracy through their examination
pro cess but end up being technologies of social reproduction in their

examination outcomes. The like the IITs, stage the dialectic between achievement and ascription in such a way that achievers _grandes_ _écoles,_
come from a very narrow social segment.

However, unlike the forms of distinction operating at the _grandes_

_écoles,_ IITians have an acute sense of themselves as non- elites, which

derives from the complex relationship between class and caste. [36] We
see this complexity in Swaminathan’s remarks about class and labor.

He noted that IITians’ per for mance of innate intelligence and dis-

dain toward hard work was reminiscent of “the upper- class, En glish


-----

TESTING MERIT 173

aristocracy. . . . Things have to be ingrained. . . . That’s very much the

landed- gentry attitude. Why would I do something which would actu-

ally require me to work? It should just come to me.” Swaminathan’s
effort to explain the IITian by recourse to both notions of egalitarianism and aristocratic culture gives us some sense of this blend of
self- defnitions, eco nom ically non- elite on the one hand and culturally

elite on the other.

The understanding of education is key here. The primacy of educa-

tion was a ubiquitous refrain across interviews with 1970s and 1980s
alumni. This was reinforced by their own trajectories after graduation.

Most went on to get higher degrees in engineering or related felds.
Among these, some went on in academia and others shifted to industry.

Those who stayed in India tended to supplement their engineering degrees with MBAs. The vast majority of alumni from these de cades

underscored their difference from those who came from industrial or

commercial wealth. They, by contrast, had “only” educational capital.
Chatterjee, a Bengali Brahmin 1982 alumnus, put it this way:

All the kids I knew and all their parents viewed that there were two

ways, roughly speaking, for their kids to make a living if they were

not families that owned businesses and stores. If that’s not what you
were but part of the professional class of people in India— they were

educated certainly but they were not owners of businesses and so

forth— for these people they felt that their kids had to go in one of

two routes in order to succeed, which was either to become a doctor

or to become an engineer. . . . If you like mathe matics, you were des-

tined to become an engineer and try to get into the IITs, and if you
like biology, you were destined to try to get into one of the premier

medical colleges. That was the bifurcation. [37]

Such remarks by IITians about educational achievement point to

their varied treatment of dif fer ent forms of capital. Chatterjee’s char-

acterization of the professions effaces education not only as a form of
capital but, more specifcally, as a form of caste capital. Unlike land
and business, alumni treat education not as inherited capital tied to
histories of caste but as individual achievement. Moreover, by dissociating education from caste histories of privilege, upper- caste IITians

deny that it is an index of in equality. This fungibility is a function of


-----

174 THE CASTE OF MERIT

the place of modern education— and, more so, technical education—

within demo cratic society. As a purported leveler of opportunity, it

stands in for individual, meritocratic achievement and not the social
reproduction of privilege. Modern education allows its benefciaries to
obscure continuities with forms of putatively “nonmodern” capital
that make education a collective inheritance.

The JEE is key to this fungibility through which caste inheritance

is equated with individual merit. To build on Bourdieu and Passeron,
the JEE worked at two levels: it formally certifed individual achievement, and it tacitly endorsed ascriptive forms of caste belonging as the
basis of intellectual ability. [38] This relationship between the formal and
the tacit is crucial: in order for caste claims to merit to appear as legitimately modern and consistent with demo cratic princi ples, it is impor-

tant that ascription remain an implicit assumption. For the examination to enact the transition from patronage and ascription to meritocracy
and achievement, caste had to be the unspoken basis of merit.

While IITians defne achievement mostly in terms of being middle

class, they also smuggle in notions of ascriptive intelligence that index
caste belonging in less overt ways. Swaminathan, for instance, gestured
to caste in his characterization of the IITs’ intellectual culture. After

saying that it was an investment in education that really set IITians

apart, he pointed to what he perceived as our shared Tamil Brahmin
identity: “In the society that I grew up in . . . very middle class . . . I

mean from your name I gather you were prob ably in the same kind of

society that I grew up [in] . . . education is every thing.” With this

oblique reference to being Tamil Brahmin, Swaminathan characterized
the middle- class culture of education as a caste phenomenon. Signif-

cantly, even when a propensity to educational achievement is attributed to caste culture, its treatment as nature and not history allows
for a simultaneous claim to individual merit. In Chapter 6 we will see

how opposition to reservation produces a far more overt claim to a caste
culture of education as a way of naturalizing intelligence and defending
against perceived threats to the IITs’ exclusivity.

As with earlier moments around the ICS exam, the relationship be-

tween ascription and achievement in the evaluation of merit is most
apparent in the face of changes that disrupt settled expectations. IIT JEE coaching was one of those changes. With the growing prestige of

the exam, the coaching industry fourished and chalked up many successes. As this postcolonial version of the crammer brought in new
groups from rural areas and small towns, it also brought demands for
reform in its wake. The idea that one could cram for the JEE challenged
its status as a test of rarefed conceptual ability. It was an indication
that the exam was tilting too far away from its desired social outcomes.
As we will see, once the JEE no longer served as an effective barrier to

entry, the claims to merit became more overt in naming the ascriptive bases of achievement. Let us turn now to an in- depth look at the

impact of coaching on the relationship between caste and merit.

The Coaching Industry

Initially, coaching for the JEE was a much smaller- scale operation, in-

volving either private tutors or one of two coaching companies: Agrawal

Classes and Brilliant Tutorials. By the mid-2010s, JEE coaching had become a veritable industry. One 2008 estimate by India’s Associated
Chambers of Commerce and Industry values the industry at over $2
billion. [39]

There is a whole spectrum of institutions that fall under the um-

brella of JEE coaching. On one end are the classes that cater to specifc
subsets of IIT aspirants either explic itly, through their admissions pro-

cess, or as a de facto outcome of their location and pedagogical orientation. Some of these are “boutique” classes in metropolitan centers

run by “star teachers,” many of whom are themselves IIT alumni. [40]
They tend to attract students who ft the dominant mold of the upper-
caste urbanite IITian, with a family history of education and central

government employment. Then there are proj ects like Super 30 at the

Ramanujan School of Mathe matics, which I mentioned briefy in

Chapter 4. Super 30 is a coaching institution established in 2003 for the
express purpose of offering free training to thirty eco nom ically disad-

vantaged students each year, so that they can “crack” the JEE and gain
admission to the IITs. This is a very specifc intervention in the IIT
system that foregrounds the untapped brilliance of the poor and seeks to
identify and cultivate this promise. As noted earlier, the institute’s name

gestures to the unlikely life history of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a poor
Brahmin who became one of the world’s foremost mathematical minds.

176 THE CASTE OF MERIT

At the other end of the spectrum from these more specialized

centers is coaching at an industrial scale. The two sites that have become most emblematic of this scale of coaching are the cities of Kota
in Rajasthan and Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh. Beginning in the
1990s, Kota transformed into a coaching hub, with more than 150
centers that admit students from as early as the seventh grade and
drill them for years in JEE preparation. This is a major money- making

operation. Approximately 160,000 teen agers attend Kota’s coaching

institutes every year, paying between 50,000 and 100,000 rupees (ap-

proximately US$740 to $1,480) as annual tuition. In a few institutes,
they are taught by IIT alumni, who claim salaries of 15 million–20
million rupees (approximately US$220,000 to $296,000) for their expertise. Neither coaching centers nor their affiliated hostels have exit
policies or refunds, so for students from poorer families who borrow
money to come to Kota, the stakes are even higher. Similarly, Hyderabad
has transformed into a second coaching hub with an ever- expanding

student constituency. We will look at coaching in Hyderabad at more

length at the end of the chapter through an in- depth account of one

student’s experiences.

The competition between Kota and Hyderabad was showcased in a

which tracked the intense rivalry between the two cities to secure top rankers in JEE admissions. The article begins by announcing that “Coaching institutes sensationalist 2011 essay in the _Times of India,_
headquartered in Hyderabad have outdone Kota as the preparatory
mecca for IIT- JEE” and then offers a blow- by- blow account of the “race”:

If JEE-2010 results are pored over, the maximum number of candidates to clear the exam was from Andhra Pradesh (AP). The state
dominated the merit list. Seven of the top ten rankers were from

there, the share of Kota starting only after rank 15. While in 2006,

938 candidates from AP and 1,004 from Rajasthan made it to the IITs,
a year later the tables had turned, with 1,384 from AP clearing JEE

and 1,344 from Rajasthan. It has been a close race since. In 2009, for
example, 1,862 students from AP and 1,898 from Rajasthan cleared
JEE. But just a year later, AP went for the kill, dominating the merit

list like a hungry wolf having a succulent supper after years. AP’s

success has been like a rising tide. Last year, it sealed its superb
showing by snatching the top rank. [41]

The need to publicly showcase JEE results produces intense ranking

within these coaching institutes. When students are admitted to an

institute, they start at the same level but are quickly grouped into
batches based on their per for mance on frequent review tests. Because

JEE top rankers enhance the reputation of coaching centers, students
with “top rank potential” are rapidly nosed out and given special
treatment. [42]

Students are kept constantly aware of their relative standing. There

is now an online platform for students called C- SAT (Systematic

Analy sis of Test for Classroom Students), which generates a detailed

analy sis of their per for mance that is accessible by both students and

their parents. There is also a section where student scores are compared

with those of previous JEE toppers. An android app with the tag line

“To aim is not enough— you must hit” is now available for this pur-

pose on the Google Play Store. [43]

Institutes have mechanisms of self- monitoring, such as mandatory

diaries in which students are supposed to detail their day- to- day ac-

tivities. According to a 2015 article in _India_ _Today,_ the diary required

by Kota’s Allen Career Institute is titled “Mera Sach” (My truth), and

it contains columns such as “Did I wake up prior to sunrise?” “Did I
complete my daily routine, exercise and prayer timely?” “Remembered
my parents, mentors and the career goal,” and “Took completely bal-

anced and nutritious meal[s].” The institute’s walls also offer motivational messages, such as “If you can dream it, you can do it,” “Hard [44]
work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard,” and quotes from pre-

vious IIT- JEE toppers. [45]

Not only are students within the institutes ranked, but some of the

institutes have started their own schools to identify and train students
early. For instance, one of Kota’s institutes, Career Point, started a res-

idential school called Career Point Gurukul, which covers grades six

through twelve and focuses mostly on coaching for vari ous competi-

tive examinations, including the JEE. [46] The school has on- campus

apartments where families— usually just mothers— can live with their

children, take care of them, and ensure that there are no distractions,

such as access to social media. [47]

The industry is now so lucrative that people leave corporate jobs

to work in coaching institutes. The 2015 _India_ _Today_ article cites the


-----

178 THE CASTE OF MERIT

example of a man who secured an all India rank of 41 in the 2006 IIT JEE, graduated from IIT Bombay in 2010, got placed with Goldman
Sachs, and quit after three years to come to Kota and teach physics at

Allen Career Institute, where his father, A. K. Gupta—an IIT Kanpur

alumnus— heads the IIT division. The article also points out that

coaching institutes routinely poach faculty from one another. [48]

The coaching industry has revolutionized the IIT admissions pro-

cess. Across the institutes, there are growing numbers of students who

come through the coaching centers of Hyderabad or Kota and arrive at
the IITs after years of JEE drilling. The percentage of these students— the

majority of whom are from nonprofessional, often rural family

backgrounds— receiving fnancial aid is steadily on the rise. These stu-

dents mark a signifcant departure from the institutional norm of the
upper- caste, English- speaking urbanite that coalesced over the 1970s,

1980s, and 1990s.

_The JEE Crisis and Calls for Reform_

The coaching centers of Kota and Hyderabad have come in for critical
scrutiny as the source of indebtedness and student suicides. Called
“coaching factories,” their grueling routines are likened to the industrial shopfoor, with students as grist for the mill of com pany profts.

In Kota alone, the number of suicides reached a high of thirty in 2015
and prompted calls for reform. In response, some companies have established helplines for students to call for support. However, very little

has changed in the daily routines of twelve- hour nonstop study.

For IIT man ag ers, the coaching industry has been cause for dif fer ent

concerns. In a 2008 newspaper interview about the proliferation of
coaching classes, IIT Madras’s then director M. S. Ananth clarifed that
he was “looking for students with raw intelligence and not those with

a mind prepared by coaching class tutors. The coaching classes only
help students in mastering pattern recognition skills. With this, you
This notion of “raw intelligence” places the ideal IITian outside institutional, or even social, cannot get students with raw intelligence.” [49]
formation as a naturally gifted individual with a native capacity for
technical knowledge. Raw intelligence is supposed to be an innate
characteristic that cannot be acquired through training. In conversations with Ananth and other IIT administrators, I heard their concerns


-----

TESTING MERIT 179

that the coaching industry undermined the ability of the exam to test
for those who were truly worthy.

To put it in Bourdieu’s terms, what IIT administrators fear is that

the exam is now proving unable to distinguish between what candidates _are_ from what they have _learned to do._ The exam is failing to
capture “raw intelligence” and has instead succumbed to the sustained
onslaught of coaching centers that drill students in successful per for-

mances. As these centers trumpet their successes in producing JEE top

rankers, the dialectic of ascription and achievement on which the examination rests appears to be in peril.

Just as with the colonial- era crammers, the perceived crisis of ex-

ceptionalism produced by the marketization of the JEE has generated
calls for examination reform. The hope is that reforms might reinstate
the exam as a mea sure of merit instead of just a mea sure of a student’s

ability to endure years of coaching. Some, like P. V. Indiresan, another
former director of IIT Madras, have argued that given dif fer ent circum-

stances, they would do away with the exam altogether. “If I had my
way, I would scrap the JEE in its pre sent form, because it has become a

trainable exam,” opined Indiresan. “As long as one has the stamina,
and does not get bored, you can get through the JEE. . . . To some ex-

tent, the coaching class syndrome and the willingness of the middle-
class student to devote four or fve years of his life to this entrance examination is turning the JEE into more a test of endurance than of
intelligence or talent for science.” But, Indiresan qualifed, “if the JEE
is scrapped entirely, there could be po liti cal interference in IIT admis-

sions, and that would be disastrous.” [50]

This sense of being trapped between a rock and a hard place, with

politics on one side and the market on the other, pervades IITian concerns about the transformation of the JEE. In June 2010, a panel set up
to recommend reforms announced that the JEE was to be renamed an
“aptitude test” and would constitute only 30 percent of the admissions

evaluation, with the school board exam results making up the remaining 70 percent. (The relevance of the school board exam is discussed

later in this chapter.) The move was highly controversial, fercely debated, and ultimately not implemented.

What is particularly signifcant about this sense of crisis around the

JEE is that coaching is nothing new. In fact, it is as old as the exam

180 THE CASTE OF MERIT

itself. As early as 1962, Bombay’s Agrawal Classes made news when
one of its students bagged the All India 1st rank in the JEE, making its
centers the top destination for IIT aspirants. By the early 1980s, over
55 percent of students entering the IITs were Agrawal students. In the

1984 JEE, 84 Agrawal students secured ranks within the frst All India
100. After Agrawal, a number of other coaching centers also came up,

most importantly its close competitor, Brilliant Tutorials, in 1970.

IIT alumni from previous de cades attested to the ubiquity of

coaching. Swaminathan recalled that in his 1974 cohort, “the number of
people who got in with low preparation was very low. Very, very few
people got in, and all of them were in the low ranks. The top rankers,

not one of them came in without a lot of preparation.” Jayaram, a 1980s
alumnus, concurred that “every one attended coaching classes,” al-

though many, like him, opted to do so through correspondence courses. [51]

But Jayaram’s “every one” did not actually include all IITians. Pandi-

arajan, a 1970s Backward Caste alumnus from the town of Dindigul in
southern Tamilnadu, contradicted this assumption on the part of his
peers from Chennai. He studied for the JEE on his own because there

were no coaching classes where he lived. To give me a sense of the unevenness of coaching in his day, he laid out the channels into IIT Madras
from dif fer ent parts of Tamilnadu: compared to fve students from all the

four southern districts, there were eighty just from the city of Chennai.

In other words, coaching in the 1970s was largely a metropolitan phenomenon. Pandiarajan further characterized this discrepancy in caste
terms: coaching was largely the mono poly of urban upper castes, with

Tamil Brahmins being the best represented group. [52]

What is new, then, is not coaching itself but the recent geo graph-

i cal and social expansion of the phenomenon. Now, more and more stu-

dents who might previously have thought the IITs out of their reach
have turned to Kota and Hyderabad in hopes of admission. The mass
marketing of coaching has rendered more permeable a social barrier
to entry and generated acute anx i eties among IITians about their claim

to meritocratic exceptionalism.

While calls for examination reform are one way that these anx i eties

are pro cessed, there are others. Within Chennai, the rise of boutique

coaching reinstates the distinction between upper and lower caste
through differentiations of vari ous sorts. By contrast to assessments


-----

TESTING MERIT 181

of “coaching factory” students as instrumental and mechanistic, “boutique” students are characterized as ce re bral and oriented toward the

lofty ambition of mastering conceptual knowledge. While some of
these distinctions in approaches to JEE coaching do hold, the contrast
between the conceptual and the rote does much more than differentiate training. This difference in _kind_ translates into a difference in
_status._ Within IIT Madras, the distinction between the gifted and the
coached is reproduced in everyday negotiations. Through talk about
training, students and alumni reference notions of caste and class difference that call into question the claim to a generic middle classness

on the part of more culturally elite, upper- caste IITians. Moreover, such

arguments about the conceptual versus the rote once again reprise older
colonial distinctions between mental and manual labor on the basis

of which technical education was frst stratifed.

_Inside Chennai’s Boutique Coaching Classes_

It is in reaction to the scaling up of the JEE industry and the perceived
crisis in mechanisms of distinction that a new breed of boutique
coaching has arisen. These classes revert to an older model of small-

scale private coaching that existed alongside the two earliest coaching
companies, Agrawal and Brilliant. However, they are now a conscious
departure from the model exemplifed by Kota and Hyderabad and seek
to recuperate a more conceptual approach to the JEE. Within Chennai,
boutique coaching reinstates a distinction between the gifted and the
coached along recognizable axes of differentiation. It mobilizes the
cleavages of the Non- Brahmin movement by associating the “concep-

tual” with Tamil Brahmins and the “rote” with non- Brahmins.

Madhavan, the “All India 4th” we met earlier, runs a nongovern-

mental organ ization working to enhance the quality of public primary

education in Tamilnadu. On the side, he coaches JEE classes in
Chennai. He has come to be known as a “star teacher,” whose classes
are highly sought after by students from Chennai, most of whom are

Brahmins and other upper castes. Madhavan recalled that even when
he took the JEE in 1990, JEE coaching was set apart from other tuition
classes. “Generally, you’d go for tuitions if you were not doing well in

school,” he explained. “It was insulting if you went to a tuition class.
But JEE coaching was seen differently.” This was in part because of the


-----

182 THE CASTE OF MERIT

admissions criteria set by coaching class teachers. “They would say, I
will only take people who have got above 90 [as their school marks

percentage].” Ironically, Madhavan’s tenth- grade marks did not qualify

him for admission to a coaching class, and so he ended up studying on
his own for the JEE, with some weekly help from a relative who had
been an IIT professor. For the most part, he scoured second hand book-

shops for mathe matics and physics books and trained himself “on con-

cepts.” Additionally, he did the Agrawal correspondence course and
participated in the practice testing administered by the center.

Then, Madhavan was catapulted to stardom with his JEE rank.

“ There was a lot of hype,” he told me. “Agrawal put my photo in the

newspaper. Within Chennai, there was a lot of noise. A lot of people

called, people congratulated. So, I was very happy. People told me if I

had gone to Brilliant they would have given me some 30–40,000 rupees in hand.” The hype followed him into IIT Madras as the “south
zone topper,” an achievement compounded by the fact that no one from
Chennai had gotten within the frst ten JEE ranks for quite some time.
Madhavan was even asked by the IIT Madras director to give the
opening speech at his commencement ceremony.

Unlike most other toppers, Madhavan chose the unorthodox route

of fnishing his PhD in the United States and returning to India to work
in rural popu lar science education in the nonproft sector. To make

extra money, he de cided to turn to JEE coaching, where he found a

ready- made audience because of his reputation as a JEE All India 4th.

I asked Madhavan whether he had any qualms about teaching at

the two extreme ends of the education spectrum: rural science education on the one hand, and JEE coaching on the other. Was he not just
contributing to the JEE rat race? No, he told me, because what he of-

fers “is not just teaching to the test.” In fact, he “wrote a book on why
we should not worry about exams.” What, then, are his coaching classes
for, I puzzled? “It is not that people actually go to IIT coaching to get

into IIT,” Madhavan clarifed. “They know full well they’re not going

to get into IIT. Just look at the percentages. 15 lakh [1.5 million] people

write it, a few thousand people get in. . . . The number of seats increase,

the number of people attempting increases. So why do they try? Because

there are a lot of side benefts to it. . . . Science education isn’t hap-

pening in schools today. So, there’s an alternate stream for science

education. It’s called IIT coaching.” Although he granted that his di-


-----

TESTING MERIT 183

gressions from more tailored exam coaching did elicit student and parental complaints, he insisted that his classes functioned as a catch- all

space for intellectually ambitious students who were broadly interested

in conceptual training.

What was the social composition of Madhavan’s classes? Most, he

told me, were middle- class Brahmin students, the “traditional IIT pro-

fle.” Scheduled Caste students were non ex is tent, and while Backward

Caste students were a small minority until the early 2000s, their num-

bers had increased since the extension of the Backward Caste quota to
the IITs in 2008. Madhavan also pointed to signifcant class differences.
“The Backward Caste students are actually far richer compared to the
upper caste students,” he said. “For them it is a matter of pride and pres-

tige to get in. One guy’s father is actually running a private engineering

college. Why would he try for the IITs? He can join that college, right?
He always has a college.”

In Chapter 6 we will explore in depth this prevalent sense among

Tamil Brahmins of their narrowed educational horizons in Tamilnadu,
especially in contrast to that of wealthier Backward Castes. Madhavan
himself did not endorse a notion of Brahmin victimhood, although he
did link the Tamil Brahmin aspiration to join the IITs to Tamilnadu’s
educational milieu, with its expansive quotas for Backward and Scheduled Castes. This IIT aspiration, he told me, had dovetailed with “a
Brahmin culture of coaching.” I quote him here at length:

I feel that paying for classes is a culture. IIT coaching— the idea that

you have to pay money to get in, and that it is valuable whether or

not you get into IIT— has sunk into the Brahmin community because

they’ve been doing this for very long. Many students— their parents

have gone for UPSC classes and now they go to IIT classes, so it is
almost a no- brainer for them. They will go. For the Backward Caste

students, this is the frst time they are even thinking along these

lines. Should I invest so much— I will invest in ten other things, but

should we invest in this or not—is more a cultural question than a
utility question. The richer sections [of the Backward Castes] are
more in tune with that. I don’t think the culture has yet set in across

the Backward Caste community. It will take time.

Madhavan’s insight into this “caste culture” illuminates a long-

standing Tamil Brahmin orientation around examinations and coaching
that extends back to the heyday of the UPSC exam to enter the central


-----

184 THE CASTE OF MERIT

government ser vices. Just as many parents attended coaching classes

to prepare for the UPSC exam, now their children do so with the JEE.

Indeed, this was the pattern in Madhavan’s own family. His parents

entered the central government ser vices by passing the UPSC exam,

as a result of which Madhavan studied in Central Board of Secondary
Education (CBSE) schools, where the vast majority of students were

Tamil Brahmins like himself.

Not only did Madhavan attribute the greater propensity of Brah-

mins to attend JEE coaching classes to a “caste culture,” but he has
responded by making sure that his classes are relevant to both the JEE
and the CBSE examination. In fact, he refers to his classes as “CBSE-
plus- IIT training.” Why, I asked him, did he single out the CBSE?

Because, he told me, the vast majority of IIT aspirants in Chennai were

from CBSE schools. By way of example, he gestured to his own schooling
in Chennai’s DAV Boys Se nior Secondary School, a CBSE institute

where a sizable percentage of students are Tamil Brahmins. “I would
say about three- fourths of my class would go for JEE coaching,” he told

me, “and those who didn’t still studied for the JEE at home. We had

about 50 students or so in my class section at that time and, except for
10 students, every one else studied for and took the JEE. And out of 80

students, out of those seriously writing the JEE, 40 of us got into IIT.”

Given these numbers, it made sense to Madhavan to cater to this con-

stituency. Besides, he told me, his classes tended to attract a self-
selecting type of student, one who was more concerned with “learning
concepts and not just doing prob lems.” Although over the years he

has capitulated to the demand that he teach more to the test and now
regularly assigns worksheets, his constituency has remained fairly
consistent.

What was the cost of his coaching classes? Madhavan charged what

he told me was the standard rate for boutique classes: 20,000 rupees
(approximately US$300) for one subject for eleventh and twelfth graders;
15,000 rupees (US$222) for tenth graders; and 11,000 rupees (US$163)
for ninth graders. Most took physics, chemistry, and mathe matics, the

three subjects tested in the JEE, which added up to between 33,000 and
60,000 rupees (US$490– $900) per year. These rates, while high, are

much lower than some of the corporate coaching centers that charge
up to 400,000 rupees (US$6,000) per year.


-----

TESTING MERIT 185

Although Madhavan caters to a distinct constituency and charges

relatively affordable rates for coaching, he admitted that the scaling up
of coaching has had an effect. “Many of these coaching classes, par-

ticularly the Kota / Andhra model, shifted what we were doing,” he told

me. “I felt the pressure, a lot of other teachers felt the pressure. For me,
it was okay for a long time not to worry about it, but now I have a lot
more worksheets, and practice, and— _ithai maadhuri prob_ _lem four_

_poddu_ [do prob lem 4 like this]. We have more and more classes which

are making kids do pattern recognition.” He bemoaned this shift from
“frst understanding the philosophy and then doing the practice” but

acknowledged that it was the natu ral result of a “hyped up system.”

With any system that acquires this kind of hype, he rationalized,
“ people will fgure out a way of breaking it. Do you need to really un-

derstand concepts to crack the JEE? No. That’s what these coaching

classes have proved. Now the teachers who were earlier saying, let me

understand and help, they started fnding that their students weren’t

doing any better than the Kota / Andhra students. So, they thought,
why should I waste all this time trying to make them understand? Let
me also start shifting.”

This sense of a decline in standards— a kind of downward spiral

from the conceptual to the rote— has permeated the feld of boutique

coaching. Even as “star teachers” like Madhavan adjust their methods,
they try to maintain distinctions between their own students and those

of the “coaching factories.” While distinctions in training are undeniable, the discourse around them is also an exercise in social boundary
making, intended to reinforce the meritocratic value of the exceptional
“boutique” student over the generic “factory” student. As we see from
the social profle of students in Chennai’s boutique classes, this exercise in boundary making is also very much one of caste distinction,
which reproduces the Brahmin– non- Brahmin binary.

_JEE Coaching and the Politics of School Boards in Tamilnadu_

What about Madhavan’s students? How do they position themselves
within the universe of JEE coaching? Speaking with his coaching class
students, it became evident that the distinction between “the gifted”
and “the coached” predates arrival at the IITs. As we heard from
Madhavan, most of his students are from schools that fall under the


-----

186 THE CASTE OF MERIT

CBSE. This is not just an institutional designation. In Tamilnadu, and
more specifcally in Chennai, the difference between schools that administer the central and state board examinations carries a power ful

symbolic charge, as it maps quite explic itly onto upper and lower

caste. For most of Madhavan’s students, being a CBSE student was a
collective identity and a point of pride. It was a way of marking themselves as more conceptually oriented and, by extension, more suited
for the IITs.

Tamil Brahmin affinity with the CBSE and with IIT Madras is in

part a response to the politics of Non- Brahminism and to the expanding

scope of Tamilnadu’s reservation system, something that I consider at
length in Chapter 6. It also comes out of a longer history of pan- Indian

mobility and national education. Since the nineteenth century, Tamil

Brahmins leveraged their cultural capital as knowledge bearers to move

from the countryside to the city and outside the region for employment.
Tamil Brahmin exodus from rural to urban areas, and beyond Madras
Presidency, was accelerated by a sense of victimization by the Non-
Brahmin and Dravidian movements, especially their role in advancing
communal quotas for non- Brahmins in public education and regional

government jobs. For the vast majority of Tamil Brahmins, the UPSC
exam was their ticket out of regional and into central government employment. As a result of their conscription into the central government bureaucracy, Tamil Brahmins are overrepresented in schools that
follow the curriculum set by the CBSE, rather than state or regional
boards. Many attend government- run CBSE schools that cater to

children of the national civil ser vices, guaranteeing them a seat regard-

less of frequent interregional transfers. [53] Others send their children to

private schools, which also offer the CBSE exam. These schools state

as one of their key missions “to develop the spirit of national integration and create a sense of ‘Indianness’ among children.” [54] The notion

of “Indianness” gestures to a cosmopolitan subjectivity that is supraregional and supracaste. At the same time, in the Tamil context, the
distinction between the regional / state board and the national / central

board maps discursively onto low and upper caste and has become the
basis for claims to intellectual merit.

The assumption that the CBSE curriculum produces “thinking

students” who are better suited to intellectual life in general and the

IITs in par tic u lar was conveyed to me across a wide swathe of inter-

views with CBSE teachers, administrators, and students. Person after

person distinguished the CBSE’s “conceptual training” from the “rote
learning” in the state boards. It was this training, they argued, that
made their students a natu ral ft for the IITs. One principal told me that

his school sends an average of ffteen to eigh teen students each year to

IIT Madras. It was not merely the affinity between the CBSE and the
JEE that made these feeder schools for the IITs. The schools specifcally

tailor their CBSE exam preparation in such a way that it dovetails with
the JEE curriculum. As we heard from Madhavan, the more exclusive
coaching classes in Chennai also follow suit.

CBSE schools are not only set apart as conceptually oriented. Like

IIT Madras, they are also marked as upper- caste enclaves in the city.

Udhay, another 1990s IIT Madras alumnus who now conducts JEE
coaching classes, told me about his experience of moving from a state
to a CBSE school. “I could see a huge shift when I went to Padma Seshadri,” he told me. “Every body talked about IIT, breathed IIT.” Plus,

the social composition of the student body was strikingly dif fer ent. “I

can’t think of too many non- Brahmins who were there,” Udhay re-

called. “It was very homogenous that way. Clearly upper caste, plus
it’s a more Hindu school. So the prayers and every thing were Hindu

prayers and all that. And you wouldn’t fnd many Christians. Of course,

Muslims were unheard of.” Madhavan had a similar description of his

alma mater, the DAV Boys Se nior Secondary School. That, too, was pre-

dominantly Brahmin and oriented around IIT aspiration. The school
even held a Hindu _puja_ before the annual JEE.

I conducted group interviews with students in some of Madhavan’s

JEE coaching classes in Chennai. The overwhelming majority were

Tamil Brahmins who went to CBSE schools where there was a com-

monsense assumption that they would take the JEE and gain admission to the IITs. Many conveyed a strong conviction of the natu ral ft

between CBSE schools and the IITs because of their shared commit-

ment to “conceptual training.” Many also contrasted their own intellectual formation to the inferior training received at state board schools,
from which far fewer students went to the IITs.

Let us look at a set of curated comments by Madhavan’s coaching

class students about the two school boards.

188 THE CASTE OF MERIT

as: What schools do students in your coaching class come from?

student 1: Shankara, DAV, Padma Seshadri, Kendriya Vidyalaya.

as: Are these all Central Board schools?

student 1: Yeah. From any metric [state board] school, we’ll have

maximum of one student per class. Even IIT Madras, you’ll have
maximum of one or two students, not more than that. Every body

else will be from CBSE only.

as: What’s the difference between the training in the state and

central boards?
student 2: In metric, the exam paper and the textbook are exactly

the same. You just have to mug up [memorize] and take the exam.
But in the Central Board, you have to concentrate in classes because

the teachers tell you more than what’s in the books. In metric, you
can pass and get good marks without the help of teachers because the

books are more than enough.
as: Do you think that the Central Board prepares you better for the

JEE?
student 3: Yeah, it does, defnitely. Up to tenth standard we were

all studying together and in the eleventh, a few guys went to metric.
Now, they’re coming and saying, why did we go there?

student 4: I was going to take metric, but then I spoke to the

se niors and they were like, if you take metric you will just not be

able to cope up with IIT questions. It’ll be so hard, it’ll be so differ ent. There, you’ll have to mug [memorize] but in the JEE, you’ll

have to think, and you won’t be able to do both. You can’t mug in the

morning and be applying concepts in the eve ning.

as: So are you planning to also do the entrance exam for Anna

University [the regional engineering university]?
student 5: No, at Anna University, you need your board marks and

it’s very hard to get into because state [board] students, they don’t

have much to read, they just mug up the book with questions and
score 100 percent, whereas in CBSE we have hard prob lems.

as: So Anna doesn’t differentiate between state board and central

board?
STUDENT 5: No, it’s just marks, the percentage, which is why the

metric students can get in.

TESTING MERIT 189

This palpable sense of the difference in school boards and their cor-

relation with kinds of training was also echoed by alumni. Here are

three alumni perspectives on this issue, the last one from a lower- caste

state board alumnus who echoes the sentiment about the dif fer ent

training received at the state and central board schools:

alumnus 1: I was from the central board which is not so lenient—

so we knew we were up against the wall. So we had to work rather

hard. So, to be honest with you, at one point we thought that JEE or
nothing else because our board scores usually never matched up to

what the state board students got.
alumnus 2: This is just my perception, but most non- Brahmins

would not send their kids to central board schools, and I think this
was because they would think that scoring marks is tougher in cen-

tral board.
alumnus 3 (from state board): JEE was intense. So, unless you are

really, really bright and don’t need to apply yourself, getting in would

require enormous application. So, if you take Padma Seshadri Bala
Bhavan [central board school], there would be 20 guys coming into

IIT per year. I was the only guy who joined from my [state board]
school. That was an anomaly, because if you take fve years after and

fve years before I entered, nobody went from my school.

For these coaching class students and IIT alumni, a CBSE educa-

tion does not merely reference a kind of training; it also indexes a regional caste landscape where the school boards map onto upper caste
and lower caste and associated intellectual abilities. As with the JEE,
there is an interplay here between ascription and achievement. While

CBSE schooling formally extends a certifcate of achievement, it also
tacitly certifes upper- caste culture.

The symbolic association of CBSE schooling with upper- caste con-

ceptual rigor helps to explain why, in the face of the crisis produced
by the coaching industry, IIT Madras faculty proposed prioritizing the
school board examination as the princi ple basis of admission. Unlike

regional engineering colleges, however, the type of school board would
also factor into the evaluation. As with the reform efforts linking the

colonial ICS exam more closely with an Oxbridge education, the proposal to shift the relative weight of the JEE and the school boards in


-----

190 THE CASTE OF MERIT

the IIT admissions pro cess was aimed at securing the link between the

CBSE and the IITs. With more and more students from Kota and Hyderabad defying expectations of who properly belongs in the IITs, these

attempts to elevate “the gifted” over “the coached” have resorted to
older caste landscapes of education as a means to produce the intended
outcomes of the JEE.

_The_ _Mental and the Manual . . ._ _Redux_

While across Chennai, the legacy of Non- Brahminism continues to

structure practices of distinction and forms of collective affiliation
around the JEE, within IIT Madras other forms of differentiation have
also come into play. Campus life produces not only an equation between Tamil Brahmins and intellectual merit but schisms between
upper- caste urban En glish speakers, who come from histories of edu-

cation, and upper castes from other backgrounds, whose presence
makes more tenuous the association between upper casteness, conceptual ability, and merit.

The most rapidly expanding group of students on campus are from

the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Ever since their capital
city of Hyderabad began to double as a JEE coaching capital in the early
2000s, the number of IIT aspirants from the state has risen sharply,
with a majority of successful students opting for IIT Madras in neighboring Tamilnadu over more distant campuses. 55 The expanded scale
of coaching has brought in students from small towns and rural parts
of the state who belong to landed upper castes, such as the Kammas
and the Reddys. These are families without the same histories of edu-

cational capital who now aspire to give their children opportunities on

par with the urban intelligent sia. In producing differences among upper

castes, their presence has troubled the easy distinction between upper
and lower. Unlike in greater Chennai, where the coaching industry reinscribes the divide between Brahmin and non- Brahmin, the presence

of students from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana within IIT Madras destabilizes the very notion of what it means to be upper caste.

I asked former IIT Madras director M. S. Ananth whether he thought

the expansion of coaching had changed the kind of student who attends
the IIT. “ There has been a change,” he acknowledged.


-----

TESTING MERIT 191

I would say a fraction of them are still the same, exactly as they were,

the bright ones, motivated, who are a joy to teach, they still exist.
But there is about 15–20 percent of students who are either burned

out, or who have come through these coaching classes and think they

have arrived already. They don’t think they need to make an effort,

they think they’ll anyway get a degree and a job, simply because they

are IITians. That fraction alarms me, because that is a sort of infec-

tion. It can spread. What you need is a collection of people who will

reinforce each other’s thinking in terms of values. [56]

While he acknowledged that this cavalier attitude toward an IIT edu-

cation is not limited to students from Hyderabad or Kota, it was this

subset that he singled out for comment. It was they who embodied a
kind of intellectual inertia and premature sense of arrival that he feared
would “infect” their peers, precipitating a downward spiral of declining
standards.

The term “infection” is a striking meta phor indeed. It casts “the

coached” as an alien intrusion in the corporate institutional body that
threatens to weaken it from within. The ex- director was not alone in

holding this opinion. Such sentiments and concerns about “the coached”
are also echoed by alumni. Chatterjee, an alumnus from the 1980s
who is now a professor at MIT, noted that IIT alumni currently doing

their PhDs under him described peers who had come through four

years of coaching as “just so intellectually tired that they didn’t work

very hard in IITs.” This was not the fault of the institutions, Chatterjee
quickly added, because “the IITs cannot provide a value system that

society does not by and large have. . . . I mean, there were a few profes-

sors at IIT who did a very good job of teaching us, okay? There were a

few of them that took personal interest in some of us and so forth and
so on. But that’s not why IIT was great at the time. It was because of

students and their interaction with each other.”

What do we make of this sense of an erosion of values and its threat

to the collective enterprise of peer learning and exceptional ambition?
What values are supposedly in decline because of the coaching industry

and its “burned out” products?

The key value that alumni and administrators identify as under

threat is that of engineering education as a pro cess of holistic intellectual


-----

192 THE CASTE OF MERIT

formation. Many spoke of “coaching factory” students as overly instrumental in their approach to the IITs and attributed this to a fundamentally dif fer ent orientation toward knowledge. Chatterjee recalled

that when he went back to receive the Distinguished Alumnus prize
at his alma mater, “the one thing the faculty complained about is that

the exam doesn’t test intrinsic intelligence anymore as much as it

tests how much practice you’ve had.” As we have seen many times

over, this is a well- worn contrast between knowledge as an expression

of innate conceptual intelligence and knowledge as a mechanistic,
embodied practice. The very notion of a “coaching factory” reinforces
this mind- body distinction: its students are likened to the mass-

produced commodities of the industrial shopfoor, which are defned
by their generic, unexceptional quality.

The mechanistic approach to knowledge bred by the coaching in-

dustry is associated with a narrowing of intellectual horizons. Shankar,
a professor in the Humanities Department at IIT Madras and a 1980s
alumnus, mentioned a debate competition for which he was one of
the judges. “We heard about 30 students do their 2- minute, 3- minute

speeches,” he recalled, “and we were shocked by the quality of debate. . . .

Some of them were reading off their notes and just the body language

and the ability to communicate seemed too inadequate.” I asked how
he squared this with the reigning assumption that IIT students are the
best of the best. “The best in some very structured, narrow way,” he
responded. “ They’ve been groomed for a par tic u lar exam. That’s what a

lot of people are lamenting right now: the loss of the well- rounded

individual.” [57]

Of course, “the well- rounded individual” is not just a victim of the

coaching industry. The compartmentalization of knowledge, as a result of which the humanities and social sciences are increasingly regarded as irrelevant to the making of the Indian engineer, has long been
in the making. Furthermore, the IIT system and its fetishized exam
have been key catalysts in this very pro cess of severing the technical

sciences from other branches of study. Yet the narrowing of intellectual horizons that has been a steady trend in postin de pen dence Indian

engineering is con ve niently transposed onto its latest, non- elite en-

trants. This, then, seems less a lament about the compartmentaliza-


-----

TESTING MERIT 193

tion of knowledge as such than about the threat posed by the expansion of the IIT student body beyond a desired constituency.

Faculty and administrators bemoan the narrow horizons of “the

coached” not just as evidenced in their approach to education but also
in their attitude toward future employment. As one administrator who

oversees the Alumni Office said ruefully, “Rote learning is the norm

[for them] and the IIT merely represents a paycheck and a local job for
life.” He worried that this new breed of student would mean fewer diasporic success stories of the kind that have become so emblematic of
IIT exceptionalism. “For cultural reasons, fewer of them go abroad,”
he elaborated, “and this will defnitely mean a decline from those days

when seventy percent of Silicon Valley companies had IITian names

on the board.” This presumed parochialism of “the coached” is contrasted to the long- [58] mobile upper- caste subject, with his pan- Indian and

now global affiliation.

Fi nally, these narrow horizons are seen to threaten not only the

career trajectories that have underpinned global brand value but the
campus culture as well. Students and alumni from across the past
ffteen years mentioned the parochial loyalties that students from
Andhra Pradesh had brought with them. Sudipta, a 2004 alumnus, put
it this way: “If you look for groupism in the campus, that is the only
form you will fnd it in, on the basis of language. There is a huge number

of people coming from Andhra Pradesh. You will fnd most of them

staying together. Other than that, there is no distinction.” [59] The region-

alism of Andhra students— especially their tendency to speak in their

native Telugu— came in for repeated mention as a violation of the IITs’

national and global ethos. Of course, Brahmin Tamil and Hindi are also
heard quite commonly on campus, and other forms of collectivity are
key to what it means to be a “real” IITian. I heard numerous stories of
male bonding over all- night debates on every thing from obscure math-

ematical formulas to the evidence of science in Sanskrit texts. Such
interactions take place in the dorm room and not the classroom and
mark a form of upper- caste homosociality. But it is only the use of

Telugu that is marked as an unacceptable form of parochialism that
violates campus social norms and is better suited to students at other
institutions.

194 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Lurking behind all this commentary on the decline of values seen

in the instrumentality and narrow horizons of “the coached” is an argument about the market. Despite the fact that all IITians pay money
for coaching classes, it is only in relation to “coaching factory” students that the market is identifed as an illegitimate mediator. Indeed,
it is strange to hear IIT administrators bemoaning the instrumentality
of “the coached” when one of the hallmark features of the IIT pedigree is its market value. After all, this is what is encapsulated in the

term “brand IIT.” But for them, the contrast between “the gifted” and
“the coached” seems to hinge on a perceived relationship between nonmarket and market value. “The coached” are deemed illegitimate
because they are seen as gaining admission to the IIT not through their
innate knowledge but because they paid money for coaching classes.

Their achievement is thus superfcial and not emblematic of their true
abilities. While they are pure creatures of the market, “the gifted” have
“raw intelligence” that is recognized but not produced by the market.
Through this shadow play between market and nonmarket value, the
intimacy between achievement and ascription is reinstated and “true”
merit denied to students from Andhra Pradesh.

In sum, Telugu students are seen as problematic because they are

the wrong kind of upper caste. Their unfamiliarity with En glish and

their open embrace of regionalism are at odds with the cosmopolitan
intellectualism that is supposed to distinguish upper from lower. How
did those designated as “the coached” experience the coaching in-

dustry? How did their time at IIT Madras affect their sense of self and
standing? And to what extent did they internalize or contest pejorative assessments of their merit?

_The Coached_

In the 2000s, the number of students from Andhra Pradesh began to
rise steadily. While a few had come from other coaching centers, the
foodgates opened when the Sri Chaitanya and Narayana franchises
took off. Begun in 1986, the Sri Chaitanya franchise has expanded to
250 institutions across nine states. The Narayana group started in 1980
and has grown steadily to its current scale, comprising over 200 schools,
400 ju nior colleges, 9 professional colleges, and 500 coaching centers

spread over thirteen states. Not only have these franchises expanded


-----

TESTING MERIT 195

geo graph i cally, but they’ve also moved lower and lower down the edu-

cational ladder. Now they offer students the option of beginning college examination training as early as the sixth grade.

Abbas, a 2016 IIT Madras alumnus from Andhra Pradesh, spoke to

me about his time in the Sri Chaitanya coaching center and at IIT
Madras. He also offered an account of why the two franchises have
been able to monopolize the space of education in Andhra Pradesh
and Telangana and what the ramifcations have been for their students. Here, I use Abbas’s experiences and insights as a win dow onto

the “coaching factory” phenomenon. [60]

Abbas attended one of the Sri Chaitanya coaching centers from 2007

to 2009. He chose that par tic u lar center because of only one consider-

ation: its track rec ord of getting students into the IITs. His center hap-

pened to be the most coveted because of its phenomenal success rate;

just over Abbas’s two years there, approximately sixty students gained

admission to IIT Madras. But even this pales in comparison to what
followed. Abbas described his time at Sri Chaitanya as “a watershed,”
after which both coaching franchises expanded far more aggressively
into secondary school education. The expansion was not just down the
educational ladder; the franchises also ranged beyond cities into smaller
towns. “I come from a small town,” Abbas offered by way of example,
“and we have our own Chaitanya / Narayana schools there. We don’t

have Chaitanya / Narayana colleges, but we have schools.”

I asked Abbas what accounted for the timing of this expansion in

mass coaching. It was the change in the format of the IIT exam. “The
IIT entrance test was subjective before,” he explained. “When it was
subjective there were few pockets in Andhra Pradesh— like the Ra-

maiah coaching center in Hyderabad— which used to be popu lar, but

Sri Chaitanya and Narayana were not that popu lar. They were not

known to send so many students into the IITs. But once the exam became objective, it became easier for the sort of training they give to be
very effective at getting students into IITs. What you do is practice so
much that it becomes very easy to actually crack the exam. And that
was what turned the wheel.” The new format of the exam allowed
coaching centers to chalk up more successes, which in turn attracted
increasing numbers of people to them. Abbas narrated this shift as a

sea change in aspiration. “The IITs were always famous, always had


-----

196 THE CASTE OF MERIT

some kind of an aura,” he acknowledged. “When students go to IIT,
they settle well, they get good jobs and good life, and all that.” But, he

went on, “it was inaccessible. What people thought was, it was only

for geniuses.” The coaching industry changed that impression by
making the IITs “not so distant anymore. They were now within

reach.” When people saw that there was a real chance of getting into

one of these prestigious institutes, they “refused to settle for something

local.” And this, he underscored, made the IITs less of a purely urban,
purely English- speaking phenomenon, with “more and more people at-

tempting the exam from distant, remote areas.” It also helped that the
centers trained students with an eye to placing them in one of a range
of institutions. While most did not end up at the IITs, their training
qualifed them for a number of other lower- tier institutions, such as

the regional engineering colleges.

Who, I pressed, were these “ people” for whom the IITs had recently

become an imaginable ambition? Coaching is now “across the board,”
he explained, “as long as you have money to access it. With the change
in the exam format and the expansion of coaching centers, Abbas continued, “all the land owning castes from Andhra— the Kammas and

Reddys who had money and power but not education— they started

coming in huge numbers. There are lots of Reddy and Kamma students

now who come from Andhra into IITs.”

In one sense, then, the coaching franchises have demo cratized ac-

cess to the IITs, at least for rural landowners. By doing so, they have

challenged the prevalence of upper castes with histories of educational
capital. For Abbas, this was an impor tant counter to the doom- and-

gloom story prevalent among IIT faculty and administrators. “Yeah,
in a sense, the culture of IIT is changing,” he acknowledged. “This is
something that IIT professors and administrators frmly believe. They
say that when the exam was subjective, we used to get only people who

were deserving, who really had merit. Once it became objective there

was so much infux from these coaching factories that the standard of

IIT decreased. They feel that these people didn’t deserve to be here and

they were not eager to study once they got to IIT because, after working

so much in the two years before, they just let go.” After rehearsing the

string of criticisms typically leveled against “coaching factory” students, Abbas continued that “ there is a hint of truth to this, but the


-----

TESTING MERIT 197

place it is coming from . . . I’m not sure if that is what we should focus

on.” After all, he said, trying to be tactful, “before the exam was ob-

jective, IIT was mostly a . . . it was a lot of . . . there was a consider-

ably larger number of Brahmins in IITs.” To the extent that it forced a
change in the social profle of the IITs, Abbas felt the coaching industry
was a good thing. For him, the expansion of access mattered far more

than the concern over diminishing standards, which, he felt, was more
an alibi to keep the campuses socially exclusive.

But Abbas also pointed to the coaching franchises’ own mecha-

nisms of internal stratifcation:

Earlier, when they were not so famous, you just had to pay money.

Not now. Now you have to qualify for entry by taking an exam and
there are dif fer ent levels of coaching they give depending on your

marks. It’s not your choice anymore. They have the say. They will

decide whether your child is suitable for IIT, whether he can go for

IIT, or whether he doesn’t have the required skills to do it. They will

decide and place you in a section. So and so sections get this kind of
training, so and so sections get this kind of training. They have it all
worked out about what kind of training to give to which kind of
student.

The intensely competitive environment has also generated hostili-

ties within the big coaching centers between upper- caste students who

aim for admission in the “general category” and lower- caste students

who are eligible for quotas. At one level, it was understandable, Abbas
acknowledged:

General category students are so frustrated with what is happening—
because it’s not an easy thing to study for 12 hours and all that—

that they look with envy at OBC and SC / ST students. They think,

you know, these people can just chill out, even if they score less they

will get a better branch than me or get a better IIT than me. And this
feeling is carried into the IITs. They look at that person and think,
he was in a section lower than me at the coaching center and now he
is in a better branch than me.

Abbas summed up the larger structure of competitive ranking with
this observation: “It’s almost like a mini caste system, you know? The
central board Brahmins look down on the Andhra bunch. Within the


-----

198 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Andhra bunch, higher castes look down on the quota students. You
have hierarchies, one beneath the other.”

Abbas did not contest criticisms of the coaching factory as a site

for rote learning or as indicative of the intensifed commodifcation of
education. At the same time, his own concerns came from a distinctly
dif fer ent vantage point from those leveled by more socially elite IITians.

For him, the prob lem with the coaching industry was not its effect on

merit but its crippling intensity and regional mono poly of secondary

education. Even while it has opened access to those who previously

could not have conceived of trying for the IITs, it has imprisoned an
entire generation of students in brutally exacting regimes of study.

Abbas spoke to me at length about how time is or ga nized at Sri

Chaitanya coaching centers. Classes started at 6:00 a.m. and went until

noon, followed by individual study hours from 2:00 p.m. until 10:00

p.m. This routine went on for fourteen months, at which point the
students would complete the syllabus for the eleventh and twelfth
grades. In the remaining ten months, they had exclusive study hours
from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., with thirty- to sixty- minute lunch and

snack breaks, and approximately twenty to twenty- fve exams per

week. Not only were they trapped in this monotonous routine, but

they were physically enclosed within the campus and let out only once

in two weeks for a day’s “outing.” The outing day was quite the spectacle. “ You’re let out and you just fall upon the city,” Abbas recalled

with horror. “The whole city is blocked, you know, the buses and every-

thing. There are so many centers, and all of the students are let loose at

the same time, and there are crazy lines in front of the movie theaters,

in front of the restaurants.” Abbas highlighted the contrast between
the chaos of outing day and the strict discipline of coaching center life,
where interaction with the opposite sex was virtually forbidden. “You
actually weren’t allowed to talk to women,” Abbas explained. “If you

talked, you would be penalized because it’s supposedly the age people

waver. So we are not supposed to have any interaction with women stu-

dents, so that we don’t get disturbed by . . . things. Yeah, those are the

words we were told.” In fact, the center was so “removed from social

real ity” that he “ didn’t know that 26 / 11 happened” till he left for

home. [61] Refecting on the experience, Abbas paused and said slowly,
“It really was like a prison.”


-----

TESTING MERIT 199

As with prisons, the relentless pressure with little outlet often led

to mental health prob lems. In the middle of his second year at Sri Chai-

tanya, Abbas confded, “something went wrong, I broke. I was just
feeling so suffocated, but no one understood, not my parents or the college. They just gave me a 5- day break. I was struggling but, you know,

there was nothing much I could do. This seemed like the only option.
This is what you’ve worked for all your life, and you don’t want to

throw it away. So I strug gled in the last few months leading up to the

exam.” By the end of the second year, Abbas experienced a serious deterioration in his health. He became depressed and developed symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder, although it wasn’t diagnosed

until after he’d left the center. In the end, after two years of endless

work, he got into IIT Madras but was too preoccupied with his mental

prob lems to experience any satisfaction, let alone elation. “ There was

a kind of indifference that I developed after two years,” he said. “It

didn’t matter anymore what I was doing.”

In a sense, the experience of the “coaching factory” has made its

students impervious to the criticisms they face at IIT Madras about
their lack of merit. Abbas acknowledged that there are constant dis-

tinctions drawn between “the Andhra way” and more “legitimate”
ways of gaining admission. He even indicated that most of his peers
from Andhra agreed with these assessments. “All of us were aware that

what they’re saying was true,” Abbas told me. “We agreed that [the

coaching centers] were factories, we agreed that there was rote learning.

But what we felt was, that’s what my life is, there’s nothing I can do

about it, it was that kind of emotion. The conversation didn’t move be-

yond that. If we resented how we were perceived, then that would be-

come a confict— but there was no confict as such.”

Instead, students from Andhra found comfort in numbers. “ There

was no sense of isolation,” Abbas said. “No feeling that this person is
attacking me because, you know, you just turn to this side or that side,

and every body is the same as you. People who come from such facto-

ries, we are now the majority.” Moreover, there was a strong sense of

community among students from Andhra’s coaching centers. “When
it comes to coaching centers,” he explained, “ there was a sense of com-

munity despite caste tensions. This is a person from this place, this is
someone from my turf, that kind of a thing.”


-----

200 THE CASTE OF MERIT

I pointed out that this collective solidarity was a source of griev-

ance for other IITians I had interviewed, who equated it with a form of
regional parochialism unsuited to a national institute. In response,
Abbas acknowledged that most students from Andhra tended to speak
in Telugu and stick together. At frst, he attributed this to the single-
minded focus on technical training inculcated in coaching centers.
“We who come from Andhra coaching centers, we have neglected all
other subjects,” he bemoaned. “ Because this was not a normal educa-

tion we got. We were solely focusing on maths, physics and chemistry.

So we were not really being trained in anything else. There has never

really been an application of other subjects within our clique.” From
this critique of narrowed intellectual horizons, Abbas then resorted to
a dif fer ent argument. “We talk in Telugu,” he proposed, “ because there

are so many of us, there is not really a necessity to try to speak in any

other language.” Besides, he pointed out, it was not a choice for those

who were not comfortable in En glish:

If you come from a family which spoke En glish, if you had a circle of

friends with whom you spoke En glish before coming to IIT— I mean,

basically city people— those people had no prob lem mingling with

other IITians. They could easily shift languages. Among other students who come from towns and villages, who didn’t have any sub-

stantial En glish language training, they would suffer a bit, they

would have some discomfort. I mean the conversation could still
happen, but it would not be as the other person expects it to be, it
won’t be as smooth. He will obviously spot grammar mistakes and

all that.

We might think of Abbas’s explanation of Telugu “groupism” as an account of regional solidarity. Even as he indicted the structural hierarchies of Indian education that subjected students like him to the extreme pressures of the coaching industry, Abbas valorized the forms
of collective identifcation and support that such experiences generated.
For students like himself, strength in numbers was what got them
through their IIT years and allowed them to disregard accusations of
intellectual inferiority. It also allowed them to transform campus
culture from its erstwhile grounding in upper- caste, cosmopolitan

nationalism. Now, Telugu students are a counterforce to contend with


-----

in student body elections, where they vote as a bloc, and in campus
events where they insist on their presence as a regionally defned
constituency.

At the end of the interview, I asked Abbas if he thought mass

coaching was in sum a good or a bad thing. “I still strug gle to come to

terms with it,” he confessed, “ because I am a frst generation college

student. My father was the frst in his family to get a school education

so this was something very prestigious for him, you know? His son
going to a college— you know it was something that happens once in a

blue moon in communities like ours.” His family, Abbas elaborated,

were Muslim jute bag weavers from rural Andhra Pradesh, who never
benefted from formal education. Their social marginality was exacerbated by spatial marginality; his family lived in a Muslim majority

town called Tulukabad, which translated as “village of Turks.” When
Abbas’s father completed eighth grade, he refused to stop studying and

join the trade. As a result, he was turned out of the house. He man-

aged to educate himself and to instill in his son the value of education. “So education was something very big for him, for me, for every one

in the family,” Abbas affirmed. “But this is not the way. Because

we— all of us— the coaching centers were literally torture for all of us.

And that is being normalized.” I asked Abbas whether his father un-

derstands what he went through. “Yes,” he replied. “He does. The thing

is, many people see this as inhumane. But they feel helpless. They say,

what else can one do? Because this is shown as the only way your kid

can get to any of these colleges, any of these prestigious universities.”

Now that Abbas has been to an IIT, he is routinely approached for advice. “And this is a tension that I face,” he admitted. “Someone in
10th standard from a lower- caste or Muslim background comes to us,

comes to my father or to me for advice. I don’t know what to tell that

person. I know he’ll go through a lot of torture if I say study there, but

if he doesn’t do that, he’s just left nowhere.” The coaching centers have

so thoroughly monopolized the educational arena in Andhra Pradesh
and Telangana that the only alternative, Abbas said, would be to study
in “bad colleges which don’t have much faculty or much infrastruc-

ture which is what eco nom ically weaker sections do.” For the middle

class, he concluded, this is the only alternative. Even though coaching
sends most middle- class families into debt, the promise of a well- paying

202 THE CASTE OF MERIT

job makes it seem like a worthwhile investment, “a shortcut, you know,
to settle well.”

I asked Abbas if he ever took his criticisms of the coaching industry

to IIT administrators, whose own concerns partially dovetailed with
his. “They don’t care but they should,” he said, “ because a lot of crimes

are committed in their name, locking students in for two years, having
a 16- hour study day. They created the myth of the IITs and others per-

fectly capitalized on that my thol ogy through the coaching centers.

Now, the image that was always there of IIT within the public, the

image that they helped to cultivate, it was inaccessible for a long time,
and now that it has become accessible, there’s a huge storm and you

can’t stop it.”

�

As we have seen throughout this chapter, the examination in India has
always staged a dialectic between ascription and achievement. From
the ICS exam to the IIT- JEE, the modern examination has functioned

as a putatively demo cratizing mea sure for testing individual achieve-

ment to the exclusion of other, ascriptive criteria. When one looks more
closely at the social effects of such exams, however, their role in gatekeeping, cultural certifcation, and ranking comes into view. As with
efforts to maintain certain race and class criteria for the ICS, the IIT JEE has also been subject to reform when people who do not ft the

profle of the “gifted” IITian— urban, mobile, En glish educated, upper

caste— gain admission to the IITs. Efforts to stabilize the boundary be-

tween “the gifted” and “the coached” occur at every point along the

pathway into the IITs. As Bourdieu and Passeron point out, most poor
and lower- caste students are eliminated from the very “possibilities of

candidature.” [62] Among those who can afford coaching classes, there are

other mechanisms of distinction. “Boutiques” are distinguished from
“factories.” “Coaching factory” students are typecast as parochial, instrumental, and unmeritorious. In these ways, the examination pro-

duces merit not as the index of individual ability but as a modern expression of caste and class difference. As we have seen from Abbas’s
story, the examination is also an incorporative force— “a huge storm”—

that, even while it expands access to elite institutional spaces like the
IITs, eliminates other approaches to knowledge, value, and a life worth


-----

TESTING MERIT 203

living. In the pro cess, students like Abbas become victims of caste and

class hierarchies of value and a profteering industry that seduces with
the promise of mobility while reinforcing older assumptions of social
and intellectual inferiority.

We have seen how the coaching industry challenged the relation-

ship of ascription and achievement through the market. In response,
upper- caste IITians engaged in maneuvers of vari ous kinds to distin-

guish themselves as “the gifted.” This dialectic between new claims
to access and efforts to retrench upper- caste meritocracy created dis-

tinctions between the “right” and the “wrong” upper castes. We will

now turn to another challenge to upper- caste meritocracy advanced not

through the market but through the law. Chapter 6 delves into the history of India’s affirmative action system and its impact on the dialectics of caste and the meanings of meritocracy. How, we will ask, did

the extension of quotas for lower castes redraw the lines of opposition?
What did upper castes do in response? And how did Tamilnadu fgure
in this evolving set of dynamics? Let us now turn to the transformations of caste through the politics of affirmative action.


-----

#### Contesting Reservation

I n some re spects, affirmative action—or reservation, as it is known

in India— was a more fundamental challenge than the coaching in-

dustry to the IITs’ claim to meritocracy. The reservation system recognized how enduring forms of structural in equality shape differen-

tial access to education and the need for redistributive mea sures to

level the playing feld. It acknowledged caste discrimination as the
basis of nonachievement. At the same time, it left unnamed caste inheritances as the basis of achievement. This imbalance between
naming caste as a factor on one side and not naming it on the other

has reinforced the representative status of upper castes as subjects
whose merit is purely the result of talent, not history. In this sense,
reservation policy, too, was only a partial critique of meritocracy.

What the law left unnamed, however, politics did not. The naming

of caste capital as the basis of achievement was especially voluble in
Tamilnadu and other regions with power ful movements for caste

rights. As we saw in Chapter 3, Non- Brahminism and Dravidianism

marked Brahmins in par tic u lar as benefciaries of caste, leading to the

early implementation of quotas in education and employment. These

po liti cal challenges produced a more symmetrical analy sis of caste by

illuminating its relationship to both nonachievement and achievement. With the advent of in de pen dence, Tamil Brahmins adopted two

strategies. First, as citizens of a liberal democracy, they made recourse

204


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 205

to the Constitution’s baseline of equality and nondiscrimination to
challenge reservation. But they also argued that, as Brahmins, they
were quintessentially meritocratic. This interplay between their civic
unmarking as liberal demo cratic citizens and their cultural marking as

caste subjects has given Tamil Brahmin claims to merit both a universalistic and an identitarian character. As we will see, what began as a

Tamil Brahmin reaction to regional po liti cal transformation has now

proliferated nationally. With the rise of Other Backward Class (OBC)
politics in the northern “Hindi belt” and the implementation of OBC

quotas in 1990 and 2006, claims to merit have not only proliferated but
come to express newly consolidated forms of upper- caste affiliation.

In this chapter, we will look at how the structuring force of caste

in education was addressed within the domains of postin de pen dence

law and policy. We will also see that Tamilnadu plays an impor tant

role as an outlier to liberal constitutionalism where the legacy of regional politics is evident in the approach to reservation. How, we will

ask, did the shifting terrain of reservation policy shape the contours of
Tamil Brahmin and upper- caste affiliation at IIT Madras?

Caste and Citizenship

Within Indian modernization theory of the 1940s, caste was antithetical to modern social life and had no place within a demo cratic polity.

This was the promise of in de pen dence. At the stroke of the midnight

hour, the equal citizen was to take the place of the unequal subject. At
the same time, Indian statesmen acknowledged the per sis tence of so-

cial inequalities that needed redress by the state. B. R. Ambedkar, Dalit
lawyer and key architect of the Indian Constitution, was the most strident in his rejection of presumptive equality. In November 1949,
Ambedkar issued a warning to the Constituent Assembly: “On January 26, 1950, we will have equality in politics and in equality in so-

cial and economic life. We must remove this contradiction at the earliest moment, or else those who suffer from in equality will blow up

the structure of po liti cal democracy which this Assembly has so labo-

riously built up.” He further elaborated on the two forms of per sis tent

in equality: “On the social plane, we have in India a society based on

the princi ple of graded in equality which means elevation for some and


-----

206 THE CASTE OF MERIT

degradation for others. On the economic plane, we have a society in

which there are some who have im mense wealth as against many who

live in abject poverty.” [1]

There was general agreement in the assembly that the graded in-

equality of caste and the disparities of class demanded substantive redress. However, consensus broke down when it came to mechanisms
of redress. Two key points of debate emerged at the time, which have
been remarkably resilient. The frst concerned the relative weighting
of the fundamental right to equality and nondiscrimination and the
directive princi ple of redress for caste disabilities. The question of

whether implementing forms of redress was itself discriminatory and
a violation of the right to equality was and has remained hotly debated.
Despite acknowledging caste capital as a per sis tent form of structural

advantage requiring state intervention, statesmen and lawmakers
treated reservation as a temporary departure from a liberal baseline of
formal equality. Even Ambedkar, the most strident critic of the Indian
caste system, ultimately upheld the ideal of a liberal norm. Arguing
before the Constituent Assembly in November 1948, Ambedkar cautioned that the drafting committee had “to safeguard two things,

namely, the princi ple of equality of opportunity and at the same time

satisfy the demand of communities which have not had so far represen ta tion in the State.” [2] The solution he offered was to clearly delimit

the quota because “ unless you use some such qualifying phrase as

‘backward,’ the exception made in favor of reservation will ultimately

eat up the rule altogether. Nothing of the rule will remain.” [3] By dis-

tinguishing rule from exception, Ambedkar reinforced formal equality
as the necessary basis of constitutional law. The law still had to uphold the princi ple of “caste blind” equality even if society was far from

achieving this standard. The demographic calculus is key here: regard-

less of the actual distribution of power and resources, Ambedkar

maintained that only a minority could be covered by caste quotas.
Other wise, “nothing of the rule will remain.” As we will see, in future

judgments, the 50 percent ceiling on reservation was brought up repeat-

edly as the tipping point between (rational) law and (irrational) politics and became a key touchstone for antireservation activism.

The second point of debate was around the appropriate constitu-

tional language of social differentiation— specifcally, whether caste


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 207

should be accorded legal recognition. While caste classifcation was

deemed necessary for Scheduled Castes (SCs) suffering the stigma of
untouchability, there was far less consensus on how to classify the in-

termediate castes. Even Kaka Kalelkar, chair of the frst Backward
Classes Commission established in 1953, advised the president to reject his own commission’s recommendations because remedies on the

basis of caste would not be in the interest of society and country. Instead, he proposed that the princi ple of caste be eschewed altogether

in favor of other indices. The central government agreed with Kalelkar’s

objection and echoed his concern that recognizing “certain specifed
castes as backward may serve to maintain and perpetuate the existing
distinctions on the basis of caste.” A 1961 missive to regional state governments urged that “while the State Governments have the discretion to choose their own criteria for defning backwardness, in the view
of the Government of India it would be better to apply economic tests
than to go by caste.” [4]

We see in these concerns the palpable discomfort around acknowl-

edging the very forms of lived in equality that rendered equal citizen-

ship more aspirational than real. There was even a perverse twist of

logic whereby naming the prob lem itself became the prob lem. Three

Supreme Court judgments encapsulate this enduring tension between
the endorsement of formal equality and the recognition and redress of
substantive in equality: the 1951 Champakam Dorairajan case, the 1992

Indra Sawhney case, and the 2008 Ashoka Kumar Thakur case. The
frst challenged the constitutionality of the Madras Presidency’s 1921
Communal G.O. (Government Order) reserving seats in regional medical and engineering colleges on the basis of caste and religion. The
second challenged the reservation of 27 percent of central government

jobs for OBCs, as recommended by the government appointed Mandal
Commission. The third challenged the other part of Mandal, the reservation of 27 percent of seats for OBCs in all centrally funded educa-

tional institutions, including the IITs.

Across these three cases, we see shifts and continuities in the legal

landscape of reservation and in the framing of the debate. The courts
moved defnitively toward an embrace of reservation as a necessary

mechanism of recompense and re distribution. At the same time, the

focus on the appropriate criteria for determining “backwardness” left


-----

208 THE CASTE OF MERIT

largely unaddressed the social bases of merit. Even as more and more
ink was spilled in debating the caste versus class contours of historical disadvantage, the inheritances that underwrote merit slipped out
of view. The effects of this asymmetry are evident in the popu lar poli-

tics around reservation whereby the claim to merit on the part of upper
castes is taken largely at face value. While there were many other cases

on reservation, these three are particularly signifcant because each ad-

dressed a key site of upper- caste capital accumulation: regional gov-

ernment education (1951), central government jobs (1992), and central
government education (2008). The succession of cases also marks shifts
in the geography of accumulation from the regional to national state
and from the public to the private sector.

Across these cases, we see the consistent stance of the Tamilnadu

government as a po liti cal outlier. In refusing to accord the individual

citizen primacy over the caste collective, in opposing the coupling of
caste with class criteria, and in exceeding the 50 percent ceiling on res-

ervation, Tamilnadu disregarded the liberal norm of formal equality.
This has made Tamilnadu a pivot of antireservation arguments and
generated a unique antipathy between IIT Madras and the regional
polity. This is all the more so because Tamilnadu’s reservation system

has prioritized the rights of OBCs— the Shudras of Periyar’s Dravidian

collective. The steady growth in OBC quotas has redistributed positions in education and employment from upper to intermediate castes.
At the same time, it has had a more limited impact on those at the very

bottom of the caste ladder, and even exacerbated status conficts between intermediate castes and SCs. In this sense, Tamilnadu’s reservation system has kept in place the work of caste as a system of graded
in equality while enhancing opportunities for OBCs.

_1951:_ The State of Madras v. Srimathi Champakam Dorairajan

In 1950, two Tamil Brahmin petitioners, Champakam Dorairajan and
R. Srinivasan, appealed to the Madras High Court to protect their right
to equality and nondiscrimination. Both Dorairajan and Srinivasan argued that their fundamental rights as guaranteed under Article 15(1)

and Article 29(2) of the Constitution had been violated by the Com-

munal G.O., which mandated quotas in regional medical and engineering colleges. 5 Dorairajan had not actually applied for admission in


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 209

the Madras Medical College; however, she claimed that upon inquiry,
she had come to know that, as a Brahmin, she would not be admitted.
Srinivasan, on the other hand, had applied for and been denied admission to the College of Engineering, Guindy. In his affidavit, he claimed
that his marks in the school examination and the college admissions
test would have secured him admission “if se lections had been made

on merits alone.” [6]

The timing of this case signaled the effort by Tamil Brahmins to

take advantage of a new postin de pen dence po liti cal confguration. In

appealing to the Constitution, Dorairajan and Srinivasan sought the
support of the judiciary in checking the redistributive mea sures of the

Madras government and restoring their claim to regional education.
In its judgment, the Madras High Court responded as they had hoped.
It held that the Communal G.O. constituted a violation of the fundamental rights of citizenship guaranteed by the Constitution and shot
down the contention of the Madras government that Article 29(2)
needed to be read alongside Article 46, charging the state with promoting the educational and economic interests of “the weaker sections of the people.” [7] Instead, the court held that Article 46, which falls

under “Directive Princi ples” in Part IV of the Constitution, could not

in any way override or abridge the fundamental rights guaranteed by
Part III.

The language of the judgment both acknowledged and effaced in-

herited caste capital as the basis of citizenship rights. The judges argued that if se lection had been made solely on the basis of “merit,”

Brahmins would have obtained 249 seats out of the roughly 400 seats
in government engineering colleges instead of the 77 they were allotted

under the quota. Rather than proof of stark structural inequalities, the
court treated this calculus as evidence of injustice against Brahmins.
Consider this quote from the judgement:

It may be that through the fortuitous operation of a rule, which in
itself is not discriminatory, a special advantage is enjoyed by some
citizens belonging to a par tic u lar caste or community. This advan-

tage is not taken away by Article 15(1). If, for instance, students belonging to a certain community or caste by reason of their caste discipline, habits and modes of life, satisfy the prescribed requirements
in larger number than others, it is not permissible to shut them out


-----

210 THE CASTE OF MERIT

on that score. . . . It would be strange if, in this land of equality and

liberty, a class of citizens should be constrained to wear the badge of
inferiority because, forsooth, they have a greater aptitude for certain

types of education than other classes.

Here, we see how the “special advantage” enjoyed by Tamil Brahmins
is naturalized as caste culture and made consistent with the fundamental rights of citizenship. Even as caste is acknowledged, it is remade from a system of graded in equality into community life. By con-

trast, it is the quota as a mechanism of re distribution that is identifed

as a source of discrimination denying Brahmins their “greater aptitude
for certain types of education” and stigmatizing them as “inferior.”
The afterlife of this remarkable statement equating Tamil Brahmin
educational capital with the rights of citizenship and the quota system
with discrimination is still evident in upper- caste claims to merit. It

laid the groundwork for subsequent arguments about upper- caste rights

as consistent with demo cratic princi ples and lower- caste rights as a

violation of these princi ples. [8]

In April 1951, the Supreme Court upheld the verdict of the Madras

High Court. The unan i mous verdict of both courts in striking down

the Communal G.O. met with a swift response from Ambedkar and
Nehru. In June 1951, the First Amendment to Article 15 of the Constitution was passed, stating that “nothing in this Article or in Clause (2)
of Article 29 shall prevent the State from making any special provi-

sion for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward
classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.” [9]

The frst amendment signaled a standoff between the judiciary

and the national executive on the relationship between fundamental
rights and distributive justice. By the time of the next major reservation
battle in the 1990s, however, the courts had shifted toward a greater

recognition of quotas as a necessary precondition for equality. The intervening years also witnessed the consolidation of Dravidianist
rule in Tamilnadu and the increasing divergence between regional
and national stances on the caste question. Both trends were evi-

dent in the second landmark judgment on reservation: the 1992 Indra
Sawhney case.


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 211

_1992:_ Indra Sawhney v. Union of India

Between 1951 and 1991, the Government of India set up two commissions to investigate “the condition of the socially and educationally
backward classes.” As noted earlier, the frst Kaka Kalelkar Commis-

sion of 1953 was both ambivalent in its views and inconsequential in
its effects. This was not the case for the second B. R. Mandal Commission set up in 1979. Not only were its recommendations implemented

a de cade later, but “Mandal” has become a hugely controversial

house hold word in India.

The Mandal Commission picked up where the Kalelkar Commis-

sion left off. It developed a more comprehensive social scientifc methodology for determining social and educational backwardness and, on
that basis, recommended 27 percent reservation for OBCs in civil posts

and ser vices falling under the central government and in public sector

enterprises and banks. [10] When added to the already existing 22.5 percent

for SCs and Scheduled Tribes (STs), Mandal brought the total quota of
reserved seats to 49.5 percent, just under the Supreme Court limit of

50 percent.

There are four noteworthy points in the Mandal Commission’s re-

port. The frst relates to the social life of caste. The report cautions
against any hasty conclusion about the weakening of caste as the basis
of social organ ization. While it acknowledges the increased pace of so-

cial mobility and the weakening of some “traditional features of the
caste system,” it maintains that “what caste has lost on the ritual front,
it has more than gained on the po liti cal front.” [11] The report observes

that the related shifts in the power equation between high and lower
castes had exacerbated social tensions that could be contained if “the
ruling upper castes handle the legitimate aspirations and demands of

the historically suppressed and backward classes.” [12]

The second point relates to the defnition of merit. In a chapter ti-

tled “Social Justice, Merit, and Privilege,” the report states that “merit
in an elitist society is not something inherent but is the consequence
of environmental privileges enjoyed by the members of higher castes.”
The report also takes on Kalelkar’s opposition to caste classifcation
with a decisive statement on the relationship between caste and class.


-----

212 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Referring to two prior judgments, it argues that “caste is also a class of
citizens and if the class as a whole is socially and educationally back-

ward, reservation can be made in favor of such a caste.” [13] Fi nally, the

report echoes previous judgments in emphasizing that OBC candidates
recruited “on the basis of merit in open competition along with general candidates shall not be adjusted against the quota of 27 percent

14
reserved for them.” In other words, Mandal mandated that the “general category” not become a de facto quota for upper castes.

Signifcantly, the Mandal Commission targeted the very niche that

had been insulated from regional po liti cal demands: the central gov-

ernment jobs monopolized by groups with a long history of education,
whose children populated central government schools and colleges,

like the IITs. Unlike regional government jobs, which had been opened
up to new aspirants through quotas for SCs, STs, and OBCs, this upper
echelon had the 22.5 percent quota only for SCs and STs, which often

remained unflled. Moreover, as we have seen in the last two chapters,
because of their insulation from regional politics, central government
education and employment had become synonymous with upper- caste

meritocracy.

The Mandal Commission’s report was discussed twice in both

houses of Parliament in 1982 and 1983 with no decisive outcome. It was
only during the prime ministership of V. P. Singh (1989–1990) that
Mandal came into effect. Singh’s statement in Parliament in favor of

implementing the commission’s recommendations called into question
the very notion of merit in a highly unequal society. “We talk about
merit. What is the merit of the system itself?” he queried. “That the
section which is 52 percent of the population gets 12.55 percent in Gov-

ernment employment? . . . That in Class I employees of the Govern-

ment it gets only 4.69 percent? . . . I want to challenge frst the merit

of the system itself before we come to the question of merit.” [15]

The uproar caused by the implementation of the Mandal Commis-

sion’s recommendations on August 13, 1990, was responsible for the defeat of the V. P. Singh government in the 1991 general elections. Even
so, the successor government of P. V. Narasimha Rao largely accepted
Mandal while underscoring its class criteria and adding a 10 percent

quota for eco nom ically backward groups.


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 213

The petitioners in the Indra Sawhney case issued several challenges

to Mandal. First, they recycled older arguments from the 1951 Dorairajan case about reservation as a violation of equal rights. Second, they
maintained that Mandal mandated the unconstitutional use of caste
as the sole criterion for eligibility. Fi nally, they argued against the role

of the executive in expanding the scope of reservation. In making the
last argument against executive action, counsel K. K. Venugopal singled out Tamilnadu as a constitutional violator, remarking sardonically
that “before every general election a few communities are added to the

list of backward classes, only with a view to winning them over to the
ruling party.” [16] Tamilnadu was a clear case, he argued, of fundamental
rights falling prey to politics.

The Sawhney judgment is exhaustive in its consideration of rele-

vant cases both within and beyond India, most notably in the United
States. In the majority opinion, Justice Jeevan Reddy largely upheld the
government orders implementing the Mandal recommendations. First,

he underscored the admissibility of caste as a criterion in determining
backwardness with a reminder of Ambedkar’s original intent in using
the terms “class” and “backward.” Going by his words, Reddy argued,

“it cannot be concluded either that ‘class’ is antithetical to ‘caste’ or

that a caste cannot be a class or that a caste as such can never be taken
as a backward class of citizens. The word ‘class’ . . . in our opinion, is

used in the sense of social class— and not in the sense it is understood

in Marxist jargon.” Second, he ordered the exclusion of the “creamy
layer” from among the OBCs. This, he emphasized, was a matter of

“proper and more appropriate identifcation of a class as a backward
class. . . . If some of the members are far too advanced socially (which

in the context, necessarily means eco nom ically and may also mean

educationally), the connecting thread between them and the remaining
class snaps. They would be misfts in the class. After excluding them

alone would the class be a compact class. In fact, such exclusion benefts the truly backward.” Third, Reddy struck down the 10 percent res-

ervation for the poor as unconstitutional because there were no

grounds for discriminating against those with economic means.

Fourth, he limited the application of reservation to initial appoint-

ments and, invoking Ambedkar once more, recommended that the


-----

214 THE CASTE OF MERIT

total reservation of seats remain under 50 percent so as not “to nullify

the main Rule of equality.” As we will see later in the chapter, those

who opposed the OBC reservation system typically invoked these cri-

teria in advancing their criticisms.

Signifcantly, the strongest arguments in support of the Mandal

Commission came from states with power ful lower- caste movements:

Bihar, Kerala, and Tamilnadu. Tamilnadu’s po liti cal stance on reser-

vation came through in two key arguments against the 1992 judgment.
First, state counsel Siva Subramanium argued forcefully against the
“creamy layer” exclusion, contending that it was “a mere ruse, a trick,
to deprive the backward classes of the beneft of reservations.” Second,
he argued against the 50 percent ceiling as an arbitrary cap, especially

in states like Tamilnadu, where the enumerated Backward Caste population was over 80 percent. Contra counsel Venugopal’s indictment

of Tamilnadu, Subramanium heralded the state as a model, with its
long history of reservation dating back to 1921 and steady growth in
the quota to the current level of 69 percent.

Before we move to the third judgment in 2008, let us take a mo-

ment to appreciate the signifcance of the judiciary’s shift in perspective from 1951 to 1992. In 1951, the justices of the Supreme Court viewed
reservation as a po liti cal corruption of the princi ple of formal equality.

By 1992, their concern was no longer about upholding liberal princi ple

but about fnding the correct balance of merit and reservation as the
means to substantive equality. Moreover, this form of substantive
equality was now advanced in a language of technical mea sures. From

the upholders of a liberal legalist vision pitted against the demo cratic

calculations of the executive, the judges had themselves assumed the

17
role of technocrats working to engineer the perfect balance of outcomes. As we will see later in the chapter, upper- caste self- defnition

has similarly shifted from using only the language of formal equality
to increasingly relying on the terms of reservation policy. Even as upper
castes argued vociferously against reservation, they defned themselves
more and more as members of the meritorious “general category.” As
with the JEE’s categories of the “gifted” and the “coached,” reservation
provided them with a new language of hierarchical classifcation that
has become the basis not only for caste distinction but increasingly for
caste consolidation.

CONTESTING RESERVATION 215

_2008:_ Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India

The third consequential judgment on reservation was in response to
what came to be known as Mandal II. This involved the second part of
the Mandal Commission’s recommendations: a 27 percent reservation

for OBCs in centrally funded higher educational institutions, like the
IITs. In 2005, the Government of India passed the 93rd Amendment to
the Constitution, adding a ffth clause to Article 15 that allowed the
state to make “special provisions” for socially and educationally backward classes in all educational institutions, whether public or private,

state aided or non- state- aided. This was followed in 2006 with the Cen-

tral Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, which
brought all central government educational institutions under the um-

brella of the 27 percent OBC reservation. Together, the 93rd Amend-

ment and the 2006 act opened the door to the implementation of
Mandal II within the most elite echelon of public higher education.

Mandal I and Mandal II were implemented at very dif fer ent mo-

ments. Unlike in 1992, when central government jobs were still highly

coveted, Mandal II came well after the advent of economic liberaliza-

tion and the explosion in private sector employment. It sought to democ ra tize admission to the top echelon of public higher educational

institutions like the IITs, which were proven stepping- stones to private

sector opportunities.

The challenges to Mandal II came quickly. Altogether, there were

twelve cases fled on vari ous grounds. Most reprised older arguments

about the fundamental right to equality and the need to exclude the
“creamy layer.” To these were added some new ones: (1) that while res-

ervation for SCs / STs was justifed, the economic advancement of

OBCs and the severing of the “caste- occupation nexus” made them in-

eligible for reservation; (2) that the expansion of reservation policy to
include OBCs was excessive and had resulted in “reverse discrimination” against the nonreserved; (3) that the 27 percent OBC quota was

“not a genuine social engineering mea sure but vote bank politics”;

(4) that the extension of reservation to government- aided, private edu-

cational institutions was an unconstitutional effort to nationalize them;
and (5) that without a specifed time limit, reservation was by defnition
unconstitutional. In these challenges, we see the sense of threat posed


-----

216 THE CASTE OF MERIT

to upper castes by OBCs in par tic u lar. Unlike SC / STs, OBCs are per-

ceived as real competitors who, as in Tamilnadu, have the potential to
actually disrupt upper- caste entitlements. Indeed, we even see a rhe-

torical endorsement of the SC / ST quota as a counterpoint to the OBC

quota. [18]

But there were also those who felt that the government orders im-

plementing Mandal II had compromised on social justice by incorporating class criteria. These petitioners maintained that caste as an au-

tonomous and enduring system of stratifcation should be the sole
criterion. Once again, Tamilnadu represented this position most
clearly. The counsel for the Pattali Makkal Katchi, a Tamil po liti cal

party representing OBCs, argued that it was only the “creamy layer”
who could avail of such opportunities. “If the best from the lower caste
are deprived of these facilities and opportunities in the name of ‘creamy

layer,’ ” he stated, “it will be counter- productive and frustrate the very

object of reservation, namely to achieve equality in status, facilities and
opportunities.” [19]

Most of the challenges were shot down by the court. First, the jus-

tices maintained that a constitutional amendment “which moderately
abridges or alters the equality princi ple” cannot be said to violate the

basic structure of the Constitution. In striking contrast to the 1951
judgment, they argued for the crucial role of directive princi ples in a

democracy:

It is the Directive Princi ples which nourish the roots of our democ-

racy, provide strength and vigor to it and attempt to make it a real
participatory democracy which does not remain merely a po liti cal de-

mocracy with Fundamental Rights available to all irrespective of
their power, position or wealth. The dynamic provisions of the Directive Princi ples fertilize the static provisions of the Fundamental

Rights. The object of the Fundamental Rights is to protect individual
liberty, but can individual liberty be considered in isolation from the
socio- economic structure in which it is to operate? There is a real

connection between individual liberty and the shape and form of the
social and economic structure of the society. [20]

Second, they affirmed the constitutionality of quotas and pointed out
yet again that “the equality of citizens is the basic feature of the In-


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 217

dian Constitution but by ‘equality’ is meant not ‘formal or technical
equality’ but ‘real and substantial equality.’ ” Third, they referenced the

1992 judgment in reiterating that while caste was distinct from class, the correlation between the two made caste a legitimate basis for determining social and educational backwardness so _Indra Sawhney_
long as it was not the sole criterion. In this, they also went against the
Pattali Makkal Katchi’s objection to the “creamy layer” exclusion
while cautioning against applying “a strict income restriction” because

this might mean that “ those who are left in the par tic u lar caste may

not be able to have a sufficient number of candidates for getting admission in the central institutions.” To avoid this outcome, the justices authorized the central and state governments to “make a relaxation to some extent so that sufficient number of candidates may be
available for the purpose of flling up the 27 percent reservation.” [21]

_Merit and the Nonreserved_

The sequence of Supreme Court judgments from the 1950s through the
2000s illuminates changes in judicial opinion on reservation. From a
more categorical stand in favor of formal equality, the court moved

toward an embrace of compensatory mea sures to bridge the gap be-

tween formal and substantive equality. Nominally, the redress of
caste in equality was an ambition shared by the judiciary and by lower-

caste movements. However, they diverged when it came to the perception of upper castes. For the judiciary, the upper- caste subject remained

the ideal citizen, defned more by individual merit than by caste history. Even as the courts ratifed the redress of caste disability, they were

unable and unwilling to fully acknowledge and address caste privilege.
In all the wrangling over the precise par ameters and criteria of back-

wardness, the assumptions behind what constituted merit were left

largely unquestioned. Even as the quotas for OBCs, SCs, and STs expanded and reservation became an accepted mechanism of distributive
justice, assumptions about the innate meritoriousness of the nonreserved stayed mostly in place. It was only the reserved who came to be
marked by history and identity, while the nonreserved stood in simply
for casteless, ahistorical excellence.

This is evident even in those instances where judicial statements

directly addressed the question of merit. Take Justice Jeevan Reddy’s


-----

218 THE CASTE OF MERIT

statement in 1992 in response to the concern that “quota candidates”
would necessarily mean a decline in the efficiency of administration.
Reddy agreed that “the very idea of reservation implies se lection of a

less meritorious person” but went on to insist that “at the same time,
we recognize that this much cost has to be paid if the constitutional
promise of social justice is to be redeemed.” Reddy further argued for
a developmental approach to merit:

Given an opportunity, members of these classes are bound to over-

come their initial disadvantages and would compete with— and may,

in some cases, excel above— open competitor candidates. It is unde-

niable that nature has endowed merit upon members of backward
classes as much as it has endowed upon members of other classes and
that what is required is an opportunity to prove it. It may not, therefore, be said that reservations are anti- meritian. Merit there is even

among the reserved candidates and the small difference that may be
allowed at the stage of initial recruitment is bound to dis appear in

course of time. These members too will compete with and improve

their efficiency along with others. [22]

While Reddy insisted that the potential merit of the reserved only
needed appropriate opportunities for expression, he stopped short of in-

terrogating the social backgrounds of the nonreserved. Ultimately, his
developmental logic about merit as the unfolding of natu ral ability led

him to limit reservation to positions that were less prestigious. For

higher levels of the state’s educational, ser vice, and administrative in-

stitutions, he stated, “Merit . . . alone counts . . . and provision for res-

ervation would not be advisable.” [23]

These limits of judicial action maintained an upper- caste merito-

cratic norm. Even as the directive princi ples were made actionable and

arguments about formal equality challenged, the role of caste on the
other side of the equation remained curiously invisible. This was especially the case in the educational domain, with its correlation between the “general category” and “merit- based” admissions. The se-

mantic equivalence between the general and the meritorious reinforced
the idea that those who fall within the general category do so not on

the basis of accumulated caste privilege but by dint of their own merit.
This categorical distinction between the meritorious / casteless and the


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 219

reserved / caste- based has profoundly shaped the debate around educa-

tional equality in India. It has allowed those who fall within the gen-

eral category to invoke what Bourdieu calls an “imaginary universe of
perfect competition or perfect equality of opportunity, a world without
inertia, without accumulation, without heredity or acquired properties,” to argue that it is the system of reservation, and not the inheritances of caste, that undermines the modern republican ideal of equal
citizenship. [24]

Satish Deshpande has argued that the unmarking of upper castes

was built into the logic of constitutionalism from the outset. The new
Constitution, he maintains, “constrained the victims of caste to demand justice as a caste- marked exception, while its benefciaries were

25
empowered to demand the perpetuation of their advantages as a casteless norm.”
Deshpande dates this back to the 1951 verdict, which offered upper castes a form of agency “based on the universal- normative

position of ‘castelessness.’ . . . Constitutionally and legally, caste was

henceforth to be recognized only as a source of disadvantage or vulnerability, not as a source of privilege or advantage.” For upper castes,
Deshpande concludes, “caste- qua- caste has already yielded all that it

can and represents a ladder that can now be safely kicked away. Having
encashed its traditional caste- capital and converted it into modern

forms of capital like property, higher educational credentials and
strongholds in lucrative professions, this section believes itself to be
‘casteless’ today.” [26]

Looking back at the three consequential judgments on reservations,

Deshpande’s argument holds, but only partly. It is true that in the logic
of the legal judgments, the imagined future of castelessness was trans-

posed onto the “general category.” Even after the courts turned in favor

of reservation, caste continued to be explic itly marked on one side of

the equation. Judicial intervention reinforced the perception of upper
castes as casteless moderns whose merit was attributed to accumulated
talent, not privilege. However, there is another side to this pro cess,

which we see in the 1951 judgment: the marking of caste as culture, as
natu ral aptitude, and as the very basis of merit. Contrary to Desh-

pande’s argument, upper castes did not just come to think of themselves as casteless. Rather, there was a tension between marking and

unmarking at the heart of claims to merit.


-----

220 THE CASTE OF MERIT

We see this frst with Tamil Brahmins. The early marking of Tamil

Brahmins _as Brahmins_ by the Non- Brahmin and Dravidian movements

catalyzed the interplay of self- marking and unmarking through which

Tamil Brahmins made caste belonging consistent with merit. As we
saw in Chapter 5 in relation to the JEE, they began to mark caste affliation differently and in ways that aligned with demo cratic princi-

ples. In this chapter, we see even more clearly through Tamil Brahmin
claims to merit that castelessness is less a fait accompli and more an
aspect of upper- caste self- defnition that has shifted according to cir-

cumstance. The commensurability of caste and merit within these

claims shows that meritocracy is rarely just a universalistic politics of
achievement. It is also always about particularistic ascription.

With the expansion in lower- caste rights politics across India from

the 1990s, identitarian claims to merit have spread beyond Tamilnadu
and become much more overt. Just as proponents of reservation have
taken to the streets and the ballot box to make their demands known,
so too have upper castes engaged in collective action to express their
opposition to the expanding scope of reservation policy. And they have
done so in the name of rational law and merit, and against executive
authority that is susceptible to popu lar demands.

As we have seen, Tamilnadu’s approach to reservation betrays a

very dif fer ent stance on caste that illuminates the enduring power of

Non- Brahminism and Dravidianism, particularly its focus on status

conficts between upper and intermediate castes. First, the dominant
perspective of the regional executive and public is of caste as a foundational social structure and politics as an expression of caste interest
and confict. The purpose of policy and politics, then, is not to move
toward or shore up an ideal of casteless meritocracy; rather, it is to
render caste a stronger and more dynamic basis for competition over
resources and rights.

Second, reservation is understood more in continuity with the co-

lonial era’s approach to proportional repre sen ta tion than as provisional

and temporary redress for historical disabilities. We see this in the
Tamilnadu state counsel’s stance on the Indra Sawhney case. By invoking a continuity with colonial policy, he explic itly folded postcolo-

nial reservation policy into an earlier model of repre sen ta tion where


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 221

ascriptive collectives are the basic units of po liti cal society. The model

of proportional repre sen ta tion is evident in Tamilnadu’s approach to

the OBC quota, which was revised upward from 25 percent in 1951 to

31 percent in 1972 and 50 percent in 1980.

Fi nally, the steady expansion of quotas as part of Dravidian pop u-

lism indicates the centrality of the po liti cal arena for the contestation

of rights and resources. There has been strong po liti cal mobilization

for advancing greater parity in caste repre sen ta tion in state employ-

ment and education, especially between OBCs and upper castes.
Whenever the courts have pushed back, popu lar pressure has won the

day. We see this in 1980, when the Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam
(ADMK) government instituted an annual income limit for reservation. The government order elicited widespread protests by the
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and other opposition parties,
leading the ADMK to withdraw the income ceiling and increase the
OBC quota to 50 percent, bringing the percentage of reserved seats to

68 percent. Both the government orders revoking the income ceiling

and increasing the OBC quota were challenged in the Supreme Court.

Upon direction from the Supreme Court, the Tamilnadu government
constituted the Ambashankar Backward Classes Commission in 1982
to review the existing enumeration and classifcation of “socially and
educationally backward” groups. On the basis of its fnding that
87 percent of the state’s population were eligible for reservation, the

government further expanded the list of Backward Classes to include
lower- caste converts to Chris tian ity and Islam, bringing the total to

69 percent.

The remainder of this chapter considers the social life of the law.

As we will see, the binaries of caste and class, law and politics, reason

and pop u lism, and liberal constitutionalism and illiberal vote bank ap-

peasement have been consistent themes within anti- reservation dis-

course both within and beyond the IITs. Another common refrain, one
that is particularly resonant in Tamil Brahmin narratives, identifes
Tamilnadu as a constitutional violator because of its privileging of

caste over class and its expansion of reservation beyond 50 percent. In

all these arguments, we see efforts to rein in redistributive pro cesses

through recourse to a meritocratic status quo.


-----

222 THE CASTE OF MERIT

The Politics of Reservation

IIT Madras has become a key site for strengthening Tamil Brahmin and
upper- caste affiliation in the context of an expanding reservation

system. The place of Tamilnadu as an early adopter of reservation and
the pre ce dent set by Tamil Brahmins as the frst “victims” of “anti-

meritocratic pop u lism” are both particularly salient to this pro cess.

While Tamil Brahmins were arguably one of the frst upper- caste groups

to articulate a more explicit, ascriptive claim to merit against reservation, such arguments have now become widespread. As we will see

later in the chapter, these claims index new forms of po liti cal subjec-

tivity that expand the par ameters of caste affiliation. In a striking in-

stance of the social life of governmental classifcation, “the general category” and “the reserved category” have become highly salient forms
of collective affiliation with the latter standing in for the backward and
the former for the non- backward.

_Making Tamil Brahmin Merit_

In Chapter 4, we saw the vari ous ways that 1960s IITians approached

the question of caste. While some acknowledged class differences on
campus, most disavowed caste as a form of belonging or stratifcation
within the institution. The one exception was Tamil Brahmins, who
were more willing to acknowledge the salience of caste as group culture and as scapegoated identity. As the discursive target of Non-
Brahminism, Tamil Brahmins came to be hypervisible and their
claims to knowledge inextricably linked to caste privilege. This is expressed, for instance, in the sardonic name for IIT Madras in the Tamil
vernacular press: Iyer Iyengar Technology. [27] At the same time, the caste
marking of IIT Madras and of Tamil Brahmins did not preclude claims
to merit. On the contrary, Tamil Brahmins understood the institution
as meritocratic _because_ of its association with them and its insulation

from the pressures of regional lower- caste demands. Their marking as

caste subjects has produced a heightened consciousness of their own
collective affiliation. Sometimes, as we saw earlier, this sense of col-

lectivity was expressed through their self- representation as an educa-

tionally oriented middle class with a unique knack for conceptual

knowledge. Satish Deshpande’s observation that the terminology of res-


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 223

ervation policy evacuates caste markers from the general category is
partially evident in this recourse to middle- class identity. However, in

the context of Tamilnadu, a claim to castelessness on the part of Brahmins is implausible. Rather, caste ascription is part and parcel of their
claim to merit. As we will see, this is even more the case when it comes

to the issue of reservation, where caste becomes a far more explicit
point of reference for merit.

For Tamil Brahmins who entered IIT Madras before the 1990s ex-

pansion of private engineering education, the founding of the institute
was uniquely propitious. Affiliation to an “institution of national importance,” where the only means to admission was the JEE, promised
some mea sure of redress for what they perceived as their victimiza-

tion by regional politics. Although it is only a small minority of Tamil
Brahmins who actually attended IIT Madras, in the context of the Dravidianist transformation of regional society and politics, the institute
acquired a symbolic signifcance well beyond its material ramifcations. The association between caste and merit has underwritten the
social formation of Tamil Brahmins more generally, in terms of both
cross- class identifcation and disidentifcation with non- Brahmin

Tamils. This is expressed most clearly through opposition to regional
reservation policy, which they feel has denied them the only remaining
form of social capital they have: education. The confuence of these

factors has given IIT Madras outsized signifcance in the Tamil
Brahmin cultural milieu.

Tamil Brahmin alumni from across the de cades registered a sense

of how their horizons had been narrowed in the region. Nagan, a 1970s
alumnus, spoke of IIT Madras as a key destination for Tamil Brahmin
boys. “A lot of Brahmins would go there,” he said, “ because if you were

from Madras, and if you are a Brahmin, unless you’re in the top one,

two percent, you can’t get into a professional college. Brahmins never

got anywhere. So this was seen as a place that Brahmins could walk
into if they made it through [the exam].” [28]

Similarly, Shankar, a 1980s alumnus, narrated his own path into

IIT as part of a family and community pattern. “I graduated in 1983

and my sister had already done a PhD in IIT Madras in chemistry. One

of my cousins was among the frst batch of IIT Madras gradu ates, so it

was very much the thing to do for upper middle class— not upper


-----

224 THE CASTE OF MERIT

middle class— middle class Brahmin families, you know? This is what

you do. You get into a profession, mostly engineering, mostly through
IIT.” [29]

Madhavan, the “star teacher” from Chapter 5 and a 1990s alumnus,

also echoed this sentiment by framing the choice of the IITs as a non-
choice. “ Whether or not it’s valid,” he remarked, “ there is defnitely a

very strong sense that the IIT is the only option for Tamil Brahmin
boys which makes them try that much harder to get in. For Backward
Caste boys, they know that not getting those extra marks will still

mean that they can get into Anna [University] or some other engineering college.” Madhavan spoke of how the aspiration to attend the
IITs shaped schooling from much earlier. “It’s instilled in Tamil

Brahmin boys that IIT is the only institution they can reasonably aspire to because of reservations. Because of this, parents send kids to

Central Board schools where the curriculum is more in line with the
orientation of the JEE.” [30]

Venkat, a 1980s alumnus, spoke in the strongest terms about Tamil

Brahmins’ sense of collective exclusion. He began by echoing many of
the other comments we’ve heard about education as the princi ple form

of middle- class capital:

Education has always been highly cherished by the middle class in

each society. It’s a big deal. All Indian mothers want their kids to be-

come doctors or engineers. Professional careers are seen as a status.

So for kids like that it was the IITs that provided one outlet where it
didn’t matter who you knew, it didn’t matter if you had money, you

could get in on merit. And along with that came a lot of prestige
because getting into IIT meant you had to pass this ridicu lous en-

trance exam that was super competitive. So that basically created a
concentration of alpha kids who wanted to make out and break out
because they put the effort in, to crack the exam to get in, which is
why you have the concentration of middle class kids. [31]

In Venkat’s class imagination of Tamilnadu, there were the rich

who “can always fnd their way out, say by going abroad or paying their

way to college, or through infuence,” and the poor who “basically are
in a situation where they need their kids to start working earlier to sup-

port the family fnances.” In the middle were people like him, “alpha


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 225

kids” whose families prized education and whose intellectual ambition drew them to the hypercompetitive JEE.

When I pushed him on who “kids like that” are, he expanded on his

class analy sis to say that they were mostly “CBSE [Central Board of Sec-

ondary Education] kids,” many of whose parents were themselves in the

central government ser vices. He himself had attended the Vidya Mandir

school in Chennai, which he described as “a Brahmin school. It was
started by the Mylapore Brahmin Association, Ladies Association. . . .
So the kids that came to this school came from typically lower income
Brahmin families. There was a huge emphasis on mathe matics, and lot

of pressure to do well at mathe matics at the cost of every thing else even

if you were talented in something dif fer ent. That caused lot of kids, nat-

urally or unnaturally, to get into IIT because the IIT entrance exam is

purely based on mathe matics, physics, and chemistry.”

Apart from class and caste, Venkat also used the language of ge ne-

tics to signify Tamil Brahmin merit. He moved between describing
Tamil Brahmins as “a concentrated gene pool” and as “ middle class”

achievers. This back and forth between ge ne tics and class is perhaps

the starkest illustration of the interplay of ascription and achievement
through which Tamil Brahminness is constituted as a form of cultural
and intellectual inheritance.

Venkat’s sense of being Tamil Brahmin was not just about cultur-

ally inscribed achievement; it was also about constraint. He characterized Tamil Brahminness as excellence in situations of “ limited op-

portunity.” We might think of this as the caste version of forging
character through hardship— a prevalent trope in modern narratives of

personal achievement. “Within Tamil Nadu,” Venkat elaborated, “the
Brahmin community has been the one most affected by reservation
policies and the IIT was the one place you could get in purely on merit.”
He then expanded his argument to include other populations whose
experiences he found resonant. “I think any community around the
world where you have put them in a box, they will fght back in some

form. The Jewish community has been successful for the same reason.
If you look at the Parsis— not that IIT is a community in that form,

but the concept is similar— the Parsis in my mind are the single most

successful community. There are only 55,000 of them globally, 40,000

of them live in Bombay and from there they control, not just business


-----

226 THE CASTE OF MERIT

but arts and sciences and politics, the armed forces.” Success for Jews
and Parsis, Venkat argued, was a by- product of having “their backs

against the wall. They had to make it, which caused them to fght in a
certain form, through an emphasis on education, with tremendous
pressure from the family to overcome the odds and make it and work

together as a community.” It was “the same concept” at the IITs,
“ people who have not necessarily had normal opportunity doing what

they had to do to make it.” In equating reservation for lower castes with
the historical constraints faced by Jews and Parsis, Venkat constituted
Tamil Brahmins as an embattled minority within a region dominated
by hostile lower castes. Their characterization as a middle class fghting

with only one weapon in their arsenal— education— disregards the long

and multifaceted history of Tamil Brahmin capital encompassing ritual
authority, landownership, and state employment. Venkat substituted
this longer history of vari ous forms of capital accumulation with a

more recent history of state intervention as a result of which, as he
framed it, Tamil Brahmins’ only recourse was to education. As we will

see in Chapter 7, this idea of upper- caste IITians as a population stripped

of other resources falling back on their intellect has acquired an added
charge with diasporic mobility.

Tamil Brahmin affiliation with IIT Madras as a meritocratic refuge

within the “caste- ridden” landscape of regional education was shaken

with the extension of quotas to the IITs. This happened frst in 1973
with the implementation of a 22.5 percent reservation for SCs / STs, and

then again in 2006 with the 27 percent reservation for OBCs. I asked

Venkat what he thought of the extension of reservation to the IITs. “I
think it dilutes the gene pool,” he told me. “The one thing about IIT

was that it was purely on merit. It’s not that just because you went

through IIT you became such a kind of a person. Yes, it gives you [a]
certain level of exposure but frst was getting through the exam— that’s

impor tant. So, if somebody who would have been 74,000 in that exam

gets in because of some reservation policy, the defnition would be you

are diluting the gene pool. So I’m totally against it.” Signifcantly, for
Venkat, ge ne tic predisposition was far more emblematic of who an

IITian was than the training that person received at the institutes.
While the training might offer “exposure,” it was “ge ne tics” that was

the more defnitive infuence.


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 227

Many Tamil Brahmin alumni echoed Venkat’s argument about res-

ervation as an illegitimate tool used to deny the rights of the meritorious. But even those who acknowledged that reservation was a re-

sponse to the historical advantages enjoyed by upper castes ultimately
fell back on characterizing merit not as a by- product of those advan-

tages but as an accumulated virtue that was attributable to a cultural
propensity for knowledge. For instance, Swaminathan, a 1978 alumnus,
dismissed the tendency to attribute Tamil Brahmin success in the JEE
to innate talent. “It’s historical,” he offered by way of a corrective. [32]
He then went on to elaborate on what he meant by history. “I mean,
prob ably Brahmins have invested 2000, 3000 years in education as a

fundamental thing, so you can deduce. . . . There are some controver-

sial studies which have been suppressed, which have been about Brahmins and the rest, which are not being widely publicized. . . . You can’t

quote these in today’s po liti cally correct world, leave alone in your uni-

versity. You’re not allowed to say that there are actually differences in

intelligence.” When I pushed Swaminathan on how he understood the
prevalence of Brahmins in institutions like the IITs, he paused and then
said, “I think there are historical advantages. . . . Whether that trans-

lates into analytical intelligence as examined by tests, God knows, but
I believe it is true because the results are like that. You have to have a

good explanation for the exam results.” Unlike Venkat’s naturalization
of merit as ge ne tic, Swaminathan offered an explanation that made re-

course to history but was cleansed of power and contingency. Rather,
it was an origin story about the Brahmin propensity for education that
has played out faithfully for “2000, 3000 years.” Within it, there are

Brahmins who have treated education as “fundamental,” with the result of “ actual differences in intelligence” evident in the JEE results.

This is history as a stage for a predetermined drama where intellectual differences are rendered inevitable. It is history as cultural logic.

Swaminathan even acknowledged that Brahmins had been dispro-

portionately represented in higher education and the professions but
attributed this less to structural advantages than to a collective propensity to educational advancement. This propensity, he argued, led
Brahmins to fnd opportunities in emerging educational felds. At frst,
it was in the literary humanities, then law, and f nally the technical

sciences. As with shifting professional tracks, one could also see this


-----

228 THE CASTE OF MERIT

propensity to nose out the best opportunities in shifting institutional
locations. Before the 1960s, Swaminathan elaborated, Brahmins had
been the single biggest group in regional colleges. With reservation,
lower- caste enrollment in government colleges expanded. Initially, this

took Brahmins to the IITs. But by the 1990s, those who couldn’t get

into the IITs could also opt for private colleges. The embrace of private
education, he emphasized, was a sea change in the Tamil Brahmin
worldview. “ Today it is not a stigma in a Brahmin family to go and

study in Sri Venkateswara. It was in the late 1980s. You understand? It
became an accepted thing.” [33]

In one sense, Swaminathan’s narrative of shifting Tamil Brahmin

intellectual and institutional orientations was a history of change. But
it was also the story of a caste mind- set. Swaminathan attributed to

Tamil Brahmins a cultural trait of educational and professional achievement that allowed them to stay one step ahead of the curve. Ultimately, his “historical” account, too, came down on achievement as
an expression of caste ascription. It is a story of Brahmins as uncannily resourceful and having a preternatural capacity for instrumental
action. It speaks to faith in a form of collective agency in which, regardless of circumstances, they are able to make their own history.

These Tamil Brahmin narratives showcase the impact of reserva-

tion policy on caste identity. While most social analyses of reservation
focus on its centrality to lower- caste identity and rights politics, here

we see how profoundly reservation has molded upper- caste identity,

rights claims, even notions of history. For Tamil Brahmins, the politics of Dravidianism and the policy of reservation shook a structure of
settled expectations and catalyzed claims to both social and po liti cal

victimhood as well as intellectual merit. In such claims we see the dialectic of ascription and achievement that makes it pos si ble for Tamil

Brahmins to characterize themselves both as a caste historically— even

genet ically— and as middle- class individuals whose membership in IIT

Madras is testament to their merit. As an “institution of national importance” in the heart of “non- Brahmin” Tamilnadu, IIT Madras has

helped to suture caste belonging and intellectual merit. Indeed, the institution’s own claim to exceptionalism has been pivotal to the very
production of Tamil Brahminness as the embodiment of middle- class

meritocracy. This identitarian politics belies the commonsense as-


-----

sumption that upper castes have evacuated ascriptive markers and
transcended a politics of caste in favor of more universalistic self-

representation. What we see instead is the tacking back and forth between the par tic u lar and universal through culturally embedded ex-

pressions of meritocracy. Let us now look more closely at the impact of
each set of reservation quotas on caste opposition and consolidation.

_The 1973 Quota_

Reservation was frst extended to the IITs in 1973 through a 22.5 percent

quota for SCs and STs. This central government quota was dwarfed by
the existing regional quotas for SCs, STs, and OBCs, which stood at
49 percent. Still, the extension of reservation to the institute was seen

as a capitulation to the politics of caste and a violation of meritocracy.
For IITians, the 1973 reservation quotas blurred the distinction between
IIT Madras and the wider world of regional engineering education,
where caste and po liti cal connections were seen as the preferred

currency.

One of the most vocal opponents was P. V. Indiresan, director of IIT

Madras from 1979 to 1984. In his Director’s Report of 1983, he indicted
the 1973 reservation policy in a strong echo of the 1951 High Court verdict in favor of Brahmin petitioners Dorairajan and Srinivasan:

Some members of the [Parliamentary Committee on Scheduled
Castes] have gone so far as to say that what we need is an Indian standard and not an international standard of instruction. Whether we

need or need not be aware of the latest developments in technology,
it is necessary to debate the fundamental question whether, just

because a group of people cannot cope with a certain level of educa-

tion, they should have the veto power to deny such an education to
the rest; whether social justice should imply that there shall be no

institution at all in the country where merit shall be the criterion

and also while the socially- deprived should have special privileges,

the talented need have no rights of their own. [34]

The distinction drawn by Indiresan between “the socially- deprived”

and “the talented” speaks volumes. By referring to the nonreserved
simply as “the talented,” his statement rendered the social bases of merit
irrelevant. Furthermore, the distinction between “special privileges”


-----

230 THE CASTE OF MERIT

and “rights” speaks to the recurrent theme of reservations as antithetical to demo cratic equality and meritocracy as consistent with it.

Fi nally, by pointedly contrasting an “Indian” with an “international”

standard, Indiresan assimilated the IITs into a global meritocratic
norm that is inherently superior to the mediocrity of a nation willing
to sacrifce excellence to social justice. In 2011, it was Indiresan who
took the Indian government to court challenging the constitutional
validity of the 2006 reservation policy. His pivotal role in the legal

battle further underscores the signifcance of Tamilnadu as a pre ce dent

in a nationally proliferating politics of meritocracy.

Dynamics internal to the IITs make clear that Indiresan’s distinc-

tion between “the talented” and “the socially- deprived” had wide res-

onance. SC and ST students started attending the IITs from the early
1980s, and from all accounts, their integration into the campuses was
far from smooth. [35] Those who gained admission through reservation

were routinely assumed to be intellectual and social inferiors who had
stolen highly coveted seats from more deserving applicants. The culture of the IITs rendered them intruders in a realm that was not rightfully theirs. That those who gained admission to the IITs through the

1973 quota suffered routine slights and indignities and were thoroughly

alienated within their institutional settings was graphically revealed
through a spate of suicides and attempted suicides across the vari ous

campuses. [36]

_Conscription into Brahminness_

Although the 1973 quota brought SC and ST students into IIT Madras,
their small numbers and extreme marginality did not signifcantly
shake up the cultural ethos of the institution. Their presence only contributed to the comfortable sense of a meritocratic norm that did not
have to be defended. While upper- caste IITians did object to reserva-

tion in princi ple, their response to the presence of these students was

more paternalistic and pejorative than defensive.

When it came to Backward Caste students, there was a very dif-

fer ent dynamic at play. Unlike SC and ST students, around whom a

speculative economy of evaluation, stigmatization, and masking fourished (more on this later), the Backward Caste students who gained

admission through the “general category” were rendered illegible. The


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 231

absence of a quota for them led to the unexamined assumption that
they were upper caste. While this was the case more generally, it was

especially so when it came to Tamils. The fraught regional tensions
between Brahmin and non- Brahmin Tamils, and the need for Brahmin

Tamils to claim caste exceptionalism via the IIT pedigree, translated
into a pro cess of conscription into Brahminness. Backward Caste

Tamils were made into Brahmins simply by virtue of having gained

admission through the general category.

The conscription of Tamil IITians into Brahminness was strikingly

conveyed to me by Senthil, an alumnus from the 1990s. He was
changing his clothes when his Tamil Brahmin roommate inquired into
the whereabouts of his the sacred thread worn by male Brahmins. “When I told him that I _poonal,_ don’t wear one, he paused and then asked,

‘ Doesn’t your mother get upset?’ It never struck him that I was Back-

ward Caste. In fact, I think he still assumes that I’m from a particularly liberal Brahmin family.” [37] Siva, another Backward Caste alumnus

from the 1980s, spoke of the discomfort of being party to antireservation debates among his peers. “As long as none of the SC / ST students

were in the room, they felt free to say what ever they wanted about res-

ervations, how they’re unfair, that they bring down standards. A lot of

them would also speak about the reservations in Tamilnadu as unconstitutional and say that this shows how corrupt the regional government is. It was a strange experience because my whole family are DMK

supporters. But I didn’t say anything so they had no idea that I’m not

Forward Caste.” [38]

We might think of these instances of caste misrecognition and con-

scription into Brahminness as “passing” in reverse: unlike the stories
of passing in the United States, where blacks attempted to “pass” as
white in order to avail themselves of the benefts of whiteness, here it

is the upper- caste student who needs to assimilate his lower- caste

This desire to erase difference is particularly telling in the context of Tamilnadu, where a long history of reservation has meant that peer. [39]
increasing numbers of lower castes do in fact inhabit the same social
spaces as upper castes. The blurring of bound aries through the dis-

persal of social capital has produced acute status anxiety among regional upper castes and the need to create new distinctions that once
again differentiate high from low. IIT Madras has uniquely ser viced


-----

232 THE CASTE OF MERIT

this need: in response to the blurring of caste status bound aries in the

wider region, within the walls of the institution it has become imperative to mark the Tamil IITian as Brahmin.

While Backward Caste Tamils were largely invisible to their Brahmin

peers, the reverse was hardly the case. All the Backward Caste students
I spoke with were acutely aware of the caste under pinnings of campus

dynamics. They talked to me about how caste difference was channeled
through the most mundane aspects of everyday life: clothes, vehicles,
and language.

Senthil spoke to me about clothing. “The attitude was, I’m not going

to dress up well,” he explained. “ Because you were an IITian, you could

be eccentric. The whole thinking was about fundas, goals, concepts,

and I really don’t need to please you by ftting into what you think are

social customs. So, if you invite me for a wedding, I’ll make it a point
to come in a torn T- shirt.” [40] Senthil spoke of the upper- caste IITian

scorn for social custom as something that he observed and even admired from a distance but never fully inhabited. “I was kind of an
outsider,” he told me, “ because my house was fve minutes from the

campus. They would always see me as the kind of guy who would wear
shoes outside. I was completely a part of the system but you wouldn’t

fnd me wearing torn slippers and patched jeans.” Senthil then pointed
to the crisp shirt, pants, and shoes he was wearing and said, “I’m more
of a suit than the other guys but I didn’t wear this outft within IIT. In

my four years I never once, you would never catch me in Dockers or
something like that.” I asked him if he meant he would consciously
dress down. “Yeah,” he responded. “The reason for that is I was moving
in and out, and these guys used to make fun of me. So I would change

my clothing on campus. If I dressed up there, I would be as much of a

social outcast as I would be if I dressed down here.”

In Senthil’s sartorial code- switching, we see the negotiation be-

tween two worlds of caste. In the extra- campus world, Backward

Caste pride was expressed through formal attire and social respectability. In the campus world, these very forms of status were denigrated

as signs of crass materialism and intellectual inferiority. Instead, the
campus norm was the per for mance of a kind of Brahminical austerity,

where concern for anything but the cultivation of the mind was considered superfcial and suspect. IITians were to embody “pure intel-


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 233

lect” and eschew the trappings of the material world. As a result,
Senthil, the Backward Caste student, felt social pressure to “dress
down” or be ostracized as “a suit.” Through these micro- evaluations

of dress code, Backward Caste students worked to erase bodily signs of
material aspiration for fear of appearing intellectually inadequate.

The active disdain for social custom and its associated forms of ma-

terialism extended to vehicles. Siva talked to me about the politics of
transport. “Every body in IIT had a cycle, but if you owned your own

car, you’d be torn apart. I knew of classmates who would come by car
to the gate and then walk. Nobody would know this guy came by car,
and if they found out then the whole eve ning they will be like, this

guy is so materialistic, he came by car.” Like Senthil, Siva felt the need
to perform austerity in order to be treated like a true IITian. Any sign
of material wealth became outward evidence of intellectual paucity.
For Backward Caste students like himself, he pointed out, this was
more tricky than for wealthy upper castes. “Some of the wealthy upper
caste kids from Chennai would come in cars and not care. But we already felt like we didn’t really ft in, and if you then show up with a

two- wheeler [motorcycle] or a car, it was even worse.”

Fi nally, there was language. Here, too, there was a form of Brah-

minical common sense that made the campus feel culturally alien to
Backward Caste Tamils. This is best illustrated through the words of
Kartik, a Tamil Brahmin alumnus from 1995. He was from Mylapore, a
predominantly Brahmin neighborhood in Chennai, and had grown up
in a largely Brahmin world. As did his neighbors, Kartik spoke “Brahmin
Tamil,” a dialect that uses more Sanskrit derivatives. [41] He told me that
he felt truly at home at IIT Madras. He talked about the comforting
sense of homecoming he felt upon entering the campus gates, where the
Brahmin dialect spoken by his family was ubiquitous. [42]

Part of this dialect was the resort to the familiar, something that

was at odds with the more formal Tamil of many non- Brahmins. Nagan,

another Tamil Brahmin alumnus, explained that at IIT Madras, “the
way you converse, the way you address each other, it’s all very Brahminical. The language, the culture of the school was very informal, as
it was in my high school days, the way you deal with each other in high
school, in a very back- slapping way.” I asked Nagan if he thought that

came out of a sense of commonality. “Yes,” he agreed, “but it’s also


-----

234 THE CASTE OF MERIT

maybe a sense that we’re dif fer ent from the others. IITians had that

feeling, we’re dif fer ent from the others. Most of them didn’t say it, but

it’s there if you dig deep into their psyche.”

For Backward Caste Tamils, however, this informality felt less like

commonality and more like an insult. Pandiarajan, a 1970s alumnus,
remembered that this tension was especially palpable in his day. He
grew up in the southern Madurai district of Tamilnadu, where his
father was in regional government ser vice. Although he was Backward

Caste, he studied at Madura College, which he characterized as an overwhelmingly Brahmin institution “from attendant to principal” that
was jokingly referred to by non- Brahmins as “sambar college,” in ref-

erence to Brahmin vegetarianism. [43] It was because of his exposure to

Brahmins, Pandiarajan told me, that he even thought to apply to IIT.
Unlike non- Brahmins, he explained, “the information networking

among Brahmins is far more efficient. Even at that time, there were

national networks.” As an example of the spatial reach of Brahmins,
Pandiarajan pointed to cricket. “The caste community that really took

up cricket frst was the Brahmin community.” He elaborated, “At that
time, cricket was a sign of urbanization. And Brahmins were very ur-

banized. If you read the jokes in _Kalki_ and _Ananda Vikatan,_ they had
many about cricket that were only comprehensible to the Brahmin

community. When there were cricket matches going on, the Brahmin

boys would always hang on to the transistor radio. They had relatives
in Chennai and would take a train to go watch matches. So the network was far more efficient among the Brahmins, and information
fowed far more efficiently.” [44] The existing social and spatial differences,
Pandiarajan continued, were heightened by the spread of Dravidianism.

“Nineteen sixty- seven was the year that DMK came to power,” he re-

called. “In 1968, Anna died, and it was Karunanidhi’s period. Already,
the Brahmins were complaining about reservations. As someone who

straddled both worlds, I was acutely aware of the social disparities between caste communities because I had been to the home of every body

in my school class and was treated differently by dif fer ent groups.”

Pandiarajan attended IIT Madras during the de cade following the

Dravidianist transformation of po liti cal life in the region. He experi-

enced it as an upside- down world. In contrast to the growing power

of Dravidianism across the state, Backward Caste Tamils were a tiny,


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 235

illegible minority on campus. Most of the time, caste tensions were

kept under wraps or addressed with humor. For instance, Pandiarajan and

his Backward Caste friends would in private refer to Brahmin classmates from Chennai as “Mylos” or the “5Bs,” referring to the Brahmin-
dominated neighborhood of Mylapore and the 5B bus that terminated
there. At other times, the tensions would come to the surface. Pandiarajan told me about one “cultural clash” in his frst year between his
friend Amudhan and a Brahmin classmate. “We had come from workshop, a bunch of people were washing their hands in the wash basin. A

lot of people were standing next to each other and this guy, Kuppu-

swami, he wanted Amudhan to move a little bit. So he used the ‘da’

form. _En da, konja thalli nillenda._ [Dude, stand a little to the side]. And

Amudhan got very wild because he is from Tirunelveli where the Tamil

is very respectful.”

These negotiations between Brahmins and non- Brahmins played

out a dif fer ent kind of caste drama from the tensions that emerged

around the 1973 quota. Here, too, there was a working assumption of

an upper- caste status quo and the need to locate oneself in relation to

it. However, the same forms of stigma were not in operation because

these Backward Castes had gained admission through the “general category.” They had proven their intellectual worth by attaining JEE
ranks that qualifed them for “merit- based admissions” and were thus

illegible as Backward Caste. Through the 1990s, campus dynamics
were marked by an imbalance between the blithe ignorance of Backward Caste presence on the part of Brahmins and an acute awareness
of caste differences on the part of lower castes.

Until the 1990s, the relatively small 1973 quota and the extreme

marginalization of SC and ST students maintained the representative
power of upper castes. As we saw from Indiresan’s quote from 1983, the
IITian defense of merit was still very much about an appeal to universalistic norms that came from a comfortable position of dominance.
But changes beginning in the 1990s led to a more explicit and defensive politics of caste.

The 1990 and 2006 OBC quotas shifted the terms of engagement.

Within IIT Madras, the opposition to reservation and claims to merit
were still constitutive of Tamil Brahmin identity. However, the expansion of quotas to OBCs, frst in central government jobs in the 1990s


-----

236 THE CASTE OF MERIT

and then in central government educational institutions in the 2000s,
produced a new structure of feeling. Merit came to be mapped onto an
emergent form of upper- caste identity where what mattered was not

caste affiliation based in understandings of endogamy and history but
the governmental distinction between the “general” and the “reserved.” The claim to merit as members of the “general category”
was by no means a pro cess contained within the IITs. Rather, the in-

stitutes were part of a much wider national shift toward upper- caste

consolidation in reaction to the recommendations of the Mandal
Commission.

_The 1990 and 2006 Quotas_

When Prime Minister V. P. Singh announced on August 7, 1990, that
his government had accepted the Mandal Commission report and
would move forward with implementing a 27 percent reservation policy

for OBCs in public sector jobs, it ignited a frestorm in the northern
Hindi- speaking belt. Upper- caste students took to the streets, staging

sit- ins; setting up road blockades; and masquerading as vendors,

sweepers, and shoe shiners in a graphic depiction of their future reduc-

tion to lower- caste labor. The starkest expression of opposition was

self- immolation, with one Delhi University student, Rajeev Goswami,

being the frst to unsuccessfully attempt this tactic. Goswami’s act
sparked a series of self- immolations by other college students. In the

weeks following his attempt, more than 150 students followed his example, with the death toll reaching 63. Those who immolated them-

selves were treated as martyrs who had sacrifced their lives for the

country. In Delhi, agitating students even named one of the key traffic
intersections that they commandeered Qurbani Chowk, or Sacrifce
Square. [45]

Often, student ire was made explicit in suicide notes. Surinder

Singh Chauhan, the frst college student to die from self- immolation,

left a note stating, “The responsibility for my death lies with those who

consider reservation a vote bank, people like V. P., Paswan, Yadav, and

so on.” Sushil Kumar, another college student from Haryana, consumed poison, leaving [46] behind a note that said, “Only V. P. Singh is

responsible for my death.” In Pathankot, an eleventh- grade student,

Narinder Kaur, hanged herself from a ceiling fan. Her suicide note


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 237

requested that her eyes be donated to the prime minister “so that he
can see better for himself the misery the report had brought upon
the student community. There is no other reason but the Mandal

Commission report which made me take such a step.” [47]

Psychologists held forth in the news media, opining that it was

usually the brightest students who resorted to such extreme mea sures.

“Aspirations lead to greater frustration,” explained the head of the psychol ogy department at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

“This in turn spurs you into action.” Another added that suicide results
“when you feel that the value of knowledge will take you nowhere. The

pressure of being brilliant and not making it leads to intense psychic
turmoil.” [48]

That the spectacular courting of death was a po liti cal choice ratio-

nalized by media and clinical experts alike speaks volumes about the
settled expectations of caste. Rather than a redistributive mechanism,
reservation was widely regarded as po liti cal pandering to lower castes

and a grave injustice to the meritorious. Characterizing reservation as
“vote bank politics” not only gestured to an unseemly alliance between
po liti cal elites and lower castes but also reinforced the sense that the

benefciaries of reservation were members of opportunistic caste groups

devoid of educational qualifcations. By contrast, the rhe toric about the

frustrated aspirations and curbed brilliance of aggrieved students sidestepped their caste identities altogether in favor of foregrounding their

intellectual abilities. On one side were politicized castes; on the other,

meritorious students. One group was defned in purely ascriptive terms,
the other in terms of frustrated achievement. It is only when we consider the opposition between “the meritorious” and “the reserved” that
the presumed caste basis of merit comes into view.

Indeed, one of the accusations leveled against Mandal was that it

was responsible for the spread of casteism, even of caste consciousness.
As one po liti cal science research scholar lamented to a journalist, “We

used to have Hindu College vs. St. Stephens or Miranda House vs. Lady
Sriram College rivalries. Now they are forcing us to think on caste
lines.” [49] Rajeev Goswami’s daughter, Simran, who moved to Michigan

after her father’s death in 2003, offered a perspective that sharply con-

trasted Indian and American social landscapes. “My father fought

against the politics of reservation and for the recognition of merit,” she


-----

238 THE CASTE OF MERIT

stated proudly in a newspaper interview. Explaining her move to the
United States, she added that she wanted “to get away from India’s divisive politics” and was glad that her “new home has no reservation. . . .
In the US, only merit is recognized.” [50]

The idea that students who previously thought of themselves purely

as individuals or as part of modern institutional formations were now

compelled to enter into caste consciousness rendered Mandal not only
unjust but regressively illiberal. Moreover, by granting quotas to lower
castes, it purportedly violated the ideal of equality that was founda-

tional to Indian liberal democracy. Much of the public discourse on
Mandal rehearsed the virtues of castelessness as an ideal embodied by
upper castes and disregarded the lived real ity of caste discrimination

and exclusion that reservation was intended to redress.

Signifcantly, most of the ferment around Mandal was limited to

the north of India. The southern states, including Tamilnadu, experienced very little of it. Plus, the depiction of Mandal as a jolt into caste

consciousness was a striking contrast to the more long- standing and

pervasive caste hostilities in the south. The Mandal Commission
quotas were part of a sea change in the northern Hindi- speaking belt,

sparked by the po liti cal mobilization and consolidation of lower castes

under the “OBC” banner from the early 1990s. [51] The po liti cal rise of

Backward Castes in the north and the implementation of Mandal lent
“OBC” the same charge in the north that it had in the south. What the
Mandal Commission did, then, was to extend the southern dialectic
of lower- caste claims to rights and upper- caste claims to merit to the

north.

The 1990 OBC quotas catalyzed new lines of division and precipi-

tated more defensive, upper- caste claims to merit as the nonreserved.

The 2006 implementation of the second part of the Mandal Commission’s recommendations— the reservation of 27 percent of seats for

OBCs in all central educational institutions, including the IITs and
IIMs— exacerbated this oppositional dynamic. [52] Mandal II further en-

trenched the distinction between “the general” and “the reserved” as
a commonsensical and widely shared one through which the Indian
public understood caste difference. The ubiquity of the reservation debate and the proliferation of its terms is evident in everyday discourse
and on social media. While there are innumerable instances, I have se-


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 239

lected just a few that showcase the rhetorical fourishes of the antireservation position.

One example is from 2009, just after the announcement of Mandal

II. At the time, a joke circulated on the Internet. It went something like
this: “India decides to send a space exploration team to the moon. Feverish negotiations begin immediately on the composition of the team,
and after much haggling it is de cided to include nine OBCs, six SCs,

three STs, and, if there is any place left, two astronauts.” [53] The point

was to distinguish the caste- based from the meritorious. The OBCs,

SCs, and STs, who are defned purely by their caste markers, are assumed to be utterly unqualifed for professional positions and yet monopolize them because of po liti cal machinations. This leaves the upper

castes, who are the only ones actually qualifed for the professions,
sharing the dregs of what remains. Caste and politics on one side, accomplished individuals on the other. What remains unstated but assumed are the upper- caste identities of the “astronauts.”

Such assumptions about the undermining of standards through res-

ervation are more commonly expressed through comments about
“quota doctors.” IIT Delhi alumnus and best- selling novelist Chetan

Bhagat reprised this fear in a Facebook post where he played out a scenario ending with a rhetorical question: “Mr. A passed his medical examinations with more than 90 percentage marks in every subject.

Soon he became a fully qualifed doctor. Mr. B is Mr. A’s classmate.
He failed in every exam. But since he was from a backward (reserved)

class the university awarded him with a degree and the medical council
of India included him among the list of doctors. Now the question is,
if you are feeling sick, or injured or not well in some other way, to get
treated and cured will you fx an appointment for consultation with

Mr. A or Mr. B?” [54] The post was “liked” by over 5,600 people and shared

1,500 times.

A second joke circulated after Prime Minister Modi’s September

2015 visit to the United States. “Narendra Modi during his visit to
Amer i ca said to Obama, ‘Yours is the strongest and most developed

country in the world. What is the secret of your country’s success?’
Obama immediately said, ‘Indians.’ Modi was totally surprised by
Obama’s answer and asked, ‘How?’ Obama replied: ‘You take Reserved
Candidates whereas we take Deserved Candidates.’ ” [55] Here, the


-----

240 THE CASTE OF MERIT

distinction between the “reserved” and the “general” cuts even deeper;
the reserved are by defnition undeserving. Moreover, according them
primacy in education and employment has cost India its truly deserving citizens who have fed to the meritocratic West, where their
virtue is recognized and accorded value. Left unconsidered is the irony
of attributing this comment to Amer i ca’s frst black president, who is

himself a strong advocate of affirmative action.

There are also numerous comics that made the rounds in the late

2000s and 2010s. Three of them speak to the idea of reservation as an
upper- caste handicap and a basis for exclusion. The frst by a blogger

named Indianskoolstudents on the blog _On the Road to Justice_ is of a
baby in the womb who, in a perverse twist on the stigma of being born
lower caste or untouchable, wails, “Oh No!!! I belong to the general category,” followed by a prayer, “Dear Lord!! Please!!! Make me born as
SC / ST or to the max OBC.” [56] The second is from a website titled Hyd-

Masti and includes a set of reproduced antireservation comics. It replays the scene of Gandhi being kicked off a train, except here, the basis

of his eviction is not race in South Africa but caste in India. “Reserved
for OBCs,” says the aggressor, who literally boots the bespectacled
Father of the Nation, clad in a loincloth, out the train door. By implication, not only is reservation exclusionary, but it is also antinational.
The antinationalism of reservation is further reinforced by the elite
“Western”- suited and booted leg of the aggressor. A third replays the

distinction between legitimate upper- caste votes and illegitimate

lower- caste vote banks through the juxtaposition of two statues. The

frst statue with the words “Then” and “Vote” on the pedestal is of a
beheaded B. R. Ambedkar holding a copy of the Constitution. The
second with the words “Now” and “Vote Bank” is of an unspecifed,
prosperous OBC politician on whose shoulders Ambedkar’s head has
been transplanted. Through this juxtaposition, the comic appropriates

57
Ambedkar for the antireservation cause while bemoaning the corruption of politics by lower castes.

The fnal example is an online advertisement created by a group

called India Resists in March 2016 that targeted benefciaries of reservation. It features a girl who, accompanied by her father, goes to get a

college admission form. When faced with the choice of two stacks, one
marked “Quota” and the other marked “General,” the girl hesitates and


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 241

then picks up a “General” form. Her father is somewhat puzzled but

ultimately proud of her choice. The message is clear: the “General”
stack is for those lower castes who want to compete on their own merit,

the “Quota” stack for those who want the stigma of the handout. The

good lower- caste individual is one who opts out of reservation and in-

58
stead chooses the “fairness” of open competition. This, the ad announces, is the “wind of new thought.”

Through the prism of antireservation rhe toric, we see an upside-

down world where stigmatization and exclusion are the plight of upper
castes and reservation is a corruption of preexisting norms of equality,
fairness, and justice. But this is not simply about reestablishing a liberal baseline of equal opportunity and individual rights. What is unmistakable in these forms of antireservation discourse and practice is

the outrage at the disruption of the natu ral order of upper- caste domi-

nance. The self- immolations, the jokes, and the comics all express a

deep sense of injustice in the face of thwarted expectations. In the process, they reinforce the notion that only upper castes are truly meritocratic subjects.

The consolidated categories of “general” and “reserved” also have

a life beyond the campus. After the implementation of the 2006 quota,

private sector job recruiters who were always keenly aware of the JEE

exam ranking system became more vigilant about the cutoff for the
general category. Several lower- caste students who got into IIT Madras

through the 2006 quota recounted their chagrin at being pointedly asked
for their JEE rank at the fnal stage of campus job recruitment; despite
doing well up to that point, most never got the jobs. The more recent divergence in career opportunities for general and reserved category stu-

dents is in contrast to the trajectories of lower- caste students who got in

before the expansion of the quota. Unlike then, there is now a two- tier

system of employment which ensures that the achievements indexed by

59
the IIT pedigree are mitigated by caste ascription. Increasingly, only general category students are seen as legitimate holders of the pedigree.

_IITian Reactions_

Within Tamilnadu, the one institutional site where opposition to
Mandal was expressed publicly was IIT Madras. Still, IITians were not

well represented in the 1990s anti- Mandal agitations because the


-----

242 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Mandal recommendations did not affect them directly. As early migrants to the United States and to the private sector, IITians did not
experience the reservation of Indian public sector jobs as a signifcant
threat. The 2006 reservation policy changes, however, were a dif fer ent

matter.

The 2006 quota brought the reserved category up to almost half of

the total student population of IIT Madras. This increase has given the
“general category” within the IITs a new charge. Now, from standing
in for the unmarked norm, it is claimed as an upper- caste collective.

This more openly articulated claim to merit as upper castes echoes the
self- marking of Tamil Brahmins at an earlier moment. Now as then,

the embrace of identitarianism is driven by a new sense of threat posed
by lower castes. It has become more imperative to mark the “general
category” as upper caste so that it is not devalued by association with
the expanding reserved category. This is no longer a universalistic politics of merit; it is an explic itly caste- based one. [60]

The more openly defensive posture as upper castes is evident in the

remarks made by IITians about the 2006 reservation policy. We also
see a recycling of some of the legal arguments against quotas that we

considered in the frst section of the chapter. In 2009, I spoke with a
group of frst- and second- year students who had gained admission to

IIT Madras through the “general category.” I offer here a curated set of

their remarks:

student 1: I would be happier if they had reservations on economic

grounds more than caste grounds. I know people who are from per-

fectly normal families but they were not such good students. There

is no reason for them to be given benefts. I don’t think they were

disadvantaged growing up in any way, and I don’t see why they would

be given preference. So I would think a more economic basis of
screening people would be better.

student 2: See, there are many students who do not prepare for JEE

seriously because of the feeling that they have reservation. In my

plus-1 and plus-2 [eleventh and twelfth grades], I had many friends
who didn’t study and I asked them, “What are you doing all the time?”

And they said, “Why should I study? I have reservation.” It’s very bad.
student 3: The bad thing about reservation is some good people who

deserve to come to IIT, they lose their chances. Actually, 1,000 seats

are given to this reservation category and even though others are very

good, they can’t make it because they have to score 40 percent more

than the reserved students.
student 4: It is at least better in IIT. In local engineering colleges,

especially in Tamilnadu, if they have 122 seats, 100 are reserved for
someone or the other. Only 22 are there for us out of 122. Upper castes

are becoming backward castes now.

Unlike earlier statements about SC / ST students as marginal and in-

adequate that expressed the comfortable inhabitation of a campus
mainstream, these express a sense of a more immediate threat. They

are less about critical assessment from a secure vantage point than direct competition born of a sense of injustice and victimization. In
them, it is lower castes who are entitled. Moreover, class functions to
delegitimize OBC claims in par tic u lar. The overlap between caste and

class in equality is far more apparent with SCs / STs than with OBCs,

who are a more diverse constituency. By substituting caste with class,
upper- caste IITians seek to deny the clearest form of privilege that they

enjoy vis- à- vis OBCs.

While these interviews reveal the discursive contours of an upper-

caste identity forged in opposition to the “reserved category,” even more
illuminating are the debates on social media. The Facebook site IIT
Madras Confessions is intended to elicit anonymous posts from students who need to unload their hearts and minds for what ever reason.

Started in February 2013, the site is open to any and all “confessions.”
However, the traffic on the reservation issue was so overwhelming that
the site administrator made the executive decision to no longer post
comments on this topic. “This page is not for any hatred or debates on
one topic,” he announced, “but for general emotional confessions.”

In the posts that did make it onto the site, we see clearly how much

the categories of “reserved” and “general” have been internalized as
forms of collective self- defnition. One thread offered a particularly il-

luminating win dow onto the contours of campus debate. It started

with a post by a self- defned “reserved category student.” This post is

from February 23, 2013. I reproduce it here in full:

was a daily wage laborer). When I got the seat my family celebrated,

every body was proud and I was treated like a hero. I was unaware of

the repercussions I’ll be facing once I cross the IIT gates. It all started
when I told my rank to a se nior for the frst time, later on to my

friends. I could see in their eyes that they’ve already judged me as

incompetent and undeserving. Some of my batch mates debated zealously how they couldn’t get a better branch but a reserved guy got it

because of this unequal system. Some used to say “That fellow. He’s
so dumb. I guess he’s a category student.” I slogged my frst sem and
cleared all courses but I couldn’t sustain this as the years passed. I

funked a few courses and my CG reached rock bottom. When I’ll be
sitting for [job] placements I am sure I’ll not get placed before day 15
or may be before day 20. All the joy with which I came here has been

sucked out of me and all I am left with is degradation of morale. This
is the story of almost 90% of kids who enter this institute through
reservation. This accompanied by social stigma, humiliation, excruciating pain and adverse psychological impact. Half the students
either end up getting extensions or sem drops. . . . This is the shit we

go through in this other wise beautiful campus. . . . I tell you my dear

friends from upper castes, I don’t think you were ever reminded of

your caste or had any need to know much about it, therefore consider
yourself in de pen dent of all castes. But I, I am reminded of my caste

every single day, every single moment. You might proudly / or not

proudly say that you are a Mishra, Sharma, Varma, Reddy, Chowdary,
Setty, Iyer, or some other caste. What would your reaction be when I
come and tell you that I am a Dalit, Girijan or a BC? That’s the reason
I am writing this anonymously. To avoid being judged by my caste.
You turn your faces when someone talks about caste, but fervently

talk about reservations. Isn’t this a new form of discrimination? Did

we enter this college unlawfully? Did we do anything unconstitutional? Then why do you try to judge? Yes you could have got a better
branch; your friend would have got into IIT, if there was no such thing

as reservation. What crime did I do for you to blame me for that? Was
it my choice to be born in a lower caste? Was it my choice to use reservation? Wouldn’t you have done the same, had you been in my

place? Isn’t the whole point of reservation, me being treated equally?

Saying caste system must be abolished, isn’t going to help, my friend.

competence, incompetence is what you need to do. Even I have been

affected by my choice. I could not compete with geniuses like you so
I fucked up. All I need is social ac cep tance. I too am an IITian, I too

wrote JEE and prob ably there is some 30 or 40 marks difference be-

tween you and me. Should I be considered as shit because of that?

What’s the difference between your grand fathers who might have

called my grand father an untouchable? You have changed the name

to reserved candidate. Please don’t blame the system. If you have a

better idea for bringing equality, get into the government, and change
it. I am a human being and I have self- respect. Please keep that in

mind before becoming Judgmental.

#Jai Hind

This post is remarkable both affectively and analytically. It is

written as an appeal for empathy, recognition, and belonging. It is also
an indictment of the caste culture of the institution. As it moves between abjection and indignation, the tension of inhabiting an institution where one is made to constantly feel the intruder is palpable. In
his more critical moments, the confessor offers a systematic analy sis

of upper casteness as an affective disposition in which critiques of reservation stand in for open commentary on caste. This shift, he argues,
is no shift at all but simply “a new form of discrimination.” Far from
giving up caste pride and superiority, upper- caste IITians have simply

substituted “reserved candidate” for “untouchable.” The confessor also
challenges his upper- caste interlocutors to come up with a better solu-

tion for in equality than reservation and not resort to platitudes about

the abolition of caste. What is particularly striking about the post is
how clearly it maps upper casteness onto the general category and accords it social and ideological coherence. The notion of castelessness
is summarily dismissed as a fction that is belied by the treatment
meted out to reserved category students.

The post elicited ffty- two comments and an equal number of

shares. The range of reactions is very revealing. I showcase some representative examples here. One set of reactions was from lower- caste

students who chose not to avail themselves of the quota and called into
question the confessor’s characterization of reservation as a non- choice.

“ ‘Was it my choice to use reservation?’ ” one post asked rhetorically,

echoing the confessor. “Yes. I’m from a lower caste and I ‘chose’ to


-----

246 THE CASTE OF MERIT

compete in the General Category. Just saying . . .” Another offered a
similar remark supplemented with an argument in favor of caste- based

reservation that echoes and inverts Indiresan’s invocation of an “international standard”: “Even I was eligible for reservation but I
‘chose’ to compete in the General Category so that I wouldn’t block a

seat for reserved category guys. Now, if I wasn’t confdent of my rank

I would have defnitely used this wonderful opportunity. When the
MITs and the Stanfords have diversity clauses, it is sickening to see
the pseudo- intellectuals argue that reservations should be based on

economic factors alone.” Another student who did take advantage of

the quota gave the confessor a pep talk to not internalize the judgments
of his or her peers about the reserved versus the general: “One obvious
thing I want to put here. If you say there was hardly 30–40 marks dif-

ference between you and the ones who pass all the subjects here, then

why are you funking now? I would say, it would be better if you, as
soon as pos si ble, erase this thought of yours that you are a reserved can-

didate, and stop give a fuck to those who discuss about it. There are n

reserved candidates in insti who do better than many stud JEE rankers.

[personal experience ;)]. So wake up!”

Another set of posts called into question the veracity of caste dis-

crimination. One post that got the highest number of “likes” cast doubt
on whether ostracism was the real cause of the confessor’s academic

trou bles. “Are you, in all your senses, telling that despite paying proper

attention in the class, and despite studying regularly, you funked?”
After attributing failure to the confessor’s own lack of hard work,
the commentator reprised debates about caste versus class in order to
debunk caste as a legitimate basis for reservation: “Please stop intertwining economic background with caste. For every person with

reservation with non- ideal background, I can show you two with

better- than- normal background and two who don’t have reservation

with a poor background.”

A third set of commentators sought to rationalize the hostility of

the confessor’s peers through recourse to liberal arguments about the
irrelevance of caste at the IITs. One did so by rejecting the confessor’s
equation between antireservation and caste sentiment: “Dude, some
people discriminate u only bcoz u r a reserved candidate and got a seat
in iit with relatively less score in jee but not that u belong to so and so


-----

caste.” A second chose a more affective route to the same explanation:
“For a change, consider yourself belonging to the general category, and
your best friend / brother / sister couldn’t get in, but a random dude who

is well off and with a much lower rank gets in. Won’t you feel indig-

nant for your brother / sister / best friend? Won’t you feel even a little

bad?? It’s only human! It’s only natu ral!!” Another wrote a more em-

phatic defense of the institute as a casteless space: “All I can say is stop
whining in such a self- absorbed way! I hardly see anyone (student or

prof or staff) or anything (fa cil i ty, syllabus, grades, opportunities, place-

ments, et- fucking- cetera) discussing and / or discriminating based on

caste! IIT has one of the most liberal crowd. So, please don’t accuse and

bad- mouth the institute and every one in it, because you never know,

the sensations- from- IIT- hungry media may publish that this is the true

condition in IIT. And quote you for proof!”

We see in this range of comments the battle lines of the reserva-

tion debate. When they attempt to address the everyday casteism of
campus life, “the reserved” are accused of intellectual inferiority, laziness, hypersensitivity, lack of empathy, lack of self- regard, lack of re-

sponsibility, and disloyalty. Across the diversity of positions, what
comes through most strongly is the ubiquity of “general” and “reserved”
as forms of collective self- defnition and indices of evaluation. It is

these terms that have come to stand in for the consolidated categories
of upper and lower caste. Even the presence of lower castes who testify
to gaining admission through the general category does little to dis-

rupt these commonsense translations. In the standoff over expanded

reservation, upper castes have constituted themselves as exclusive
bearers of general category merit.

_Caste Recognition, Misrecognition, and Stigma at IIT Madras_

We saw in Chapter 5 how the distinction between “the gifted” and “the
coached” operated as a defensive response to the expansion of coaching
and the entry of students from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, who
did not ft the expected social profle of the “true” IITian. In this
chapter, we have seen how the “general category” worked similarly to
equate upper castes with the meritorious. When it came to “the
coached,” they were identifed through their use of the vernacular and

their supposed parochialism. But how were “the reserved” identifed?


-----

248 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Before we come to the practices of distinction through which “the

reserved” were set apart, let us consider the impact of reservation on

the overall obsession with ranking. With the extension of reservation,
the minuscule differences in rank were in some ways dwarfed by the

power of the cutoff mark for the “general category” of admissions. The
cutoff signifed far more graphically the end of “merit”; it signaled the
difference between the meritorious mainstream and its illegitimate
outside. The outsized importance of this distinction puts into play a
relentless diagnostics of caste to nose out those who were “the re-

served.” This, it turns out, was a very complicated issue.

I spoke with Udhay, a 1990s alumnus, about how people knew who

the quota students were. Were there open questions about caste, I

asked? No, he replied, “caste as such was not talked about. People

wouldn’t say, are you from this caste?” After further pressing, he re-

vealed that it was from the JEE rank. “One of the frst things you would

ask when you met someone is, ‘What did you get?’ The frst time everybody comes and enters the hostel, this rank thing is asked. So at that

time you would know. Suppose I ask you, what is the rank you got? I
know your branch. So, if you’ve got a low rank, and you’re in a desir-

able branch, I know it is because of the quota.” [61]

Madhavan, the “star teacher” who was a con temporary of Udhay’s

at IIT Madras, corroborated his recollections. “We all knew who the
SC students were and they were defnitely treated as intellectually in-

ferior,” he said. “We knew that in the JEE, the frst 2000 get in, then
you have the 1000s who don’t, and then after all of them come the SCs.

So there was a pretty clear sense that they shouldn’t be there but man-

aged to get in only because of the quota. Some professors would also

treat them very badly.”

The “outing” of quota students usually happened frst through the

circulation of information about JEE results. But there were all sorts

of other ways in which, in the absence of such information, “general
category” students still claimed to know who was admitted through
the quota. This sense of knowing without having to ask hinged on all
sorts of diagnostic practices through which the “truth” was revealed.

The frst and foremost clue was academic per for mance. Udhay

stated that there was “a huge difference between the students from the

general category and this group. The reservation category would


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 249

strug gle a lot more in academics.” But, he admitted, sometimes these

assessments were not actually based on known “facts.” “I think it was

also that there was this impression that students like these would be

able to do only certain kinds of things intellectually. Maybe not said

openly but I think it was understood.” Often, alumni stretched facts
to ft their assumptions. Most alumni admitted to the difficulties of
academic work at IIT Madras even while they singled out quota students as uniquely out of their depth. For example, Sharma, a 2000
alumnus, noted that “the kids who came in like that, the possibility
of you having a lot of trou ble is much higher if you were one of those

kids. And I’m not saying that’s true for . . . there are kids who came in

through that route and they did fairly well, but if you see someone who
is left behind, hasn’t graduated in four years, there’s a pretty good pos-

sibility they were not the regular students coming in because most of

the regular students, I have trou ble imagining they have difficulty

passing, it’s just not going to happen. But the special kids with . . . who

come in through the other route . . . do have trou ble.” [62]

We see in these statements a foregone conclusion about academic

per for mance. Quota students were by defnition less able than general

category students to perform well. Indeed, the same CGPA, or cumulative grade point average, was interpreted entirely differently depending on who earned it: “general category” students were assumed

to get poor grades because they were too busy having fun, while quota

students did so because they were not intellectually capable of per-

forming up to standard.

Because the presumed intellectual difference between the general

and the reserved acquired the status of uncontested truth, anything
that disrupted it caused signifcant discomfort. This was the case with
one person who was singled out by Madhavan. “The only SC boy I remember ftting in was Manikumar who was a Class 10 topper at DAV,”
he recalled. “He also got into IIT Madras through the SC quota but,
because he was known to have been a topper, we had to treat him differently.” Manikumar was a Dalit student who had excelled at DAV, a
CBSE school in Chennai with an overwhelmingly Brahmin student
body. Every year, a number of DAV students joined the IITs, giving it a

reputation as one of the most conceptually challenging schools in the
city. Manikumar had gotten a high JEE rank that put him comfortably

250 THE CASTE OF MERIT

within the general category. However, he had chosen to avail himself
of the quota because it allowed him a better choice of branch. Besides,

as Manikumar himself put it to me, “it was my right.” To his frustration, this became evidence that “I couldn’t make the cut. Even when I

pointed out that if I hadn’t taken a quota seat, one of them wouldn’t

have gotten in, they still pretended that I didn’t have the marks to get

in on merit.” [63] Manikumar’s own narrative of his IIT experience was
conficted. On the one hand, he identifed strongly with the Brahmin
peers with whom he had spent his school years. On the other, he was
continuously made aware of his own caste difference and admitted to
still being “rankled” by these memories. For Manikumar’s IIT peers,

there was much about him that defed expectations. To explain him,
some resorted to nurture and not nature. “He grew up around Brahmins,” Udhay offered, “and this meant that he set high standards for
himself. He wasn’t a typical Dalit.” In effect, Manikumar served as the

exception that proved the rule of Dalit intellectual inferiority. His presence did little to shake the reigning assumption that passing the JEE

without the quota was the purview of upper castes.

Another upper- caste diagnostic practice for identifying quota stu-

dents was offered by Shekhar, a 1999 alumnus. At frst he gave me a
more mystical explanation for how one could identify the SC / ST stu-

dents. “You knew. I don’t know how. You usually don’t go up and ask

them obviously, but even in my frst semester, I don’t know how I knew

but I knew who were the quota students.” When I pushed for clarifca-

tion, he followed up with a more concrete explanation. “Many of them
were from vernacular medium schools,” he explained. “And I know
this because I have worked with many of them in En glish remedial

classes. They didn’t even have a sense of basic grammar and construc-

tion. They couldn’t read fuently and comprehending spoken En glish

was a far cry.” I reminded Shekhar that he had mentioned the presence
of a number of vernacular medium students who got in through the
general category. Did they also face such difficulties in the classroom?
He paused and said, “No, that’s a good point. I actually have a number
of friends who were from vernacular medium schools but they were

from . . . they were not from rich families but they were from educated

families.” [64] With these twists and turns of logic, Shekhar managed to


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 251

hold on to his conviction that the need for En glish remedial coaching

was evidence of reserved status.

One fnal example of a diagnostic method revolved around the roll

number. Sagar, a 1990s alumnus, told me that one knew the SC / ST
students from their roll numbers. “Each student had a number, an ID
number. If a class had 60 students, there would be 60 ID numbers. In

almost all cases the SC, STs were the block of numbers towards the

very end because they got the lowest JEE ranks.” I asked Sagar if this

applied to every classroom, and he said, “Not always, but at least in

my class, I think it was.” Other students, however, called into question this correlation between roll numbers and quota students. “I don’t

think that was the case,” Mahadevan told me. “I mean, the SC / STs

defnitely didn’t mix with others but I don’t think their roll numbers

were also clustered together. Anyway, if this was the case, only the faculty would have this information, not the students.”

In these instances of diagnostic work, we see the play of recogni-

tion and misrecognition through which caste difference is produced at
IIT Madras. Upper- caste IITians latch on to certain “clues”— academic

per for mance, En glish language ability, and the roll number, to name a

few— which become overdetermined indices of one’s admissions cat-

egory and, by extension, of intellectual merit. Knowing that a student
gained admission through reservation subjected that student not just
to pejorative assessments of his or her intelligence but to other forms
of suspicion. Udhay recalled that one of his friends who was “from the
SC / ST category” was contesting the student body elections in the early

1990s. “I remember that he was actually discriminated against at that
time, in the sense that his candidature alone was scrutinized unnecessarily, like, would he be trustworthy to handle funds, etc. These were

questions that were brought up. These were not brought up with the

other students, with the upper caste students. That was defnitely one
clear example of discrimination. I even remember that he alleged that
he was being discriminated against because of his background.” I asked

Udhay how people responded to his allegations. “ People of course de-

nied that this was the case,” he told me, “but it was an open secret. In
fact, in our wing—he was one of our wing students—we felt that he
was discriminated against, but the others were saying that it was not


-----

252 THE CASTE OF MERIT

this reason, it was some other reason and all that, but this was in the
air, during that election. I remember it clearly.”

When asked directly about such forms of discrimination, many stu-

dents reiterated that there was a baseline egalitarianism at IIT Madras

underpinned by a culture of excellence. As Srikanth, a 1990s alumnus,
put it, “One of the princi ples was egalitarianism, people were like,

every body is equal and the only way I’m going to assess you is your

intellectual ability and nothing else matters. It doesn’t matter where

you come from.” [65] This pairing of equality and excellence, and the
bracketing out of quota students as an exception to both, harks back
to eighteenth- century republicanism and its soaring rhe toric around

birthing a new society based in an “aristocracy of talent.” Now, as then,
we see a naturalizing of hierarchy as the extension of legitimate differences in ability that are divorced from a broader social environment.
In the pro cess, excellence is rendered innate, as is its absence.

_Dalit Experiences_

Dalit students who gained admission through the quota system were

only too aware of these relentless diagnostic practices. While a few like

Manikumar chose to battle caste prejudice overtly, for others, trying

to remain anonymous was the more viable option. This was made dif-

fcult by the explicit and overriding emphasis on the JEE rank as the
marker of social and intellectual standing on campus. The effort to remain anonymous was even more challenging for students who scored
below a certain mark in the examination. These students had to un-

dergo a one- year preparatory course before being admitted to the insti-

tute, which made them conspicuously distinct from the rest of their
cohort.

Satish, a Dalit alumnus from the 2000s, spoke to me about the ago-

nizing contortions one would have to perform to avoid exposing oneself as a preparatory course student. “If you’re part of the preparatory

course,” he explained, “it’s very obvious that you come from a Dalit
background, and that can get in the way of how you experience IIT.” [66]
This was even worse than qualifying directly for the quota based on
your JEE results, he elaborated. For those students, “ there is still a pos-

sibility to escape getting marked up to a certain point of time. And up
to that time you’ll have the opportunity to prove that you can actu-


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 253

ally do good in academics. But if people know you are in the prepara-

tory course, I think that deal is kind of done.”

Satish’s experiences at IIT were an eye- opener. He told me that his

decision to take the JEE was almost unthinkable in his village. All the
children studied in vernacular medium schools, from where most went
on to local colleges or straight into low- paying government jobs. The

IITs just weren’t part of the local universe of possibility. But when he

heard about the IITs from an ST friend who was studying for the JEE,
he de cided to give it a shot. “I went and met him, and he gave me a list

of books that he thought were best to prepare for JEE. And because I

was living in this village, we did not have a big enough bookstore from
where I could buy these books. My father would go once in the month

to the district headquarters where his office was and I asked him to
get me these books.”

Satish’s JEE marks qualifed him for the preparatory course, which

he initially experienced as a wonderful frst exposure to the IIT campus
and to future friends. It was only once he entered his frst year as an

IITian that he realized what a minefeld the campus could be for a
Dalit. He learned very quickly to try to obscure his path into the
institute.

“I felt like an intruder at IIT,” Satish confessed, but it was less about

an internalized sense of inadequacy than about the culture of the institution, where “most people were upper caste but knew nothing about

caste.” Unlike more activist students, Satish chose to keep to himself
as a way of avoiding uncomfortable situations. “If you look at Rohith
or Kanhaiya,” he elaborated, “ they’re trying to basically force . . . not

exactly force but claim their identity and basically go outright and say
that this is me, and I think that what ever is happening is not good. I

never did that. I kept to myself, avoided confrontations; if somebody
said something, I would just listen to it and not respond. I think that
became part of my personality.” [67]

His quiet perseverance also garnered Satish a good job. However,

the placement pro cess was also a very challenging experience where,

once again, the JEE rank loomed large. Satish was one of the candidates for a job with an Indian private outsourcing com pany. The two-

stage pro cess consisted of a group discussion followed by an individual

interview. Satish fared very well in the group discussion on the place


-----

254 THE CASTE OF MERIT

of India within global outsourcing. Based on his per for mance in the

discussion, he was invited for an individual interview with the CEO.
This is where the trou ble began. “Before the interview, we had to

mention our JEE rank on a form and I wrote down that I belong to the
reserved category.” As a result, the entire focus of the individual interview was on this “confession.” “They wanted to basically understand if I felt inferior maybe because I came from reserved category, if

I had friends who came from general category, and generally how it
has shaped my personality and my educational per for mance,” Satish

recounted. “ After one point I think I became brutally honest. It be-

came a question of standing up for myself; the job itself became kind
of unimportant.”

Satish did get the job offer and was asked to meet again with the

CEO. “He told me that—he told me that you’ve done well in your aca-

demic experience within IIT and he saw a lot of potential—he basically
showed confdence in me that I’ll do great in his organ ization, but I

have to start talking to people, networking with people. . . . He told me

to come out of my shell and start interacting with people.” I asked

Satish if he thought the CEO would have said that to somebody who
was not from the reserved category. “I don’t think so,” Satish replied.

“It was very personal.”

The JEE rank also followed Satish into his second job with an IT

com pany. Soon after he joined the com pany, the man ag er invited Satish

and his team out for drinks. “He asked me my JEE rank and I just told
him the rank of a friend,” he recalled. Soon after this incident, Satish

was sent as his com pany’s representative to a campus job placement

fair at IIT Kanpur. There, he found himself among a number of other

IITians, and the conversation turned to JEE preparation and ranks.

We got into this room, three of us, and our man ag ers, and the whole

eve ning was spent on what their experiences were in coaching cen-

ters and what ranks they had. And I didn’t know how to respond,

because none of these people knew I come from the reserved cate-

gory. They’re looking for my reaction, they want to know where I ba-

sically prepared for JEE and so on. And I was deeply afraid, like, what
do I do in this situation? There is a steep change in the way people

perceive you once it’s out in the open. But I’m working on it now. . . .
I want to get to the point where I’m not afraid of it.


-----

CONTESTING RESERVATION 255

After Satish recounted these stories about the long shadow of the

“reserved category,” I responded by saying, “It’s so unfair that you
have to feel shame about this when the majority of people who get

into the IITs come from histories of privilege and education. It’s not
because they’re brilliant but because they’ve had advantages.”

Satish paused and then gently corrected me. “It’s not really about

shame. It’s more about how people’s perceptions change and how it’s

going to impact your day to day life, you understand? We have to assess: does it risk our friendships, our working relationships? So I think
a lot is at stake.” Hiding the JEE rank, he insisted against my interpretation, was not about shame but about maneuver. It was about navigating a treacherous caste landscape where opportunities and empathies were unevenly distributed and prejudice was structural. It was a

world in which achievement was seen as natu ral for some and impos-

sible for others.

So, what was the takeaway for Satish about reservations? He told

me that his relationship to reservations had shifted over time. First,
he thought that “reservation as a policy is insufficient in the sense that
it still does not make the learning environment very positive for students. It is hostile.” But, he continued,

I don’t think that’s actually the truth anymore. So many of my friends

who are from the SC category, majority of them are from rural villages where they did not have access to coaching or tuition, nobody
in their families was there to advise them how to prepare for inter-

views, they didn’t speak En glish well— and still, they made it to the

IITs. And in that sense, at times when I refect, I feel really proud of

myself, that I have made it to the big leagues. So in that sense, we have
an incredible story. It became a source of inspiration for me to go out
of my way and do even more brilliantly than when I was in IIT.

�

Reservation disrupted the tacit role of ascription by explic itly naming

caste as a factor in the JEE outcome. In setting aside a percentage of

seats for lower- caste groups, reservation policy sought to correct for his-

torically sedimented disadvantages. At the same time, by marking
only its benefciaries as caste subjects, reservation policy underwrote
the status of upper castes as emblematic of meritocracy. Initially, when


-----

256 THE CASTE OF MERIT

only SC / ST quotas were implemented, the claim to meritocracy was

expressed in universalistic terms that did not require an explicit defense of caste entitlement. At that time, only Tamil Brahmins, with
their regional hostilities, equated merit explic itly with caste culture.

However, this changed with the steady expansion of quotas in tandem
with the growth in lower- caste rights politics. With the implementa-

tion of Mandal I and II, upper- caste claims to meritocracy were no

longer simply universalistic; they became more defensive and explicitly identitarian in nature. The more strident identifcation with “the
general category” against “the reserved” expressed a consolidated form
of upper casteness irreducible to any one endogamous grouping.

Both universalistic and identitarian claims to merit were typically

articulated against reservation. More recently, however, some upper-
caste groups have demanded not the abrogation of reservation but its
further expansion to include them. We see the demand for inclusion
within the reservation umbrella, for instance, in the July 2015 claim
by Gujarati Patidars. [68] Following the Patidar agitation in Gujarat, a
number of other upper- caste groups began to agitate for inclusion in

the reserved category: the Marathas in Maharashtra, the Jats of
Haryana, and the Brahmins of Kerala. These demands for inclusion or

reclassifcation within the reserved category rest on a key assumption:
that the quota as a right to education and employment can be distinguished from the longer historical experience of social and cultural
marginalization and stigmatization. Instead, such claims are leveled
against the more recent history of re distribution, which they argue

have disenfranchised upper castes of their rightful due. What we are
witnessing is the appropriation of the language of injustice and redress
by groups who have been the historical benefciaries of caste. Much
like the 1951 judgment by the Madras High Court, such claims transform reservation from an effort to redress in equality to its very source.

By substituting a longer history of unequal material and symbolic capital with a focus on more recent efforts at re distribution, these upper-

caste groups argue that they themselves are the victims of injustice
who deserve redress from the inequities of reservation.

Let us now shift from these fraught dynamics within India to a dif-

fer ent terrain of maneuver. In Chapter 7, we will look at how diasporic

mobility to the United States has shaped the politics of merit. We

touched upon this in Chapter 4 when considering the outward orientation of IITians as an expression of exceptionalism. In what follows,
we will explore diasporic mobility in far more depth. How did IITians

abroad engage with the expanding quota system in India? Did diasporic
IITians feel the need to lay claim to meritocracy? And how were such

claims shaped by a dif fer ent national history of social stratifcation?

M ass coaching and reservations brought new groups into the IITs
and radically transformed the demographic makeup of these institu-

tions. As a result, the social profle of the IITian as part of an urban,
upper- caste middle class has given way to a more diverse student body.

In reaction to these trends, upper- caste IITians have attempted to shore

up their representative status by claiming the mantle of meritocracy.
This has involved a robust politics of distinction through which the
coached are distinguished from the gifted, and the reserved category
from the general category. In the pro cess, a consolidated form of upper

casteness has emerged and, in the context of Indian higher education,
acquired unique salience. We have also seen the role of Tamilnadu as
an impor tant pre ce dent in the shift from a universalistic to a more

identitarian expression of upper- caste identity. As targets of Non-

Brahminism and Dravidianism, Tamil Brahmins were the earliest to

frame merit as a caste claim. Their marking as Brahmins produced
forms of self- marking as a tactic of meritocratic claim- making. With

the spread of Other Backward Class (OBC) politics across India, this
shift to a more explicit caste politics of meritocracy has also spread.
At IIT Madras and beyond, the assumption now is that the general category is an upper- caste collective.

Through all these challenges to and defenses of upper- caste meri-

tocracy, mobility has remained a key mechanism of caste consolida-

tion and capital accumulation. We have seen in previous chapters how
mobility within India under the purview of the central government

contributed to the making of an upper- caste intelligent sia. It was pre-

cisely the caste capital provided by this mobility that was threatened
by the Mandal Commission recommendations and produced such a
strong backlash. But spatial mobility was by no means limited to na-

tional borders. Migration outside India has also been a long- standing

source of upper- caste social and economic capital. This was certainly

the case for IITians. As we saw in Chapter 4, IITians began to leave
India from the late 1960s for what they perceived as greener pastures.
In the very early years, these were brief forays for training in West Ger-

many and other countries, after which they would return to work in

Indian industry. But the pattern shifted once the United States came
into view as the principal destination for IITians. The post-1960s waves
of migration made up a more sizable, more permanent diaspora.

Migration from India predated in de pen dence. The late nineteenth

century witnessed the frst large wave of Indian migration to Burma,
Ceylon, Malaya, Africa, the Ca rib bean, and the Pacifc. The vast ma-

jority of these mi grants were lower- caste indentured laborers. This was

followed by a second wave of traders, clerks, bureaucrats, and professionals who went mostly to East and South Africa but also to the other
British colonies where indentured laborers had preceded them. A third
wave headed for the United States. There are clear differences between

the experiences of lower- caste laborers and upper- caste professionals

who began arriving in the United States from as early as the 1880s. But
despite the fact that caste played a signifcant role in structuring migration and diasporic life, the scholarly lit er a ture on the Indian dias-

pora to the United States might lead one to conclude that caste largely
vanishes as a social category beyond the bound aries of the Indian

nation- state. [1] Instead, the most salient forms of self- defnition appear

to be class, gender, language, religion, and nation.

The story of the IIT diaspora suggests other wise. The forms of ac-

cumulated caste capital detailed over the previous chapters were key

factors in allowing for diasporic mobility. Moreover, the professional
success of IITians in the United States has been hugely signifcant for
reinforcing the link between meritocracy and caste. With geo graph i cal

distance from India and from rising challenges to caste entitlement,


-----

260 THE CASTE OF MERIT

IITian achievement abroad once again appears as just that— self- made

success. Diasporic mobility has helped to once again force caste into
the shadows. However, the absence of caste as a public identity in the
diaspora does not preclude its structural and affective workings. If anything, the institutional kinship within the overwhelmingly upper-
caste IIT diaspora has become an even more potent form of capital.
Diasporic IITians have been at the forefront of efforts to sustain and
consolidate their affective ties and to make the IIT pedigree into a globally recognized brand.

Much of this work of branding has been driven by IITians in Sil-

icon Valley, for whom entrepreneurial success has further reinforced
their sense of being self- made individuals. Entrepreneurialism— and

that, too, being nonwhite entrepreneurial successes in a new industry—
has deepened their investment in a narrative of humble middle- class

origins in which the brain is elevated as the sole form of capital and
histories of caste are strikingly absent. U.S.- based IITians work to ad-

vance this narrative, not only in the United States but also in India,
where they have been vocal advocates of market deregulation and
privatization. Moving between U.S. and Indian contexts has entailed
a balancing act between the marking and unmarking of caste as the
basis of achievement. As we have seen, ongoing challenges to upper-
caste dominance in India have disrupted settled expectations and
produced a more strident defense of merit as caste property. The diaspora, too, is an impor tant weapon in this fght. By showcasing dia-

sporic success as the arrival of the global Indian, upper- caste

IITians render the strug gle for caste rights into a parochial— even

regressive—endeavor.

Understanding the transnationalization of caste is particularly

impor tant in the current moment, when the rise to po liti cal power of

middle and lower castes has partially obscured the workings of upper-
caste capital. Indeed, it is particularly productive to think about how
and in which contexts such capital is reconstituted. While in some
ways formal po liti cal arenas and the broader cultural sphere have wit-

nessed the entry of lower castes, elite education and the expanding private sector both within and beyond India have ser viced the reconsti-

tution of caste privilege by other means. In this sense, we might think
of elite and private domestic and transnational arenas as spaces of

upper- caste fight and retrenchment away from the pressures of lower-

caste politics.

Po liti cal scientist Devesh Kapur has argued that the immigration

of Indian professionals to the United States was one of the “safety
valves” of Indian democracy. [2] Because they could immigrate, the fght

over the distribution of po liti cal power and economic resources was

less contentious than it might have other wise been. Kapur argues fur-

ther that the specifc form of capital these elites possessed— advanced

degrees as opposed to land— made for easy “exit,” frst from state em-

3
ployment to the private sector and then abroad. Since this was a transferable form of capital, “exit” also contributed to the further accumulation of capital.

Kapur offers an illuminating and exhaustive account of the economy

and politics of transnational migration that argues for the necessity of
thinking nation and diaspora together. His work provides valuable statistical data on the social bases of migration, its economic effects on
India, and the forms of politics it engendered both in India and the
United States. What is less evident is how moving from one system of
social stratifcation to another infuenced the worldviews and practices
of diasporic elites. Specifcally, what did it mean for Indian professionals to move from a society where enduring caste stratifcation intersected with demo cratic change to a society where racial stratifca-

tion operated similarly? How did they respond to their own racialization
as U.S. minorities, and how did this experience shape their forms of
identifcation and strategies of accumulation?

In this chapter, I will build on existing lit er a ture on the Indian di-

aspora in the United States to understand the impact of transnational
mobility on IITians and of diasporic IITians on India. How, I will ask,

was upper- caste identity forged in the United States, where IITians

were positioned as both class elites and racial minorities? IITian diasporic experiences have to be understood in relation to the longer U.S.
history of race and immigration. The 1965 U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act marked a key shift toward official multiculturalism and

the representative power of Indian professionals. [4] This shift is key to
the status of IITians as an infuential subset of Indian professionals
whose self- fashioning is keenly attentive to the market for identities.

As we will see, their self- fashioning as ethnic entrepreneurs, helped

by the catalytic impact of the Silicon Valley boom and enduring forms
of transnational institutional kinship, has found fullest expression in
the marketing of Brand IIT. Moreover, diasporic IITians have leveraged
their status as fnancially successful global moderns to push for legal

changes, market deregulation, and privatization in India.

The success of Brand IIT has also transformed the meaning of mer-

itocracy by shifting the emphasis from intellectualism to entrepreneurialism. While upper- caste merit has always been about both intellec-

tual prowess and capital accumulation, the emergence of entrepreneurial
success as the clearest index of merit has produced new schisms among
IITians. Now it is the diasporic entrepreneur who is heralded as the
exemplar of meritocracy over and above the homeland IITian. Moreover, the elevation of entrepreneurialism as the most desirable form of
meritocratic value has crystallized a new pecking order of IIT campuses, with IIT Bombay on top. Toward the end of the chapter, we will

return to IIT Madras to gauge the impact of Brand IIT on students and
alumni. How, we will ask, have Madras IITians responded to this most

recent turn in the politics of meritocracy?

Mobility: Spatial and Economic

The IIT diaspora is an artifact of mobile capital. And as with coaching
and reservation, the Tamil Brahmin story was an impor tant pre ce dent

in the use of mobility as a strategy of upper- caste maneuver and ac-

cumulation. This earlier phenomenon anticipated later patterns of

upper- caste fight, frst from the public sector and then beyond India.

Spatial mobility has allowed for economic mobility away from the
demo cratizing pressures of class and caste politics.

As we saw in Chapter 3, colonial rule afforded Tamil Brahmins

unique opportunities to move from the countryside to the city and outside the region for employment. The mass exodus of Tamil Brahmins
to the city was facilitated by their unique relationship to land and labor.

Brahmins long embodied “the cultural model of elite be hav ior and style

among dominant peasants,” where the mark of entitlement required
“not putting one’s hands in the mud.” [5] This combination of a material
reliance on and symbolic separation from the land was paralleled by
Tamil Brahmins’ physical separation from other agrarian castes in the

space of the _agraharam._ Tamil Brahmin spatial exclusivity came in for
harsh criticism by the Non- Brahmin movement, “which strongly ob-

jected to restrictions on public access and sought to ‘de- sacralize _agra-_

_haram_ space.’ ” [6] Their own relative detachment from the soil, colonial

opportunities, and the pressures of Non- Brahminism propelled Tamil

Brahmins out of the countryside and into the city, where they sought
employment in the modern professions. The exodus was so rapid
and large scale that by the 1930s, the author of a colonial report on
Gangaikondan— a town in southern Tirunelveli district— could remark

7
that “the Brahmin thrives best in towns and the rural soil is uncongenial to his genius.” Anthropologists Fuller and Narasimhan echo this
conception of Tamil Brahmins in pointing out that urban Brahmins
“do not go back to ancestral villages to absorb their food and water or

hold family rituals— nor do they ever link their urban neighborhoods

to rural ones.” The reason, they argue, is that “for Brahmans, far more
than for non- Brahmans, status and identity are in de pen dent of where

In other words, Tamil Brahmins had come to contain spatial mobility as an ingredient of collective identity. they live. [8]

As we saw in Chapters 4 and 6, Tamil Brahmin IITians do fore-

ground spatial mobility as the condition of possibility for self- fulfllment

and professional advancement. In their narratives, the move from countryside to city, from the south to the north, and from the public to the
private sector are strategies through which merit is preserved against
the odds. Moreover, they characterize Tamil Brahmin mobility as a
form of cultural genius that expresses a ge ne tic predisposition to edu-

cation and a preternatural capacity for instrumental action. As we
also saw earlier, there is a palpable sense of victimization that accom-

panies mobility. In addition to being a theme in individual narratives,
this comes through in the aggregate in a 1994 study of IIT Madras in
which diasporic alumni indicated caste discrimination as a key push
factor in their decision to migrate to the United States. [9]

Contra these culturalist assumptions that are at once claims to

merit, these tactics are best seen in properly historical terms. The ac-

commodation of new practices within preexisting caste identities was
a by- product of colonial- era transformations in the meaning of caste

Tamil Brahmins took up this new model of caste by embracing professions opened from a question of lifestyle to one of birth and descent. [10]

up by the po liti cal economic transformations of the nineteenth and

twentieth centuries, leading to their dominance of South Indian public
life. The rise of the Non- Brahmin and Dravidian movements, and the

education and employment quotas they generated, propelled a move out
of the regional state bureaucracy to central government ser vices and

eventually beyond India. In addition, many exited the public sector altogether, a trend that was frmly established with the rise of the managerial sciences and the information technology sector, where they now
occupy the upper echelons of managerial power. While spatial mobility was certainly an impor tant strategy, it was less an ingrained cul- [11]

tural disposition than a reactive maneuver in response to the economic and po liti cal transformations of the day. Moreover, some and

not all Tamil Brahmins were able to avail themselves of these new

opportunities.

Spatial mobility helped to shore up Tamil Brahmins’ capacity for

capital accumulation in the face of oppositional demands for the redistribution of power and resources. The Tamil Brahmin use of mobility as a strategy and form of self- representation is a key pre ce dent

to similar trends across India. In the postin de pen dence period, dia-

sporic mobility emerged as a key tool for a wide spectrum of upper
castes looking to secure the conditions of capital accumulation in the
face of increasing lower- caste demands for repre sen ta tion within public

education and state employment. At the same time, the Tamil Brahmin
emphasis on education and intellectualism as distinct upper- caste vir-

tues has given way to entrepreneurialism as a new model of upper
casteness. In the pro cess, the Tamil Brahmin worldview now seems

outmoded, a shift that is refected in the rise of IIT Bombay within the
pecking order of IITs.

There are several push- pull factors that catalyzed diasporic mobility

among upper castes: Indian state developmentalism, the rise of lower-
caste politics, and U.S. immigration policy. Indian in de pen dence in

1947 occasioned the building of a “mixed” economy weighted toward

growing the public sector. By contrast, private sector growth was circumscribed and regulated by a system of quotas and permits pejoratively referred to as the “License Raj.” Until well into the 1980s, state

employment was the principal means of growing the middle class.

Until the advent of economic liberalization in 1991, private sector jobs


-----

BRAND IIT 265

grew at a modest rate, while jobs in the public sector occupied a much
larger share of employment.

The expanding public sector was paralleled by the growth in public

institutions of higher education. Over the frst ffty postin de pen dence

years, the number of colleges rose dramatically, as did the number of

students enrolled in higher education. Until the 1990s, when educa-

tion was opened up to private investment, the vast majority of these

institutions came under the purview of either the state or the central

government.

These two aspects of Indian developmentalism— the dominance of

the public sector and the growth of higher education— were key factors

in the formation of the upper- caste middle class, who constituted the

bulk of the po liti cal and social elite in the early years after in de pen-

dence. As we have noted, unlike landed and commercial elites, their
principal forms of caste capital— education and the white- collar

professions— were highly mobile. And it was precisely these forms of

capital that became targets of lower- caste rights politics. The aspira-

tions of lower- caste groups found their most voluble expression in the

demands for quotas in public institutions and the professional labor

force, which were previously monopolized by upper castes. Increasing

collective pressure from marginalized groups resulted in signifcant
shifts in social repre sen ta tion within the bureaucracy and public sector

enterprises.

In response to such challenges to their po liti cal and social hege-

mony, upper castes began to look to the private sector or outside the
country. Among diasporic destinations, the United States emerged as
the most desirable option after the mid-1960s because of changes in

U.S. immigration policy. While the trickle of Indian mi grants to the

United States did increase in the 1940s and 1950s, the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act opened the foodgates. The legal change was

in large part due to Cold War hostilities. In 1957, the USSR launched
Sputnik I and II into orbit, provoking panic in the United States over
the technological prowess of its Cold War rival. In response, the U.S.
government began a concerted effort to promote the study of science
and technology, most directly through an enhanced National Science
Foundation. Rather than training Americans, however, U.S. science
came to rely on immigrants for its development. The Soviet cosmonaut

266 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Yuri Gagarin’s successful orbit of the earth in 1961 was a key catalyst
in the decision to import technical labor. In 1965, on the heels of civil

rights legislation, President Johnson approved new statutes that aimed
specifcally at increasing professional immigration— most importantly

of scientists and engineers—to bolster the U.S. position in the space
and nuclear races. [12]

The 1965 act precipitated the transnational migration of highly

skilled professionals and students from India to the United States. The
Indian- born population in the United States grew from approximately

13,000 in 1960 to nearly 1 million by 2000 and 1.5 million by 2007; with
the inclusion of U.S.- born Indians, the numbers rose to 1.7 million in

2000 and 2.8 million in 2007. By 2007, the Indian- born population had

become the fourth largest immigrant group in the United States, behind

those born in Mexico, China, and the Philippines. [13]

It was also the most highly educated. Between 1994 and 2001, the

U.S.- born population with a college degree or higher stood at 26.5 percent,

compared with 70.8 percent of Indian- born mi grants. By contrast, the

percentage of college gradu ates in other foreign- born populations was

similar to that for the U.S.- born. The percentage of the Indian- born

with post– bachelor’s degrees was 36.8 percent— far higher than the

8.5 and 8.6 percent for the U.S.- born and other foreign- born, respec-

tively. As striking as these numbers are, far more so is the educational

gap between Indian- born mi grants and the Indian population as a

whole: while 71 percent of U.S. Indian immigrants had some col-

lege education, just 3.42 percent of Indians did— a more than twenty-

fold difference. [14]

This educational gap is even more stark when it comes to technical

degrees. In 2000, one United Nations estimate put the total number of
Indian expatriates in OECD (Organ ization for Economic Cooperation

and Development) countries at 1.93 million, of which 51 percent were

“highly skilled,” with gradu ate degrees from the uppermost echelon

of institutions. In comparison, the 2001 Indian census put the total
number of gradu ates at 3.7 percent of the population, while the number

with a technical degree or postgraduate degree was just 0.5 percent. In

1999, out of the estimated 1.5 million foreign- born U.S. residents with

the highest degree in science and engineering, the largest group was
from India, at 14 percent. [15]


-----

BRAND IIT 267

The U.S. Indian population is also better off in terms of per capita

income when compared to both homeland and host socie ties. By 2001,

the total income of Indian- born Americans had grown to over $40 bil-

lion, or 10 percent of India’s gross domestic product. This population

has also gotten younger over time due to the large infux of H-1B visa
holders from the late 1990s, all of whom are highly educated. After the

information technology boom, their earning power also consolidated
far more quickly than was the case with previous generations of migrants. While 33 percent of Indians who came during the 1990s were

earning more than twice the native- born median for 2000, only

17 percent of those who came during the 1980s were earning more than

twice the native- born median for 1990. These fgures indicate a rapid

pro cess of economic consolidation for Indian mi grants in the United

States. [16]

The highly selective character of post-1965 migration has ensured

that the Indian diaspora to the United States is a predominantly upper-
caste formation. This is a key difference between the late nineteenth and late twentieth- century migrations from India. Kapur puts it

plainly: “While mi grants in the nineteenth century came from poorer

socioeconomic groups and from poorer parts of the country and went
to (relatively poor) Southern countries, a century later virtually the

opposite was true— they came from richer socioeconomic groups and

from wealthier parts of the country and, with the signifcant exception of the large migration to the Middle East, went to industrialized

countries.” [17] Caste is a key factor underpinning this difference: upper

castes predominate in the latter wave, with dominant castes as the
second largest group, and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
making up at best 2 or 3 percent of Indian mi grants to the United

States.

In some ways, this pattern of migration has allowed for a less ex-

plicit defense of merit, because upper castes do not face the kinds of

demo cratic challenges that are ongoing in India. The highly selective

character of the diaspora and the illegibility of caste in the United
States has made it easier to draw a seamless equation between being
upper caste, being Indian, and having “merit.” It certainly helps that
the economic power of post-1965 mi grants has eclipsed the lives and

livelihoods of those who do not ft the image of the professional Indian.


-----

268 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Moreover, a subset of these iconic Indians— the IITians of Silicon

Valley— have been at the forefront of professional networking and image-

making to ensure that the Indian technical professional is immediately
recognizable as a global commodity. Their networks of affiliation and
accumulation work to reinforce the upper- caste under pinnings of

Indian technical merit even while caste dis appears from view.

Race and Indianness

Indians are currently one of the most affluent and educated populations
in the United States, yet they are also a racial minority subject to
American ideologies of white supremacy and black inferiority. As with
other minorities, Indian Americans have had to navigate the landscape
of American racism, where whiteness and blackness signify polar ends
of a spectrum of opportunity and belonging.

The migration of Indians to the United States began in the late

nineteenth century. By 1900, U.S. Census reports placed the “East

Indian” or “Hindu” population— mostly upper- caste Hindu students,

businesspeople, and professionals—at 2,050. Signifcantly, this number
did not include Bengali Muslim peddlers, who arrived in the 1880s to
sell their “exotic” wares and remained less legible to the law. From
1904 to 1924, Punjabi immigrants from rural peasant backgrounds arrived in Vancouver and were driven south to the Pacifc Northwest by

Canada’s “whites only” policy. Here, too, they encountered hostilities.

Following as they did in the footsteps of Chinese and Japa nese immi-

gration, Punjabi mi grants were subject to the “yellow peril” racism

sweeping the country. Dubbed the “turbaned tide,” they were targeted

by newly formed groups such as the Asian Exclusion League, which
demanded the termination of Indian immigration. Despite these ten-

sions, between 1907 and 1910 approximately 1,000 immigrants entered
each year, and by 1910, there were up to 10,000 Indians in the country.

During World War I, they were joined by Hindu and Muslim seamen

on British steamers who jumped ship to remain in the United States.
Legislation followed social hostilities: the California Alien Land Act of
1913 excluded Indians from landownership, and the “barred zone”
Immigration Act of 1917 stopped all Asian immigration except from

Japan. [18]


-----

BRAND IIT 269

In spite of the racial targeting of Indians as a whole, caste and class

proved to be impor tant factors in determining what form of discrimi-

nation they faced and how they responded. While those who came to

work the land, work in lumberyards, or work on the railroads bore the
brunt of physical attacks, educated professionals who did not confront
such direct hostility began crafting a racial politics that would distinguish them from their poorer compatriots, from other nonwhite immigrants, and from black Americans. As did Dravidianists in South
India, educated Indians drew on the work of Max Mueller and other
nineteenth- century ethnologists and linguists to argue in court battles

that they, unlike those of African, Chinese, and Japa nese origin, were

entitled to naturalization as white people. Between 1907 and 1923, sev-

enty Indian professionals gained citizenship on the grounds that they
were members of the “Aryan race” and, as such, of white, or Caucasian, origin. These “advances” were reversed in the Bhagat Singh Thind

case of 1923, in which the U.S. Supreme Court declared “Hindus” ineligible for citizenship on the basis that they were not “white persons.”

Although Thind identifed himself as a “high caste Aryan of full Indian blood,” the court ruled against him. The justices maintained that
“while [‘Caucasian’] and the words ‘white persons’ are treated as synonymous, they are not of identical meaning.” In this instance, they determined that the “scientifc” defnitions must be subordinated to
“common sense” understandings of whiteness. As a result, more than
half of the seventy had their citizenship annulled by 1926. [19]

In contrast to Indian elites who sought to maintain their status by

claiming whiteness, others found common cause with racial minority

populations. Historian Vivek Bald’s work illuminates what he calls
“the lost histories of South Asian Amer i ca.” These are the stories of

the Bengali Muslim peddlers, the Hindu and Muslim ship workers, and
the Punjabi Sikh farmers who came to the United States, entered into
interracial relationships with black and Hispanic women, and became

part of multiracial communities across many sites in the United States,
including New York, New Orleans, Baltimore, Detroit, and California’s
agricultural heartland. Their everyday lives are testament to a very differ ent narrative of South Asian immigration, which showcases

working- class solidarities across racial lines and the centrality of black

neighborhoods within histories of U.S. immigration. [20]


-----

270 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Bald had difficulty unearthing these histories because they are at

such variance to the more common story of elite Indian migration and
endogamous social reproduction. Having found them, he argues convincingly that we should not reduce South Asian American history to
the experiences of professionals. At the same time, Bald admits that
the politics of repre sen ta tion has worked in favor of the professional

elite, who have leveraged their power to challenge the mold of the
“undesirable alien.” Although the naturalization bill that President
Truman signed into law in July 1946 made all Indians already resident
in the country eligible for citizenship, Bald maintains that this was a
mixed blessing. As he puts it, “ these ideas— that U.S. Immigration pol-

icies toward India should favor scientists, engineers, and business-

people and be driven by national considerations of trade and foreign
policy— not only won out in 1946 but were eventually enshrined in the

Hart- Celler Act, which opened the door to tens of thousands of skilled

professionals from the subcontinent in 1965.” [21]

In some ways, the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Hart- Celler

Act marked a break with a past of racially defned citizenship. But to
what extent did the racial hierarchies of the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries cease to structure American society and politics?
Legal scholar Cheryl Harris questions the retreat from racial thinking
that is presumed to have informed post– civil rights politics. Rather

than marking an end to white privilege, she maintains that liberal discourses of formal equality have masked its continued operations.
Harris points in par tic u lar to the landmark judgment in _Brown v._

_Board of Education_ as a turning point for American racial politics
because it marked the end of legal segregation and the reemergence of

white privilege in a subtler form. “White privilege accorded as a legal

right was rejected,” she underscores, “but _de facto_ white privilege not
mandated by law remained unaddressed.” [22] Harris goes on to argue
that in failing to address the real inequities produced by segregation,
“the status quo of substantive disadvantage was ratifed as an accepted
and acceptable base line— a neutral state operating to the disadvantage

of Blacks long after _de jure_ segregation had ceased to do so.” [23] Other

accounts buttress Harris’s argument by showing how practices such
as preferential lending, redlining, and attacking affirmative action have
worked to secure “the possessive investment in whiteness.” [24]

These analyses of race in the United States strongly echo those of

caste in India. In both contexts, forms of caste and racial capital continue to stratify opportunity and status in the aftermath of legal

equality. Furthermore, as with Indian discourses of castelessness, the
language of race- blind equality has made it more difficult to track and

tackle the work of whiteness as inherited privilege. How have IITians
in the United States navigated these two forms of social stratifcation?

What has become of caste in its twentieth- century encounter with U.S.

racial stratifcation? Before turning to these questions, let us look more

closely at a subset of Indian migration: the technical mi grants who pre-

ceded IITians to the United States.

Indian Technical Migration: 1880s–1950s

We saw in Chapter 3 how, in the early twentieth century, Indian tech-

nical students sought to bypass the par ameters of empire through

transnational linkages to Germany and Japan. The United States was
also a target of this extraimperial set of aspirations.

Until the 1940s, technical students went to the United States de-

spite, not because of, the colonial state. In the face of meager colonial

state support for technical training abroad, aspiring students fell back
on family funds, fnancial support from nonstate organ izations, or

sponsorship by Indian native states. The importance of personal networks of kinship and patronage ensured that those who went abroad

using these channels were from educated, upper- caste families. World

War II occasioned a shift in this set of relationships between mi grant

engineers, American universities, and the colonial government. Ameri ca’s entry into the war enhanced its infuence in India both mili-

tarily and in negotiations over Indian technical training. The result of
these shifts was a new government plan announced in 1944 to send 500
Indians to Britain or the United States for advanced technical training.
The plan elicited a food of applications. Ultimately, the committee selected 600 students out of 9,000 applicants, more than half of whom
opted for the United States over Britain. [25]

The more active part played by the colonial state in sponsoring In-

dian training abroad changed the social profle of students going to

the United States. The students who had gone earlier were typically


-----

272 THE CASTE OF MERIT

from commercial and industrial families with a background in business. With the growth in state sponsorship, the students who went to
prestigious institutions like MIT were increasingly from families in

the employ of the colonial state. Although both earlier and later sets

of students were from upper- caste backgrounds, the World War II gen-

eration of mi grants was positioned to have the kind of infuence within

the Indian state and its industries that their pre de ces sors had lacked.

Historian Ross Bassett has written extensively about Indian tech-

nical mi grants to the United States. [26] While he takes care to identify

mi grant engineers as class elites, caste fgures less prominently in his

account. When Bassett does address caste identity and sentiment, it is
mostly limited to the early twentieth century and to upper- caste ef-

forts to overcome an aversion to manual labor. One story involves the

Amer i ca booster Saranghadar Das, who exhorted Indians “to use Amer-

i ca to re- create themselves and then to return and to create a stronger

India.” Bassett writes at length about Das’s advocacy, which combined
personal testimony with arguments about the benefcial effects of the
American social milieu for the cause of Indian nationalism. Much like
IIT alumnus John Abraham writing about his growing awareness of
caste in the context of 1960s Germany, Das wrote about Amer i ca as a

place where he had to rethink caste sentiment. An “idler” who had
learned to “hate every kind of manual labor,” Das found his prejudices

a liability in Amer i ca. After being fred from jobs because he lacked

basic manual skills, Das eventually “grew to accept and even revel in
manual labor. He cleaned toilets and served as a day laborer in a sugar

mill, bragging about his muscles as ‘strong as iron bands.’ ” [27]

This fascination with his own musculature provides an impor tant

key to Das’s relationship to body, labor, and nation. Unlike John

Abraham, whose German experience provoked critical refection on
the social hierarchies of caste, Das’s embrace of manual labor was a

means to a reinvigorated Hindu nationalist masculinity. For him, the
ultimate goal of such collective self- fashioning by upper castes was to

end British colonialism, not transform Indian caste relations. In a piece
titled “A Call of Duty to Young India,” he called on Indians to immigrate to the United States “ because we have been satiated with all

kinds of servility and we long for manliness.” It was only through diasporic experience, he argued, that Indians would be able “to develop


-----

BRAND IIT 273

the hidden resources of our continent,” to make goods “right in India
instead of importing them from foreign countries.” [28] As Das saw it, a
more robust Hindu masculinity would boost the productive capacities
of the nation and become the basis of economic self- sufficiency. Left

unstated in this call for a reinvigorated upper- caste self was its rela-

tionship to the lower- caste laborer.

As with aspiring engineers in India, elite diasporic Indians wanted

to move away from classical and literary education and toward tech-

nical training while maintaining their social standing. The Mas sa chu-

setts Institute of Technology’s motto— _Mens et manus_ (Mind and

hand)—with the mind prevailing over the hand, was uniquely attractive to nationalistically minded Indians who sought a technical education beftting their own emerging role as India’s future leaders. With

the founding of the IITs in the 1950s and 1960s, the path hewn by these

colonial mi grants became much more established. Not only did MIT

serve as an institutional model for the IITs (as we touched on in
Chapter 4), but migration to the United States for study became an increasingly more common option for IIT gradu ates. Unlike their pre de-

ces sors, most of these postcolonial mi grants settled in the United

States to form a permanent diaspora.

The IIT Diaspora

IITians were among the frst technical students to leave in de pen dent

India’s shores to settle in the United States. As we saw in Chapter 4,

training at the institutes had cultivated aspirations that they felt could
not be fulflled in India. The high rates of joblessness in the 1960s only
enhanced their growing disillusionment with the state and the public
sector. But unlike in the colonial period, IITians’ extraterritorial ambitions were hardly the result of state neglect. In the 1960s, public ex-

penditure at the IITs amounted to 16,400 rupees per student per year;
by contrast, regional engineering colleges spent 7,000 rupees for
their students. In addition, tuition at the IITs was a mere 200 rupees per
year. In short, IITians were some of the greatest benefciaries of the

developmental state. At the time, the cost of sending a student to an
IIT amounted to the per capita income of almost forty people. This

was a signifcant state investment made with the expectation of a


-----

274 THE CASTE OF MERIT

developmental payoff for the nation. [29] The patronage of the state also
extended beyond this educational subsidy. As we have seen, the vast
majority of IITians were the children of civil servants whose families

had long derived their status and professional identities from a connection to the state.

Despite these factors, the social contract between IITians and the

state implied in the educational subsidy was more honored in the
breach. IIT alumni very quickly re oriented themselves toward the pri-

vate sector as the only ave nue of professional development and self-

fulfllment. Unlike during the colonial era, when engineers typically
remained within their familial and familiar groove, these children of

middle- class civil servants realigned themselves and their expertise

with private sector growth either within or outside the country. Even

here, there was a difference between those alumni who stayed on in

India and those who left. Alumni based in India approached the state

pragmatically as a necessary partner without which little private busi-

ness could get done. For diasporic engineers, however, it was a dif fer ent

story. Those IITians who sought their professional fortunes in the

United States became more strident advocates of economic liberalization and private sector growth, and of limiting the developmental role
of the state and public sector. Key to this re orientation has been their

exposure to American antisocialism and their own entrepreneurial
successes in the information technology industry. These experiences

have fed an even more assertive claim to meritocracy, now at a global
scale.

In Chapter 4, we considered the reactions of the 1960s generation

of Madras IITians to the characterization of diasporic mobility as a
“brain drain.” While some agreed that the exodus of highly educated
students was inimical for national development, others insisted that

IITians’ diasporic successes had been crucial in changing India’s image
abroad. Opinion, in other words, was divided. However, as diasporic
IITians have consolidated their position overseas, the latter stance has
strengthened, giving rise to the argument that the diaspora is in fact a
“brain bank,” a vital resource from which India can draw. [30]

This shift has been occasioned by a much larger number of alumni

going to the United States. The majority from the 1960s cohorts remained in India, although only a few continued to go into the civil


-----

ser vices and public sector industry. In the 1970s and 1980s, the pattern

shifted. The emergent trend was for the top rankers of each cohort to
try for higher study in the United States, and then to either stay on in

academia or segue into industry. A 1988 study of IIT Bombay shows
that 31 percent of gradu ates settled abroad as compared to 7.3 percent

of engineers more generally. Moreover, the migration rate was much
higher in those branches of engineering whose entrants were most

highly ranked in the JEE and in their chosen courses of study. A 1994
study shows similar trends in IIT Madras: the percentage of alumni
who migrated to the United States grew from 20 percent in 1968–1972

to 22 percent in 1973–1977, 27 percent in 1978–1982, and 35 percent in

1983–1987. As with IIT Bombay, there was considerable variation across

branches of study, with the highest percentage of mi grants coming

from computer science, which was introduced in 1982 and rapidly became the most competitive branch. In 1986 and 1987, 58.5 percent of

computer science B.Tech students went abroad. [31] Over the 1990s and
2000s, most diasporic alumni moved quickly from academia to private
industry, where the combination of an IIT and a U.S.- university pedi-

gree guaranteed high- paying options. The 2010s witnessed another

shift, with the steady expansion of domestic and transnational private
industry in India making the option of staying home more attractive.
Those who did so typically did a stint in industry, earned an MBA at
the Indian Institutes of Management, then landed in the higher echelons of industrial management.

How did successive waves of IITians negotiate the sociopo liti cal

landscape of their new American home? How did their status as U.S.
racial minorities shape the conditions for capital accumulation and
their sense of themselves as meritocratic subjects? And what became
of the forms of upper casteness forged at the IITs once these alumni

came to the United States? It is to their stories and experiences and
the ongoing transformations of upper casteness that we will now turn.

IITians and Racialization

In their study of the IITs, historians of science and technology
Stuart Leslie and Robert Kargon quote a commonly used line: “When
a student enrolls at an IIT, his spirit is said to ascend to Amer i ca. After


-----

276 THE CASTE OF MERIT

graduation, his body follows.” [32] Another oft- told joke goes as follows:

“When Nehru set up the IITs, he said it was to produce engineers and
scientists who would help the country in its onward march . . . but he

forgot to say which country.” [33] Through the de cades, diasporic IITians

have continued to defne themselves as members of an educated middle

class whose migration was prompted by the corruptions of wealth and
politics. As Chatterjee, a 1980s alumnus, succinctly put it: “If you had
a family business, you stayed. If you were from a middle class family

and your parents were educated but not wealthy, you went.” [34]

In the early days, the pro cess of getting to the United States was

much more idiosyncratic. Unlike today, when the sequence of applica-

tion, admission, and migration operates like a well- oiled machine, older

alumni were far less aware and equipped with the resources to act on

their diasporic ambitions. Well into the 1980s, they had only a vague
sense of the United States before migrating there. What they did know

was that it was the place to go for higher degrees suited to the caliber
of training provided them in the IITs. Job prospects also seemed brighter
than in India, although most never intended to stay on in the United
States. When they arrived, depending on where they were, they expe-

rienced forms of isolation and discrimination that were utterly unfa-

miliar to Indian upper castes.

A typical story was that of Ganapathy, a 1980 Tamil Brahmin

alumnus who migrated to the United States. Ganapathy drew a sharp
contrast between the technologically connected, information- driven

world of today and the early 1980s, when he attended Drexel Univer-

sity in Philadelphia. “Information, choices, students today know what

they are getting into,” he said. “I don’t think we knew at all.” He mar-

veled at the memory of how little he and his classmates had to go on.

“When I went to Drexel, I did not have any clue what Philadelphia was.
I just knew I was going there, that’s it. All the information I had was

from a little prospectus that was sent to us. That was it.” Once he ar-

rived in the United States, contact with India was infrequent. “ Every

call cost in those days,” he remembered. “I landed there and I called

back from my friend’s phone and the AT&T cost was $3.20 for the frst
minute and then $2.50 or something for the second and $2.20 for the
third minute and so on. So I used to write a letter to my home and say,
I’ll call you on this Sunday at 10 a.m. your time, and then that would


-----

BRAND IIT 277

be a three minute call. I used to write down all the things I had to say

and then, you know, it would be speed talking!” Even media about India
was highly limited. “We used to pray for Indian news. Apart from a

which used to be sporadic in nature, we used to get little newspaper called _The Hindu_ _India Abroad,_
35
International Edition where the information would be about three weeks late.”

Like many others of his generation of mi grants, Ganapathy stayed

on in academia. Unlike most, he returned to India in 2000 after six-

teen years to teach at his alma mater, IIT Madras. I asked him whether

returning had been a difficult decision. He had always wanted to return, he told me, “from the day I left.” This was just part of “the inherently contradictory relationship” between Indians and the United
States. “Honestly,” he mused, “I believe that every Indian in the U.S.—

at least most Indians in the U.S.— always in their heart feel like they

should and want to come back. And prob ably every Indian in India in

their heart feels they should go to the U.S.” This “irony” was brought
home to him when he and his wife fnalized their plans to return.
“When we de cided to come back, we suddenly found that every body

was our friend. We got calls every day saying, ‘Hey, how are you plan-

ning to go back? Even we want to go back.’ And this was all before the
dot . com bubble burst.” What f nally tipped the scales for Ganapathy

and his wife was having a child and realizing that they wanted her to
grow up around family. Despite the money, they de cided that the so-

cial isolation and cultural alienation was not worth their while.

It didn’t help that Ganapathy got a teaching job in Mississippi. At

the time, “the only Indian thing you could get was a few packets of

fairly ancient, outdated Indian spices at a Chinese shop. You had to
travel to Memphis or to Birmingham, which was about a two and a half
hour drive, to either get to an Indian restaurant or to see an Indian gro-

cery shop.” His Indian friends tried to dissuade him from taking the
job because of the stories of racial vio lence. “I remember when I told

my friends about the interview there, they thought I must have gone

crazy. They said, we may not see you again, you may not come back.”
He even thought hard before purchasing a car. “I own a Honda,” he
said, “and I wondered, how will these people, you know, look at me if

I own a Honda? Should it be a Honda or should I buy one of the American cars?”


-----

278 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Although Ganapathy offered a frank assessment of southern racism,

he didn’t let the North off the hook. “I saw the same thing in Philadel-

phia,” he clarifed. “I’d be denied homes because the wife would take

one look at me, at the color of my skin, and say, she’ll call the husband

and husband will give an excuse not to rent me the house.” It was dif-

fer ent around the university, but renting a house “ wasn’t easy.” Even-

tually, he and his wife did rent in the Philadelphia suburbs, but not
before they looked in the city, where some friends had homes. “I went
to some places on 69th street and beyond,” he recalled. “We tried to
rent a couple of places nearby. We couldn’t do it. I mean, they were a

very tight community. They didn’t want any of us nearby. But all they

had to do was go two blocks and the black community started . . . so

there was no reason for them to feel so motivated, yet they were.”

Signifcantly, the sharper distinction in Philadelphia between white

and nonwhite, with Indians falling frmly on the nonwhite side of the
boundary, contrasted with Ganapathy’s experience in Mississippi.
There, being a foreigner made all the difference. He told me a story featuring his wife. “In Mississippi, my wife had a tough time getting a
job in the university. Fi nally, she found a job with a Fortune 200 com-

pany which was quite far away in a small town where there’s only one

big plant that made these things for tube lights, neon lamps. So she

noticed that blacks were not allowed to park in the inner circle, even

as late as 1992, ’93.” I asked Ganapathy if this was just understood or
if there were written rules. “It wasn’t written but they just wouldn’t

get a parking permit,” he explained. “So she asked her boss, ‘Where do
you think I should park?’ And he said, ‘Of course, in the inner circle.
You’re not one of them. You guys are dif fer ent.’ So, that’s Mississippi

for you. But I don’t think that’s only in Mississippi.”

Ganapathy’s experience in Mississippi of being the exception that

proved the rule of racism was echoed by John Cherian, an IIT Kharagpur
alumnus who arrived in North Carolina before the 1964 Civil Rights
Act. His brother- in- law, then a PhD student at the University of Iowa,

urged Cherian to apply to its up- and- coming nuclear engineering pro-

gram. It didn’t take much persuasion, and in 1959, Cherian found him-

self a doctoral candidate in nuclear engineering in Ames, Iowa. Four
years later, he arrived in North Carolina to take up his frst job after

completing his PhD. While there were already quite a few Indians in

Iowa, Cherian found that at the time, there were hardly any in North


-----

BRAND IIT 279

Carolina. In the university itself, he was one of two Indians, the other
a professor of statistics who had arrived two years earlier. The year was

1963, and police crackdowns on civil rights demonstrators were ram-

pant. Cherian found himself in a racially polarized society where he
was a non- category. “My professor in Iowa warned me about the South,”

he recalled, “and I knew what he meant. He said North Carolina was
the most progressive [state] but nevertheless the South.” His frst moments as a visitor in the state seemed to confrm that North Carolina
was defnitely southern and that in the South, Indians were defnitely

black: “When I came in April 1963 for an interview,” he recalled, “the
University folks reserved a room for me at the Velvet Cloak, a new
hotel. When I got there at 11:30 p.m., lady behind the counter said,

‘Would you mind waiting until the man ag er comes?’ I think she had

no clue what it was that had shown up! I could hear her making telephone calls, and I didn’t want to be humiliated when the man ag er

showed up. I prob ably would have had a room because the University

made the reservation but I de cided to leave anyway. I had seen a YMCA

so I went there instead.” [36]

When he arrived in North Carolina to stay, however, he encoun-

tered a dif fer ent situation. “I had to fnd an apartment. I would call up

and they would say, ‘Yes, come and look,’ and the lady would open the
door and say ‘I’m sorry, it’s rented.’ Then I de cided to frst say, ‘I’m fac-

ulty at NCSU,’ and then there was no prob lem at all.” When I asked

him if he thought his profession was key to this change in attitude, he
hesitated, then replied, “Yes and no. Telling people I was Indian seemed

to have the same effect. As soon as they fgured out that I was a non-
white foreigner, they treated me very well.” In fact, Cherian stated
strongly, it was as if white southerners were trying to prove a point. “I

got the impression that the South was embarrassed to be mistreating
foreign visitors,” he explained. “They had no prob lem discriminating

against U.S. blacks, but they went to lengths to ensure that we were

fne. I think Southerners knew they weren’t doing the right thing.

Hudson Belk, for instance, had segregated bathrooms. I would go into
the ‘Whites Only,’ maybe as protest, and never encountered any
prob lem. There was a public swimming pool right outside the univer-

sity. Of course, there were no blacks swimming. It had water fountains

marked ‘White’ and ‘Colored.’ It was all very explicit but they didn’t

want someone from another country to think they did this with


-----

280 THE CASTE OF MERIT

every one.” To drive his point home, Cherian told me about a friend of

his, a fellow Indian gradu ate student, who had an experience similar

to Ganapathy’s when he moved from Iowa to Mississippi. “I had an
Indian classmate in Iowa who moved to Mississippi which was supposed to be far worse than North Carolina and there too he encoun-

tered the same situation. They were treated fne, especially if his wife

was wearing a sari because that was a clear sign that they weren’t

from here.”

While wearing a sari was an everyday practice, a more deliberate

politics of self- marking as foreign has been a long- standing form of

Indian immigrant maneuver. Sometimes it was even promoted at an
official level. A State Department memo cautioned Indians to prepare
for “certain unfortunate experiences” they might have in Amer i ca. By

way of advice, the memo indicated that “many” Indians believed that
“ every Indian” coming to Amer i ca should wear a turban initially,

whether he had worn a turban in India or not, as a way of establishing
that he was not African American. [37]

This education in American racism taught IITians how to navigate

the pitfalls and promises of life in the United States. Of course, their
experiences did vary depending on the socioeconomic landscape of
their locality. Nonetheless, there was a common thread of under-

standing that emerged: the path to social and fnancial security was
to avoid the taint of blackness. While professional Indians no longer
did so through recourse to whiteness, as had earlier elite mi grants, they

now leveraged class, nationality, and, most importantly, educational
achievement, to fashion themselves as members of a model minority. [38]
They were helped in this effort by changes in the landscape of racial

meanings in the United States after the 1960s and the information

technology boom of the 1990s and 2000s. As we will see, IITians played

an impor tant role in associating Indianness with intellectual prowess

and entrepreneurial success, in the pro cess constituting themselves

once again as uniquely meritorious.

Institutional Kinship

By the 1990s, the trend of going to the United States had become far

more widespread and well established at the IITs. As several alumni


-----

BRAND IIT 281

from that de cade told me, the only reasons to stay in India were to get

a job right out of college, to do a management degree at the IIMs, or to
enter a family business. There were also some who went into the In-

dian Administrative Ser vice, although by this point, there were no

more than a handful per cohort who took this option. Every one else

aimed for a higher degree in the United States. Udhay, a 1992 IIT Madras alumnus, explained to me how the application system functioned
to ensure maximum success. I excerpt our interview here at length: [39]

as: Did you have a pretty good sense of what universities you wanted

to apply to?
u: Very good. It was all almost written down like a manual for us

by our se niors. In fact, the entire application procedure itself was

amazingly coordinated. That was one of the reasons why the IITs had
a much higher percentage of students going abroad. It had nothing to

do with the universities preferring IIT students. It was the network.
It was the way the IIT students coordinated amongst themselves.
as: How did the coordination work?

u: We had the concept of “safes,” safe university, meaning if you’re

from this branch with this GPA, you would most likely get this
university. Let’s say I am the ffth rank in the department. If I apply
to my safe, nobody above me is allowed to apply there.

as: Because it wouldn’t be safe for you anymore?

u: It wouldn’t be safe for me. Plus, nobody so many ranks below me

or with a higher GRE score than me should apply to the same university. Say I am the ffth rank, and the sixth rank guy applies, and the
sixth rank guy has slightly better credentials elsewhere, maybe he
will get through. But he doesn’t even apply. So the university doesn’t

even get to know about him, right?
as: And every body subscribed to this system?

u: Every body actually subscribed to it at that time. But even during

our time, one or two violations of the system were there, like a

student would apply to a university that he’s not supposed to in a
very secretive kind of way, and then he would be rebuked by all the
students and he would be shunned. It’s his will, of course, his wish.

But the fear of being found out kept students from breaking the rules.
Also because there was not too much information outside anyway


-----

282 THE CASTE OF MERIT

available; the Internet was not popu lar at that point. So this network

was the only thing that was working, and you wanted to use it.

as: Were there tensions between departments over how this worked?

u: Yes, there were huge debates between one department and another

in terms of allocation of universities. They would say you should not
apply here. Or between the top- rankers and the other rankers. Often

the top- rankers would want to apply to a lower university, but then

the 10th rank guy, what will he do? So there would be heated debates

in our department saying, look, you are not supposed to apply to
this because you will get that. Now, that’s a risk that a top- ranker

has to take.
as: Why do you think every one cooperated? Was it a feeling that

every one from IIT should succeed?

u: In fact, we used to get a lot of help from our se niors, and we did

this for our ju niors also. For example, the IIT Madras student in a

par tic u lar university personally wanted his ju niors to come there. In

fact, even I wanted some of my ju niors to come, so when they wrote

to me I would say, you know, write to this professor here, try to give

them all the inside information that I had. I don’t know why, maybe

it’s loyalty to this institution, maybe it’s because we feel a bond with

each other.

This form of institutional kinship was strong enough that even

those who did not intend to go abroad participated in the collective
ethos of U.S. orientation. Prakash, a 1993 alumnus, was one of only two
students in his cohort who opted to stay in India. “When I graduated,”
he told me, “ there were two dif fer ent worlds: India and then the global

world. I stayed in India for emotional rather than rational reasons.”
Only Prakash and one other student in his cohort did not write the
GRE. “But I had a U.S. map,” he said with a laugh. “Every body was

applying to universities so if I didn’t know the U.S. map, I could not be

in the conversation. So I learned, okay, University of Wisconsin–
Madison is really good at this, University of Mas sa chu setts– Amherst

is a shitty school but you will defnitely get aid. Stanford you will never

get scholarship. Then there was Berkeley, MIT, state universities. So,

you have this map: what are the universities, where do they excel, what
does Cornell mean, what does CMU mean, what does UMCP mean,


-----

BRAND IIT 283

what is UMCP famous for.” What UMCP? I interrupted. “University of Mary land, College Park. CMU is Car _is_ ne gie Mellon. There was a

map in my room where I knew all the states, all the universities. I
didn’t apply but I knew who was applying where, how it was going,

what’s the game, how does it happen?”

It wasn’t just the students who were part of the game. So, too, was

the postman. “ After having lunch,” Prakash recounted with glee, “we

would wait for the hostel postman. When he arrived, there would be

ffty students cheering. And the postman, he’d been doing this for

years, so he could tell from the weight of the envelope whether it was

ac cep tance or rejection. And I’ve heard him talk to some of my class-

mates: what is your CGPA, what’s your GRE score? Why don’t you

apply to this university? Have you done this? Have you done that? The
postman knew more than any of us.” I asked Prakash about those who

didn’t take the GRE. What did they do? “At that time CAT was there—

the entrance exams for the Indian Institutes of Management— but it

was just MBMs who took them . . . _Mera Bharat Mahan,_ which means

‘Indian son of the soil.’ If you’ve de cided to stay back, you’re MBM. If

you do CAT, you’re MBM.” [40]

Institutional kinship, lubricated by acronyms and based on ranking

and compliance, extended into American university life and became
stronger as the diasporic fow of IITians increased. Unlike earlier gen-

erations, who often found themselves to be one of few Indians on
campus, alumni who arrived in the 1990s were usually in good com-

pany. Jayaram, a 1990 alumnus, characterized his entry into MIT as a
seamless transition. He applied to do civil engineering because of ad-

vice from two se niors in the previous cohort who had gotten admis-

sion into the MIT program. “It was a well- trodden path,” he said, “So

I knew exactly what to do the frst day I was there.” It helped that the

two se niors “ were right there walking me through. It wasn’t totally or-

ga nized but it was more in these informal ways that the very power ful

IIT alumni network worked.” [41]

Initially, the IIT alumni network worked primarily as an informa-

tion channel that facilitated entry into U.S. universities. As more and
more IITians flled U.S. engineering departments and facilitated the
entry of their ju niors, the IIT system accrued name recognition. By the

1990s, it was no longer uncommon to arrive at Car ne gie Mellon or MIT

or Cal Tech and encounter several other IITians in one’s program, even
some from the same campus cohort. Udhay arrived at Car ne gie Mellon

in 1992 with three other classmates from his IIT Madras batch. It was
the frst year that so many people from IIT Madras had gotten in, he

told me. “Many of us got placed way, way higher than what we were

supposed to get. CMU was way higher than my safe, in terms of rankings.” I asked Udhay if people at Car ne gie Mellon know about the IITs.

“Yeah,” he said, “at Car ne gie Mellon people were aware of IIT, my ad-

visor was aware of IIT. He had been in Texas, Austin, and had come
across other faculty who were IITians.” I asked Udhay if there were

students from other Indian colleges. “Among Indians, it was mostly
IITians at Car ne gie Mellon,” he confrmed. Moreover, the institutional

pecking order carried over from India and was replicated at a distance.
“One good friend of mine was from Osmania University,” he offered
by way of example, “and she used to talk about how she was always
looked upon as this odd creature in Car ne gie Mellon. She was a se nior

to me, she has made it much bigger in her career, she is the CEO of a

huge com pany and all that. So, obviously, once you’re at Car ne gie

Mellon, nothing else matters. But she used to always talk then about

how there was discrimination, that the IITians would think her

somehow inferior.” IITians’ intellectual superiority, Udhay stressed,
was very much about caste. “IITians think they’re born intellectually

superior, that other castes just don’t have the ability to compete with

us,” he opined, “and that getting into the IIT proves it.” Plus, he argued, this sense of caste superiority was even more pronounced among
U.S.- based IITians. “I think some of the same biases that we carry in

IIT are even more reinforced here because in the U.S. we don’t even

get to see other kinds of students. The only students you see from India
are pretty much ninety- nine percent upper caste. IIT itself is a fltering

mechanism. Migration to the U.S. is one more level of fltering.”

It was not simply the caste flter of transnational mobility that al-

lowed for IITians’ claim to intellectual superiority. After all, other pro-

fessional and student mi grants to the United States were also typi-

cally upper caste. Elevating the IITs to prominence took active alumni
advocacy. Once older IITians were established in faculty positions in

the United States, they worked to shore up the reputational weight of
the IITs relative to other Indian institutions. To give just one example,


-----

BRAND IIT 285

an IITian teaching at Duke University started a summer internship
program exclusively targeting IIT undergraduates in hopes of luring
some away from higher- ranked engineering and computer science PhD

programs. When I asked whether other faculty in Duke’s engineering

school objected to the exclusivity of the program, he responded, “Why
would they? They know that the IITs produce the best students and
that all the engineering schools in the United States are competing for
them.” [42] And, indeed, this pattern is not limited to Duke; IITians that

I have interviewed at Harvard, MIT, and Stanford are equally explicit
about their goal of admitting and hiring their own. This is not to say
that academic per for mance bears no weight for the success of IITians.

Still, the power of institutional kinship has been hugely consequential
in setting IITians apart, especially once increasing numbers of students
from other Indian engineering colleges, as well as H-1B visa holders
coming to work in the IT sector, began arriving in the United States.

Along with the enhanced reputation, the professional ambitions of

diasporic IITians have also changed signifcantly. Through the 1980s,
prestige was attached primarily to academic research and corporate employment. Jayaram recalled that the most common tales of diasporic
success were of “a top professor somewhere” or “a top R&D guy in a

place like Bell Labs.” Unlike today, “ there were fewer or no success sto-

ries related to entrepreneurship or even with re spect to mainstream

business. There was no Rajat Gupta, who is CEO of McKinsey, for ex-

ample. People who went to the USA in, say, the ’70s or ’80s were not

yet at the top of their game.” Until the 1990s, the image of the suc-

cessful IITian was still one that was largely in continuity with the late
colonial and early postcolonial years: an upper- caste individual whose

intellectual prowess allowed for lifetime employment in prestigious
institutions.

The Silicon Valley boom gave rise to a new model. Moreover, by al-

lowing for an unpre ce dented degree of spatial and economic consoli-

dation, it transformed what was previously a more piecemeal effort at
shoring up the meritocratic status of the IITs through networks of institutional kinship. But the rise of Silicon Valley also generated new
hierarchies and tensions among IITians. Money- making diasporic en-

trepreneurs, most of whom came from the northern IITians, became
the new emblems of meritocracy. In the pro cess, the distinction between


-----

286 THE CASTE OF MERIT

diaspora and homeland acquired new salience as a difference not just
in space but in kind. However, the elevation of diasporic entrepreneurship as the new mea sure of merit did not go uncontested. Even as

they appreciated the name recognition and enhanced global status
promoted by their Silicon Valley counter parts, Madras IITians expressed

ambivalence toward this new model of meritocracy. As we will see, as

with the distinction between the gifted and the coached that we explored in Chapter 5, these tensions between diaspora and homeland

have produced new cleavages among the “non- reserved.”

The Silicon Valley Boom

Jayaram’s insight into the gestation period needed for IITians to reach
“the top of their game” is an impor tant one. The IITians who emerged

as the biggest Indian names in Silicon Valley got their B.Tech degrees
no later than the early 1980s. Most did so in the late 1960s and 1970s.

The country they left was pre- liberalization India, and the one they en-

tered held out both the promise of economic success and the threat of
racial minoritization. It was also the early days of the computer revolution. Many IITians who came to the United States for advanced degrees in other branches of engineering eventually switched to software,
and almost all who did made their way from academia to industry.

It is clear from speaking to Silicon Valley’s IITian entrepreneurs

that they share a spatial imaginary of constraint and possibility. As do
other IIT alumni, they echo the refrain that unlike the wealthy or the
po liti cally connected who could always fnd their way, they of the

middle class were subjected to the limitations of a system that fostered

mediocrity in the name of democracy. But there is an added emphasis

that refects their assimilation of American economic ideologies. Several characterized the India they left behind as one where the IITs were

islands of possibility within a sea of socialist constraint. Compared to
India, the United States for them is a cap i tal ist land of opportunity

where merit fnds its due. Nevertheless, it, too, is not a uniform cartography. One key distinction recurred through the interviews: the contrast between the static, closed landscape of East Coast wealth and
the dynamic, open frontier of West Coast capitalism. Silicon Valley,
they told me, could only have happened in California.


-----

BRAND IIT 287

The two narratives— one set in India, the other in the United

States— dovetail nicely. In both, IITians are of “the middle,” endowed

with education but without other forms of capital. Taken together, the
two work to reinforce the idea of the IITian as a uniquely talented individual who is able to leverage his brain to overcome structural limitations and rise to new heights. While this is like the other discourses
of upper- caste intellectual merit we have considered, most importantly

that of Tamil Brahmins, there is also something new. Entrepreneur-

ialism has lent the claim to merit a dif fer ent charge. In the full em-

brace of technological innovation, a deregulated private sector, and
wealth accumulation as the basis of individual merit, IITians in Silicon Valley have become self- styled neoliberal cap i tal ists. This is a

signifcant departure from an older upper- caste orientation around

higher education and lifelong professional employment, frst in state
bureaucracy and then in private enterprise. Like their counter parts in

the IIT system, most Silicon Valley IITians are the children of civil

servants and public sector engineers. In one generation, they have
gone from being benefciaries of the developmental state to being its
most strident detractors. Moreover, they disparage not only the underdevelopment of the Indian public sector but the underachievement of
their India- based counter parts. As they see it, Indian conditions have

forced IITians who stayed behind to slip into mediocrity, with the

result that only the entrepreneurial, diasporic IITian embodies true
merit.

Naresh Bhosle was one of the earliest IITians to come to the United

States and is one of the best- known Indian names in Silicon Valley.

Bhosle graduated from IIT Kharagpur in 1965 and went to do gradu ate

work at MIT. MIT’s partnership with IIT Kanpur, along with the older
colonial history of Indian engineers at MIT, made it a forerunner in
admitting IITians. In his cohort alone, there were three IITians from

Kharagpur, Bombay, and Kanpur. Bhosle went on to teach at MIT and
then moved in 1975 to the University of Utah to head up its semiconductor laboratory. Although Utah “was a dif fer ent Amer i ca,” it was al-

ready known as a center for computer science research, so he had an
easy transition. After teaching there for fve years, and upon the urging

of the General Instrument Corporation, which had funded the university lab, he left academia to start a computer chip design automation

com pany. Four years later, in 1984, he moved to Silicon Valley. By 1989,

his com pany had gone public and Bhosle was a wealthy man who would

become a major advocate of Indian entrepreneurialism. [43]

In our interview, I asked Bhosle if he came from a business back-

ground. No, he told me, his family was full of educators. The one ex-

ception was his father, who worked as an engineer for the Tata Iron and

Steel Com pany (TISCO), an Indian multinational corporation founded

in 1907 as a branch of the Tata Group of companies. Bhosle had grown
up in the com pany town of Jamshedpur. It was inspiring to him.

TISCO had overseen “the transformation of a jungle into a vibrant
place in ffty years.” He attributed his exposure to the Tatas as the frst
step in his turn to private enterprise. Still, this early experience was
“vague.” The more immediate catalyst was being a teaching assistant
at MIT to Professor Bose, who started Bose Systems. “In one of the lectures designed for sharing experiences,” Bhosle recalled, “[Bose] spoke
about how he came to start the com pany, how he fgured out that the

market was ready, technology could be applied, and all that. I realized
that companies can be started by faculty members. So the notion that,
in Amer i ca, people with no money but with unique ideas could start

companies was established in my mind at MIT.” I asked Bhosle if such
a path was pos si ble in India. “No,” he asserted. “What I had in India

was a Bachelors from IIT. When I came out, I was a true engineer. I had
confdence that I could create things, but there was no money. In India,

the notion was that you had to have your own family wealth to start a

business. We came from the middle class. That’s not wealth. But in

Amer i ca, bright ideas were funded by venture cap i tal ists. Money came

together with ideas. . . . This was all Amer i ca, it was a new learning.”

Kalyan, a 1982 IIT Bombay alumnus, echoed Bhosle’s arguments

about middle- class constraint in India. For him, the experience of

IITians was emblematic of India’s limitations on success. Kalyan had
grown up in a largely Tamil Brahmin enclave of Bombay and came
from a family of highly educated professionals: his father was a chem-

ical engineer who worked for Unilever, India; his father- in- law was a

physicist with the Atomic Energy Commission; his cousin had gotten
his PhD from IIT Bombay. Despite this slew of credentials, Kalyan
characterized himself and most of his IIT classmates as “solidly middle

class.” “We weren’t the high class— these are not people who came to


-----

BRAND IIT 289

campuses in cars, right? I would say if you had a car, then you were

upper class. And you’d be lower class if your parents didn’t know En-

glish. And middle class would be, sort of classic middle of the road:

you didn’t have a car, you didn’t have a phone at that time, but you were

not struggling for two meals a day.” Kalyan’s categorical distinction
between educational qualifcations and tangible goods worked as a disclaimer of precisely the forms of caste capital held by most IITians. As
we have seen, the disavowal of educational capital as capital through
its contrast with other, supposedly more “concrete” forms is a common
refrain that underwrites the upper- caste claim to merit. [44]

Right after graduating from IIT Bombay, Kalyan went to the Uni-

versity of Virginia to do a master’s program in chemical engineering.

His work in mathematical modeling soon took him to software engineering. This was 1984, what Kalyan called “the frst innings of the
software boom.” Even after he shifted to software, he stayed on the East

Coast, working as a product man ag er in Washington, DC, and Boston.

Then in 1990, he quit his job and moved to California to join a startup com pany. What induced him to move from an established com pany

to a start-up? Kalyan acknowledged that this decision was in marked
contrast to his father’s life choices. “As opposed to going for the secu-

rity of a large com pany, which my dad had to do for family reasons, I

felt that I didn’t have to fall for the same thing.” Besides, he had a

“taste” for “smaller, more nimble operations.”

Both Kalyan and Bhosle characterized the move to Silicon Valley

as the turning point in their professional lives. For them, Amer i ca as

the land of opportunity was crystallized in the idea that business could
be the pursuit of the Everyman. But there was an added spatial dimen-

sion to their analy sis. Bhosle qualifed his rendition of American na-

tional my thol ogy by drawing a contrast between Boston’s Route 128

and Silicon Valley. [45] For him, Boston represented the Amer i ca of racial

exclusion and elite class entrenchment. By contrast, he told me, Silicon
Valley was smaller, but it was “open.” In part, this had to do with differ ent institutional and funding ecosystems. “In the Boston area, you

had Route 128 which was sponsored by Raytheon and government
funded defense,” Bhosle explained. “In Silicon Valley, the majority of
funding came out of the semi- conductor industry, the computer in-

dustry, plus venture capital.”


-----

290 THE CASTE OF MERIT

In addition to the funding ecosystem, there was also the physical

space itself. Unlike other cities, Bhosle pointed out, Silicon Valley was
“very concentrated and small. Around Stanford and Santa Clara, the
number of people engaged in startups is much larger percentage- wise.”

This meant a dif fer ent form of sociality. “You run into people when

you’re shopping, at school activities, they have shared experiences, they
learn from each other. It’s a very collaborative environment. Even the
landlords know how startups work, and they work with you. People

are willing to take risks with you: lawyers, accountants, every one.”

Kalyan offered a similar portrait of Silicon Valley but used it to draw

a contrast between diasporic and homeland IITians. “ There were cer-

tain people who were neither good academically nor had the skills,”

he told me. “And they worked in India. If you look at these IITians,

very few of them have really done well technically. If you look at the

Indian space satellite proj ect or the nuclear energy proj ect, or . . . look

at anything of any signifcance in India, IITians have not really con-

tributed much at all.” By contrast, Kalyan continued, IITians in the
United States had made their mark in the technology sector. This, he
maintained, was due both to the caliber of diasporic mi grants and the

open nature of the sector, especially in Silicon Valley. I asked Kalyan
if there were social barriers to racial minorities. “Maybe on the East

Coast,” he responded, “but even there, in the tech community, it’s a

lot more egalitarian. And California, it’s defnitely not there.” As a

fnal point, Kalyan echoed another of Bhosle’s arguments. “Software
is where you don’t need any capital. If I need to set up a petroleum plant

or a chemical plant, I better have a hundred million dollars, right?
Whereas software, all I need is a $1,000 laptop and I’m in business.”

One name that came up repeatedly in my interviews with Silicon

Valley IITians was Vivek Bansal. Many pointed to him as a trailblazer,
and Bansal himself was not shy about adopting this mantle. Like the
others, Bansal represented California as a space of realization. He arrived there in 1971 and found it strikingly dif fer ent from both Mich-

igan and New Jersey, where he had been previously. Unlike those other

places, which “ were mostly white,” in California “every body was from

someplace else. . . . There was no established local culture.” Plus, high

tech was upending the world of business. Bansal did very well in Sil-

icon Valley. He cofounded a com pany and took it public in 1987, be-

coming the frst Indian American founder and CEO to list a venture-
backed com pany on the NASDAQ. Since then, he has been an angel

investor in over thirty companies and become one of the most well-
recognized faces of Indian entrepreneurship. [46]

These diasporic narratives are striking in what they say and don’t

say. Within them, the material constraints to cap i tal ist success are

overcome in the diaspora but only in the postracial landscape of Silicon Valley. California, where there is “no established local culture,”

is cast as a frontier where entrepreneurial risk is the name of the game
and technical skill is valued on its own terms. As with other frontier
myths of wild, unpopulated spaces that hold out the promise of unfettered accumulation, IITians play the role of settlers who usher in a futuristic capitalism by leaving behind the Old Worlds of India and New

England. [47] Like in so many of the other accounts we’ve encountered,

middle classness operates as a disavowal of caste inheritances, but here

it also works to eclipse the racial contours of information technology.
More broadly, as in the stories of IITians in the 1960s U.S. South and
with other more recent deployments of the model minority trope,
IITian success in California functions as an alibi of a regional po liti cal

economy that is far from race neutral. [48]

Other Silicon Valley IITians had trajectories that were very similar

to those of Bhosle, Kalyan, and Bansal. After coming to the United

States to study, they switched from their chosen branch of engineering
to software, segued from academia to the high- tech industry, started

companies in other part of the United States, and then eventually relocated to Silicon Valley. Although Silicon Valley’s Indians were not

limited to IITians, IITians made up some of the early successes. Moreover, many of them were from IIT Bombay. The compounded kinship [49]

of being IITians from the same campus gave them a strong bond to
build on once they were in the same location. And they did so, not just

by accumulating economic capital but by advancing a new image of
the diasporic Indian as more than just technically savvy but as an entrepreneur. It is in the production of this image that we see the very
deliberate race work done by IITians to crystallize a dif fer ent form of

upper- caste merit.


-----

292 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Race and Re- ascription

The information technology boom provided the grounds for the production of a new form of racial ascription: Indian entrepreneurial prowess.
The beginnings of this proj ect can be traced to the 1975 presidential

address by Faqir Chand Kohli of the Tata Group to the Computer Society of India. A gradu ate of MIT who had returned to India in 1951 to

work in dif fer ent Tata enterprises, Kohli concluded his speech with

the following statement:

Many years ago there was an industrial revolution. We missed it for

reasons beyond our control. Today there is a new revolution— a revo-

lution in information technology, which requires neither mechanical
bias nor mechanical temperament. Primarily, it requires the capability to think clearly. This we have in abundance. We have the opportunity to participate in this revolution on an equal basis—we have
the opportunity, even, to assume leadership in this revolution. [50]

Here again we see the idea of information technology as the grand

equalizer, where the brain is the only necessary form of capital. This
time, however, it is yoked to an argument about resetting the terms of
global cap i tal ist history by upending existing forms of uneven devel-

opment. While this argument about Indian revolutionary agency was
foated earlier by people like Kohli, it was only fully leveraged in the

1990s in Silicon Valley. Between 1995 and 2005, 26 percent of U.S. tech

start- ups founded by immigrants had Indian found ers, CEOs, presi-

dents, or head researchers. The Indian immigrant share of start-up
companies outnumbered those of the United Kingdom, China, Taiwan,

and Japan combined. [51] By the early 2000s, the image of the Indian had
followed suit. In May 2000, technology magazine _Business 2.0_ opined:
“It’s safe to say that without Indian immigrants, (Silicon) Valley
wouldn’t be what it is today.” [52] In 2001, John Kenneth Galbraith, the

former U.S. ambassador to India who had helped to set up IIT Kanpur,
remarked that he had no idea that there would one day emerge “an In-

dian colony called Silicon Valley in the US.” Within that larger category of Indian high tech, IITians were the most recognizable subgroup.

Sandipan Deb depicts the aura around the IITian in characteristically
superlative terms: “The story goes that in those heady years, you just


-----

BRAND IIT 293

had to mention in your resume that you were an IITian to have ven-

ture cap i tal ists running after you.” [53]

However, the notion of the entrepreneurial Indian as a sure invest-

ment was not one that emerged seamlessly from IIT alumni reaching
“the top of their game” in Silicon Valley. It was consciously manufactured for popu lar consumption. Much of this effort was spearheaded

by IITians and coalesced in the formation of the Indus Entrepreneurs
(TIE), a networking group that began in Silicon Valley in 1992 and has
now expanded to include sixty- one chapters in eigh teen countries;

India has the second largest number after the United States. In its orga-

nizational form, TIE was set up as a nonproft organ ization that con-

nected people— primarily South Asians but also others— engaged in the

proftable business of high tech. Deep Parekh, a 1975 IIT Bombay
alumnus and one of TIE’s found ers, pointed out that the founding of

TIE proved to be valuable not just for those starting out in business

but even for established entrepreneurs, like its found ers. The very pro-

cess of forming TIE clinched the working relationships of those who

knew of each other’s professional success only at a distance. It also
clinched intergenerational ties as many of the older generation became
angel investors in fedgling start- ups. [54]

Once some of these TIE- mediated start- ups succeeded, the industry

began to take notice. But the organ ization’s found ers still wanted to

establish the idea of Indian entrepreneurship in “the minds of mainstream Amer i ca.” As Bhosle put it, “We— particularly Indians—we

were recognized for our engineering ability but there was always a

doubt whether we could be good businessmen, whether we could start

companies. Although many of us had succeeded by that point, there

was always this notion in corporate Amer i ca that ‘ these guys weren’t

anything but good technical people.’ We wanted to change that. That

was one of the very impor tant goals of TIE which we managed to do

by the end of 1990s.” In an echo of anti- welfarist rhe toric, Bansal added

that the result of TIE’s efforts was that Indians in Silicon Valley were

“seen differently, as people who engaged in self- help, not asking for

handouts.”

Bansal was the most categorical in his characterization of the new

diasporic Indian. TIE, he emphasized, was part of “a new Indian image
emerging.” Previously, “every body had assumptions about Indians, that


-----

294 THE CASTE OF MERIT

we were Third World, third rate, even if individually some were dif-

fer ent.” In the mid- to late 1970s, he continued, American universities

“became aware of a special breed of Indian who was doing very well in

places like MIT, Michigan Tech, and Stanford.” Still, it took until the

1980s for Americans to “become aware that there was a common thread

behind these people: the IITs.” Even so, “we were typecast as smart te-

chies. We had genes which gave us mathematical prowess. But it wasn’t

clear that we had managerial talent, or sales and marketing talent, or
fnancial talent.” At the time, Indians were still seen by venture cap i-

tal ists as a “huge risk.” Plus, “ there was a fear that se nior whites

would not want to work for Indians.” Although some IITians had succeeded as entrepreneurs, “we were seen as outliers, as freaks, the lucky

ones.”

It was only in the mid-1990s that the “foodgates opened.” With

TIE’s founding, the image of the Indian was expanded from techie to
entrepreneur. “Now,” Bansal concluded, “Indians have become a risk
worth taking.” Silicon Valley was key to clinching the image of the
Indian entrepreneur. “This is where the best of the best all over the
world compete,” he crowed, “and Indians came out on top. Nobody was
helping us but nobody was pulling us down either. So every one says:

wow, they know how to do this.”

Brand IIT

This narrative timeline of Indian American self- fashioning sets up di-

asporic entrepreneurship as the realization of a promise that was in
the making over several de cades. Part of the story was the IITian’s in-

tellectual skill. Another part was Silicon Valley as the space of American innovation. The combination produced Indian entrepreneurship
as a globally recognized value. But for Bansal and other IITians, the
racial inscription of Indians as gifted entrepreneurs came at a risk: the
overshadowing of the IITian as the epitome of Indian merit. Shoring
up the value of the IIT pedigree became that much more impor tant

once other Indian engineers and entrepreneurs became commonplace
in the United States.

The proj ect of inscribing the Indian as entrepreneur was thus ac-

companied by a second proj ect: branding the IITs. In their practice as


-----

BRAND IIT 295

com pany found ers and angel investors, IITians already favored their

own. Bansal admitted as much when he told me that he “was biased
towards IITians.” By the mid-1990s, he explained, “seven to eight people

a day would come asking for investment.” This volume of start- ups

required discernment. Bansal’s “standard answer was no” unless

someone struck him as particularly innovative. Typically, these were

IITians. However, it was not enough that networks of institutional kinship underwrote the fow of investment capital. IITians, especially
those in Silicon Valley, took it upon themselves to make the IIT an immediately recognizable brand. This unfolded in multiple stages.

First, they had to ensure that IITians fagged their pedigrees more

explic itly. “We looked at a number of people in very se nior positions

in a number of places in the U.S.,” Parekh explained, “and noticed that
their public resumes would not say that they graduated from IIT.
Their U.S. credential would be prominent but for India, they would basically just indicate an undergraduate degree without an institution.
So one of the frst tangible steps we took was to individually go to a
large number of people—at least 50–100 people— and encourage them

to put down IIT in their bios. For example, Victor Menezes, who was
at Citi Bank, was one of the persons. Raj Gupta, who was running

Rohm and Hass, was another person. This was the frst step in creating
that branding.”

The second step was creating an expansive sense of pan- IIT insti-

tutional kinship beyond the experiential bonds between members of
the same cohort or institution. Several alumni characterized the forms
of affinity linking IITians using the imagery of concentric circles. The
innermost circle was made up of hostel mates, then moving outward
were branch mates, batch mates, IITians from the same institution, and
f nally IITians across all institutions. But that last circle was not one

that emerged organically out of the college experience. As a 1982 IIT
Bombay alumnus, Kalyan noted that he felt the greatest affinity with
his own cohort and campus mates. But, he qualifed, “even from, say,
the IIT Kharagpur 1998 batch, I prob ably know somebody who knows

somebody and we get connected. So there are enough talking points,

shared experiences, camaraderie. But this whole thing about being

closer as IITians, that’s a more recent phenomenon.” This cross- campus

affiliation was necessary, Parekh added, because the IITs didn’t have


-----

296 THE CASTE OF MERIT

instant name recognition in the United States. “We realized that if we
continue to stay in de pen dent, with each campus having its own alumni

association, we will not get the leverage that we would get if we com-

bined them all together and created one common IIT brand.” [55] It was
only through branding that the IITs would be put symbolically on par
with institutions like MIT, Stanford, and Harvard.

The third step was to give material form to this pan- IIT sentiment.

In the early 2000s, Silicon Valley IITians created the Pan- IIT Alumni

Association out of California. In 2004, it was registered as a nonproft
public beneft corporation. [56] With the forming of the corporation,
Kalyan remarked with satisfaction, “the IIT network has become more
power ful than the HBS [Harvard Business School] network. IITians

help each other like I have never seen in any other network. My closest
friends are IITians: I socialize with them, their families, I hike with
them, we help each other’s kids in their professional careers. My busi-

ness partners in all my startups are IITians. If you belong to this network, there is instant credibility and trust. Pan- IIT has consolidated

the brand.” But what did it mean to make the IIT a brand, and why was
it impor tant to do so? When I pressed Parekh on why it was impor tant

to think of pan- IIT institutional kinship in terms of branding, he spoke

of the investment payoff. “Now, when a VC looks at someone’s resume
and it has IIT on it, they pay more attention.” Consolidating the brand
by unifying all the campuses under a common orga nizational umbrella

was intended to enhance the market value of an IIT pedigree.

The fnal step was media coverage. This was a conscious effort of

the Pan- IIT Alumni Association’s media team facilitated by preexisting

relationships between Silicon Valley’s IITian successes and the media
industry. IITians typically point to one piece of media coverage as the
tipping point, after which the IITs gained popu lar recognition in the

United States: the 2003 CBS _60 Minutes_ show that we encountered in
the Introduction. Bansal explained the pro cess that led to its flming.

A producer at _CBS_ had seen flmmaker Mira Nair’s _Monsoon Wedding,_
in which the groom, a U.S.- based IITian, returns to Delhi for an ar-

ranged marriage. “She and I met at some event,” Bansal recalled, “and
she asked me if I’d seen the movie. When I said yes, she said, ‘What’s
IIT?’ I said that I too was from IIT and could help if she wanted to do a
story. That’s how the _60 Minutes_ story came about.”

The _60 Minutes_ piece, which aired on March 2, 2003, is an IITian’s

pipe dream. After lauding IITians’ “brainpower,” correspondent Leslie

Stahl puts the IITs in perspective for an American audience by describing them as a combination of “Harvard, MIT and Prince ton

together . . . with a curriculum that may be the most rigorous in the

world.” As a fnal point of comparison, she says, “Imagine a kid from
India using an Ivy League university as a safety school. That’s how
smart these guys are.”

The piece features two IITians: for the diaspora, Vinod Khosla, co-

founder of Sun Microsystems and Silicon Valley venture cap i tal ist; for

India, Narayana Murthy, founder of the software com pany Infosys, who

is introduced as “the Bill Gates of India.” Khosla testifes to the impact of the IIT diaspora on American business. Describing the IIT as
“the hardest school in the world to get into,” he emphasizes the value
to U.S. business of an IIT education. “Microsoft, Intel, PCs, Sun
Microsystems— you name it, I can’t imagine a major area where Indian

IIT engineers haven’t played a leading role,” he states. “And, of course,

the American consumer and the American business in the end is the
benefciary of that.” To drive the point home, Khosla asks and answers
a question about job creation. “How many jobs have entrepreneurs, Indian entrepreneurs, in Silicon Valley created over the last 15, 20 years?
Hundreds of thousands, I would guess. For Amer i ca to be able to pick

off this human capital, these well- trained engineers with great minds,

it’s a great deal.” Khosla’s fnal salvo on the piece is a masterful bit of

image consolidation. “[IITians] are favored over almost anybody else,”

he argues. “If you’re a WASP walking in for a job, you wouldn’t have

as much pre- assigned credibility as you do if you’re an engineer from

IIT.” For his part, Narayana Murthy underscores the role of the IITs
within India as a beacon of hope. “It’s very easy to lose hope in this
country,” he says, “It’s very easy to set your aspirations low in this
country. But amidst all this, this competition among high- quality stu-

dents, this institution of IIT, sets your aspirations much higher.”
Murthy also notes that there is another way in which the IITs are

anomalous within the Indian context. “ There is no corruption. It’s a

pure meritocracy.”

The _60 Minutes_ piece is a carefully curated bit of publicity that fea-

tures choice quotes from prominent IITians and argues for diasporic

success as a natu ral extension of an IIT education. Above all else, it

is entrepreneurial success that is showcased as the inevitable outcome of the IIT experience. Stahl reinforces this angle by noting

that “students act like entrepreneurs the whole time they’re at IIT.

They run every thing in the dorms, which might be mistaken for cell

blocks if not for all the Pentium 4 PCs. They or ga nize the sports

themselves. They even hire the chefs and pick the food in the mess
halls.” With this bit of exaggeration, the message is signed, sealed,
and delivered: the IITs are islands of meritocracy in a socialist, low-
achieving country whose best and brightest are naturally attracted
to greener pastures abroad, where they are able to realize their full
entrepreneurial potential.

The early 2000s were a critical moment for media exposure. In ad-

dition to the _60 Minutes_ piece, vari ous magazines featured articles on

the IITs. _Forbes_ did a story titled “Indians of Silicon Valley.” _Business_
_Week_ came out with “India’s Genius Factories.” Together, all these

media events put the institutions on the U.S. mental map and helped

to consolidate Brand IIT. The fnal step was reaching out to the politi cal class. Although most IITians speak with derision about “poli-

tics” and see themselves frst and foremost as technical experts and
entrepreneurs, they have not been shy about cultivating po liti cal rec-

ognition. Indeed, their successes on this front are proudly displayed on
the website of Pan- IIT USA, the American branch of the Pan- IIT

Alumni Association. The home page cites House Resolution 227 passed
in the U.S. House of Representatives on April 26, 2005: “Gradu ates of

the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) in the United States have made
valuable and signifcant contributions to society in every profession

and discipline. IIT gradu ates are highly committed and dedicated to

research, innovation, and promotion of trade and international cooperation between India and the United States. The House of Representatives honors the economic innovation attributable to gradu ates of the

Indian Institutes of Technology.” The website also has laudatory quotes
from Bill Clinton and Joe Biden and indicates that Mark Warner and
Robert Ehrlich, the governors of Virginia and Mary land, declared May

as IIT Gradu ate Month. Rounding out the praise- singing are prominent

quotes from Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft; Jeff Bezos of Amazon;
and, last but not least, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen. [57]

Through all these efforts, IITians have made Brand IIT synonymous

with Indian genius and entrepreneurial success. That this work had
as its target not just the U.S. media, public, and po liti cal class but

IITians themselves is captured in a statement by Kalyan on the
“synergy” between Silicon Valley culture and the culture of the IITs.
“From very early on, there’s both intense competition and enormous

cooperation in IIT,” he told me. Kalyan characterized this combination of competition and cooperation as unique to IIT. “ There was a

level of cooperation which I’ve never seen anywhere else,” he said.

“None of us would attend classes, but we’d get together and one
person would study chapter 1, one chapter 2, one chapter 3, and we
would all gather in four hours and teach each other.” At the same
time, “every one was fully aware that they were competing for a

limited number of ‘A’ grades. That’s the sort of the enormous collegial
plus competitive spirit I don’t think I’ve seen anywhere else. Except

in Silicon Valley where each com pany competes fercely with the

other one for talent and for technology, but at the same time they’re

partners. So, it’s a very similar model.” [58] By equating the ethos of the
IITs with that of Silicon Valley, Kalyan and others cast entrepreneur-

ialism as the natu ral instinct of the IITian, a disposition born of

campus life and matured in diaspora.

Lost in this rhetorical echo chamber are the forms of inherited caste

capital and state patronage that have gone into the making of the
IITian. Instead, what we get is the image of the IITian as the product
of natu ral se lection who has an intuitive ability to ride the crest of con-

temporary capitalism. Absent as well is the changing meaning of
merit within the IITs. The earlier emphases on civil engineering for

state developmentalism in the 1950s and 1960s and on academic and
private industrial research in the 1970s and 1980s have been eclipsed
by a teleological account of entrepreneurialism as the realization of the
IITian’s true talent and transnational mobility as its necessary channel.

Transforming the Homeland

While building brand recognition in their host country has been a
longer pro cess, diasporic alumni have more recently begun forms of

outreach to the homeland. Many have contributed handsomely to their


-----

300 THE CASTE OF MERIT

alma maters as is evident in the array of IIT campus buildings bearing
alumni names and in the awards they receive from their home institutions. More recently, these ongoing forms of individual outreach have

been coupled by collective proj ects aimed at larger- scale structural

transformation.

One such effort has been spearheaded by TIE. “Building bridges to

the Indian subcontinent” was always one of TIE’s goals, Bhosle noted,
but it had to wait until they were well established in the United States.

These bridges consisted of one ultimate goal: cultivating an entrepreneurial ethos in the homeland. In 1999, TIE leaders debuted their
agenda in Delhi with a series of seminars on start- ups. Bhosle told me

that while many of the details— “what’s involved, how does it work,

how options work, how do entrepreneurs make money, how do investors make money, how do employees participate”— were “new concepts

to Indians,” the most startling was “the fact that you can start companies without having your own money.” The frst seminar was held in
New Delhi, where approximately three hundred people attended, in-

cluding a sizable proportion of government employees. After this debut

appearance, Bhosle and Bansal took the show on the road with the help
of the National Association of Software and Ser vices Companies. As

part of the effort to encourage entrepreneurship and provide funding
for startups, TIE launched chapters across India; there are currently

seventeen chapters in India and two in Pakistan. At the opening of its
frst chapter in New Delhi, Bhosle gave a speech, which he paraphrased
to me: “Freedom fghters in India earned po liti cal freedom for the

country. This was very, very impor tant. But po liti cal freedom is not

enough. People need economic freedom as well. To attain economic

freedom, you have to increase the total wealth in the country. It needs
to be spread, but without creation of wealth you can’t have economic

freedom. The government cannot do it. It has to come from grassroots
entrepreneurship. That’s what we’re here to encourage, teach, and help

grow.” These ideas caught on quickly, Bhosle continued, “but the legal

structure was a key impediment to the formation of venture capital.”
He explained the pro cess through which TIE collaborated with the

Indian government to transform the legal landscape: “Indian partner-

ship laws were old British ones where anyone who invested money was

a general partner. In order to form a venture fund, the partnership laws


-----

BRAND IIT 301

needed to allow for limited partnership where partners can lose money

without being liable for anything beyond that. Other wise, nobody will

give you money. We pointed that out and the government wanted more
detail so we put them in touch with the best lawyers in Silicon Valley

and they f nally changed those laws.”

Bhosle’s narrative of homeland activism characterizes the diasporic

IITian as a critical- change agent bringing India into the twenty- frst

century. Signifcantly, even homeland IITians are seen as not up to the
task. Lost in this account is the centuries- long dynamism of Indian

economic life captured in the work of historians and anthropologists
alike. [59] Instead, in a faithful replay of imperial lore, we have a Third
World economy trapped in the strictures of outmoded laws and habits
of thought that needs an external catalyst to free up capital. But even

Bhosle was mea sured in comparison with Bansal, whose rhe toric was

a perfect echo of the free marketer’s playbook. When I asked him about

the goals of his own diasporic engagement, he said without hesitation,
“to change Indian socialism and the leftist mindset by educating
people, to promote free enterprise and entrepreneurship against top-

down government policies and planning, and to foster liberty and self-
reliance.” His frst step was to work at the ideological level. He collaborated with an economics professor at the University of Michigan
to start a New Delhi think tank, which Bansal likened to the libertarian Cato Institute and the Ayn Rand– inspired Atlas Society.

Bansal’s antipathy toward the Indian state fnds vari ous expressions.

One is through his opposition to reservation, which he characterized
as “socialist” and “anti- meritocracy.” Parroting an oft- used argument

that we encountered in Chapter 6, he asked, “If they were to reserve

seats in medical school, would I choose a quota student to do my brain
surgery?” He then added his own summary judgment: “Reservations
take us back to socialism.” His own solution to unequal opportunity
was to start a second institution, Foundation for Excellence, with an
IIT Kanpur alumnus. The foundation grants scholarships to help poor
students pursue higher education in engineering, medicine, and computer science. Bansal made a point of emphasizing that unlike the undeserving quota students favored by the state, the foundation’s students were meritorious candidates— “in the top percentile of their

class”— who only needed fnancial help.


-----

302 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Bansal was not alone in his opposition to reservation. In 2006, as

the Indian Parliament debated extending OBC quotas to the IITs,
alumni in Silicon Valley or ga nized under the banner of “Indians for

Equality” started online petitions, street protests, and solidarity campaigns to make their opinions known and express their fear of “brand
dilution.” At one such protest, an IIT alumnus argued to an Indian reporter from _The Hindu_ that the Indian government should “leave the
IITs alone. . . . It is because of us that the West has recognized the worth

of India. . . . Remember, brand India is brand IIT.” [60] The notion that

lower- caste entry threatens the IITs’ institutional brand is a striking

instance of the possessive investment in upper casteness. With the
threat of lower- caste encroachment, IITians equate the market value

of Brand IIT more explic itly with being upper caste. Moreover, with

the invocation of the West as audience, IITians claim to be shoring
up the value of “Brand India” itself through the protection of upper
casteness.

The opposition to reservation feeds into diasporic IITians’ impov-

erished view not only of the Indian state but of IITians who did not
immigrate to the United States. While other diasporic alumni like
Kalyan offered some version of this assessment, Bansal offered the
clearest articulation of the hierarchy of diaspora and homeland. For
him, the “socialist” conditions of India were corrosive, even of IITians.

“The guys who stayed behind in India, what happened to them?” he

asked rhetorically. “It’s like day and night comparing them to us. In
India, through ’60s and ’70s, there was nothing. IITians in India, after

IIT they went into civil ser vice, foreign ser vice, or went to work for

the Tatas. That’s the way to power in India whereas here it was always

through entrepreneurship.” For Bansal, to stay in India was to be sucked
into the state system in a downward spiral from excellence to irrelevance. As a parting salvo, he echoed Rajiv Gandhi’s remark: “Brain drain
is much better than brains in the drain.”

Bansal’s vitriol against the state only faltered when it came to the

Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In fact, he dated his
more active involvement in India to the frst short- lived BJP govern-

ment under Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. “Vajpayee was the

best PM,” he pronounced. “He opened up the economy. He sold public
enterprises, liberalized airlines, fnance, telecom. I was involved with


-----

BRAND IIT 303

some of this, especially in telecom. We had a com pany of experts set

up at Stanford to advise the Government of India on privatizing the
telecom sector which they accepted fully. Vajpayee was very receptive.
I met with him four, fve times at his office and when he came to DC.”
I pushed Bansal on why he was singling out the BJP when economic
liberalization was initiated by the Congress Party. He responded that
while changes might have begun with the Congress, the pro cess stalled

until the advent of BJP rule. For him, a key consideration was each party’s attitude toward the United States. In his estimation, there was no

daylight between being pro- liberalization and being pro- American.

“BJP government was always more receptive,” he restated. “[Narendra]
Modi as well. Congress was by and large very anti- American. They’re

socialist, we’re cap i tal ist. Under Vajpayee, there was phenomenal

warmth between U.S. and India. Under Sonia [Gandhi], it was a civil

relationship. The warmth is back now with Modi.” Bansal’s embrace
of Narendra Modi echoes the long- standing intimacy between India’s

domestic cap i tal ist class and the BJP, which was an early critic of state

developmentalism and a champion of the private sector. As with other
majoritarian nationalisms, Hindu nationalism has long had a social
base among the upper- caste middle class. [61] Most IITians are the per-

fect combination of both constituencies, having emerged out of the
upper- caste middle class to become members of a cap i tal ist class span-

ning homeland and diaspora.

Bansal’s version of India’s postin de pen dence history and the place

of the IITs within it offers some key insights into the diasporic IITian
worldview. As his story goes, the IITs were a beacon of light within

the darkness of Indian state socialism, but IITians had to migrate to
the cap i tal ist United States in order to avoid slipping into the medioc-

rity produced by socialist conditions. Once in the United States, their
natu ral talents could fnd their best expression via entrepreneurial ac-

tivity while IITians in India languished, producing a growing divergence between these nodes of alumni. Even as diasporic IITians four-

ished and their excellence was publicly recognized, homeland alumni
devolved into anonymity within the steel frame of the state. Luckily,
the shift to economic liberalization allowed for new bridges to be built
between homeland and diaspora, links that were solidifed with the

rise of the Hindu nationalist, pro- capitalist BJP. In the pro cess, diasporic


-----

304 THE CASTE OF MERIT

IITians were able to bring the spirit of entrepreneurship to India and

cultivate a new generation of cap i tal ists who could once and for all

remove the nation’s shackles of socialism. With the guiding light of diasporic entrepreneurship, Brand IIT becomes Brand India. This diasporic liberation theology places the nation’s deliverance squarely in
the hands of the U.S.- based IITian.

IIT Madras and Brand IIT

Brand IIT has certainly acquired an impressive reach, and its effect on
perceptions of individual, institutional, and national value is undeniable. For one, the branding campaign has powerfully shaped student

consciousness at IIT Madras. Students in the late 2000s liberally used
the language of branding to defne their own value. Sandeep, a 2009
alumnus, pointed out to me that as an IITian, “you are branded as intelligent.” He went on to note that one’s branch of engineering was
hardly relevant to the value of the pedigree. “Once [job] placements
begin in December,” Sandeep explained, “you will see that every one

is going into fnance and business and marketing, even though they

haven’t done any related courses. Still, companies believe these people

are good enough. It is more about the brand name.” [62]

It is clear that branding has shaped recruitment at the IITs. The an-

nual event of the IITs’ job- recruiting drive makes big news in India. In

the last ffteen years, the number of private corporations that recruit
on IIT campuses has increased exponentially. Now, IIT gradu ates join

companies like Schlumberger, Shell Oil, Microsoft, McKinsey, Tata
Consultancy Ser vices, or Infosys for starting salaries that are consid-

erably higher than what their parents earned at the end of a lifetime of
work. This is intergenerational economic mobility at its most dramatic.
Although most IITians are the children of professionals, within a single

generation they have leapfrogged over their parents’ modest incomes
to earn hundred- thousand- dollar corporate salaries.

In India, the impressive salaries garnered by newly minted IIT

gradu ates have been characterized as the realization of the brand— not

just by IITians but also by the likes of Shashi Tharoor, former United
Nations under- secretary- general for communications and public infor-

mation. In a 2006 article, Tharoor commented, “ ‘Brand IIT’ has shown


-----

BRAND IIT 305

the way. In 2007, we must start to scale this up to the point where one
day ‘Brand India’ becomes synonymous not with cheap products or services but with the highest standards of scientifc and technological
excellence.” [63] This reference to an IIT education as a brand that has
shored up India’s comparative advantage in the global marketplace situates the IITs and IITians as the forerunners of a future Indian moder-

nity free of the social and po liti cal encumbrances of the past. But Tha-

roor’s comment does more. In equating India’s developmental status
with brand value, it reduces the social, po liti cal, and even ethical com-

plexity of development to market price. In the pro cess, the capacity to

attract investment and accumulate wealth becomes the preeminent
index of social value and intellectual merit.

Most homeland IITians also endorse the notion of Brand IIT as good

for the institution. As one faculty member put it to me, “The brand is
a kind of ISO mark, a mark of quality. You’re assured of quality, like

when you see a car ‘made in Japan,’ it immediately sells.” [64] Another
alumnus who is a managing director of a Chennai- based management

and consulting frm echoed Tharoor’s claim that “the biggest contribution of IIT (and largely by the IITians) is the brand that they have
created at the global level. The IIT brand commands re spect for capa-

bility and excellence of a very high order in most academic institutions, corporate circles across a wide range of industries, and even government. This success of the IIT brand . . . has increased the re spect

for India around the world. Of course, there have been other factors that

have contributed to the ‘India’ brand, but IIT has a reasonable share in
that success.” [65]

Apart from the embrace of Brand IIT, the impact of Silicon Valley

is also evident in forms of aspiration. When I asked students in 2008
and 2009 about their career goals, the role models whose stories came

up most readily were Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. There are no longer

professors or researchers, or even public servants, on these lists. But

unlike the alumni they admire who made their mark in the U.S. technology sector, these students use branding to bypass careers in tech-

nology altogether. Ironically, the very deskilling that Kalyan disparaged
as emblematic of homeland IITians has been precipitated by success
stories such as his. For most students now, entrepreneurship is much
more about the skill of making money.


-----

306 THE CASTE OF MERIT

The elevation of entrepreneurship is vis i ble in the creation of a mas-

ter’s of science in entrepreneurship and the student- run Entrepreneur-

ship Cell, or E- Cell, at IIT Madras. E- Cell’s found ers characterize

themselves as “a group of students passionate about startups and the
entrepreneurial journey” who aim “to make students and faculty ‘entrepreneurial’ in every work that they do.” In a near perfect echo of

Silicon Valley rhe toric, E- Cell proposes to “unlock students’ latent in-

ventive potential” and “bring together every one interested in the

startup world to help students best utilize resources to found or join
startups.” The group takes credit for “130 � Startups incubated, 150 �
Ideas Bootstrapped, and 250 � Internships Offered.” All in all, E- Cell

strives to foster an “entrepreneurship culture” at IIT Madras. [66]

These resonances between diaspora and homeland might suggest

that IITians in India have subscribed fully to the Silicon Valley model
of upper- caste meritocracy. However, a closer look reveals differences

hidden within avowals of institutional kinship. In 2008, the Pan- IIT

Alumni Association held a conference at IIT Madras, the frst in India
after the inaugural event in San Jose, California, and a second in Washington, D.C. The conference was an ideal setting to see the status of
the IITs on full display and, less obviously, to understand both the overlaps and the tensions between homeland and diasporic alumni. The
overarching theme for this frst India- based conference was nation-

building, with sessions or ga nized around six topics: research, entre-

preneurship, rural transformation, infrastructure, education, and innovation. The tenor of press coverage spoke volumes about the standing
of the IITs in India. A range of news articles covered the event with
hyperbolic titles such as “IITians Have Brought Glory to the Country,”
“IITians Have Created a Global Brand,” “ Every IITian Has Created 100

Jobs,” and “Bonding Back with the Best,” the last starting with the line,
“Some call it bonding, others call it networking but most call it family

get- together.” [67] The reportage foregrounded two issues: entrepreneur-

ship and India’s global image. Most articles held forth on the fourishing of entrepreneurship at the IITs as emblematic of India’s global
arrival, cementing the equation between Brand IIT and Brand India.

The intimacy between Brand IIT and Brand India was not only

trumpeted by the press. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh also
valorized the link between Brand IIT and Brand India as a way of


-----

BRAND IIT 307

marking the liberalizing Indian state’s own disjuncture with a past of
planned development. At his inaugural address to the conference, Singh
stated, “I believe it is India’s destiny to become a knowledge power and
the IITs have contributed handsomely in the country’s efforts to realize
this destiny.” Others offered other expressions of triumphalism. Ra-

ghuram Rajan, IIT Delhi alumnus and former chief economist of the
International Monetary Fund, underscored the importance of free en-

terprise for India, even at a time of global fnancial crisis. Cautioning
Indians not to rethink their commitment to economic liberalization,
he noted that “world over, the middle class has lost huge wealth in the

recent global fnancial crisis. Their attitude is now against free market

economy. But market economies are prone to crisis. South Korea faced

four crises since the ’60s but it has weathered them.” Rajan acknowledged the need for improving fnancial regulations but ended with a
rallying cry for capitalism as the only system that values innovation.
“Look at the alternative,” he warned, “a government owned system—
where the politician will be the patronizing personality. Recall where

India was and where it has come now. It is time for the middle class to

take along the lesser privileged sections so that the fruits of free

economy are shared by all.” After avowing his faith in the free market,

Rajan ended with a crowd pleaser. When he was an IIT student, he recalled, it was impossible to get corporate sponsorship for their ventures.
“We knew the reason later, because all the CEOs then were either from

St. Stephen’s or Loyola or Presidency; the IITians were still working

their way up. I’m glad that there are at least 300 IITians who are CEOs

68
of companies now,” he concluded to thunderous applause from the audience. With the invocation of the three institutions— one each in

Delhi, Chennai, and Calcutta— Rajan drew a contrast between the elite

gradu ates of colonial- era institutions and middle- class IITians for

whom the free market was the best tool for success. Totally absent in

this contrast were both the shared caste backgrounds of these student

bodies and the massive state support for the IITs.

However, not all IITians echoed the commitments to branding, en-

trepreneurship, or the free market that reverberated across homeland

and diaspora. Kalyanaraman, a 1966 IIT Madras alumnus based in
Chennai and one of the organizers of the conference, offered one expression of dissent against the mainstreaming of the entrepreneurial


-----

308 THE CASTE OF MERIT

model. In the midst of all the talk of Brand IIT, he saw his role as recuperating the less vis i ble homeland IITian. When I asked him about

how alumni activity in the United States and India compared, he said
pointedly, “In USA, it’s brand- building, here it’s nation- building.” As

examples of nation- builders, he offered a diverse list of alumni: an

ayurvedic doctor, a Reserve Bank of India governor, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, a school principal, a minister of
environment, a petroleum secretary, some journalists, the head of an
NGO working in primary education, and several others. “ These are all

IITians who have contributed to the development of the country,” he
underscored, “but all you hear about now is Silicon Valley.” One reason
it was easy to overlook the accomplishments of India- based IITians,

Kalyanaraman contended, was because many of them still worked

“with and within the system.” He singled out the bureaucrat for mention. “You don’t hear about such individuals but because these guys

were there working, and despite all the corruptions and prob lems and

the politicians, our country is still a good working democracy. Because

twenty percent of our bureaucrats are dedicated people.” Kalyanaraman

acknowledged that an increasing number of diasporic IITians were now

interested in “giving back,” as evidenced in the theme of the conference. But, he continued, none of this could happen without IITians
based in India. “We are trying to be a link,” he explained, “ because,

all said and done, we need to leverage the government to have any real
impact and they [diasporic IITians] have forgotten how to navigate
India.” [69]

The divergence between diasporic and homeland attitudes toward

state and nation was also evident in my conversations with past directors of the IITs. In an echo of late colonial nationalism, one former director of IIT Madras opined that while “global connectivity is important,” national self- sufficiency must still be of paramount importance.

“At the very least,” he insisted, “it should be a system of give and take.
What do we give? As Mahatma Gandhi said, we sell cotton and buy
cloth. Even now, we sell raw materials and buy steel. This has to
change.” Another former director made the additional point that the
IITs should remain public institutions. In the 1980s, he told me, IIT
Madras was often forced to cut through red tape to get anything done.
“ Every so often,” he recalled, “we had to go to Delhi, talk to people,


-----

BRAND IIT 309

cajole them and ask for money. And all the time, it was ‘Why do you
need this? Why do you need that?’ ” Even efforts to raise in de pen dent

funds proved difficult. “When our faculty earned money through consultancies,” he continued, “the Government of India said, ‘ We’ll adjust

it against your bud get.’ When alumni wanted to give us money from

the U.S., the government said, ‘ We’ll adjust it against your bud get.’ ”

Things reached a head in the early 2000s, when the OBC reservations
were being debated in parliament. “The alumni got so fed up,” he recalled, “that some of them contacted the Government of India and said,
hand over the IITs to us. We will run it from the U.S. and we won’t ask

you for a single paise. They were going to form a consortium to take

over the original fve IITs. Immediately the Government of India
panicked and said, no, no, no, the IITs are our property. Then the doors
opened and they stopped asking so many questions.” Despite all

this— his frustrations as director, his strident opposition to Mandal,

and his appreciation for diasporic alumni support— the director con-

cluded that the IITs should nevertheless remain public. When I pressed
for an explanation, he offered his view of state and market. “The private sector sometimes responds violently to market fuctuations,” he
said, “whereas the government has a sense of commitment. Last year
when the American economy collapsed, Chidambaram was still the
Finance Minister and he stated publicly that bank deposits were safe

because of government regulations. We need that. We need that umbilical cord. We can’t cut it fully.” He then went on to depict a dif fer ent

structure of feeling binding state and citizenry in India. “I don’t think

the country is used to the American kind of system at all. We’ve always been governed by kings and now by the government. You know
what the villa gers in the north call the government? _Mai Baap,_ our

mother and father. So, so long as people have that attitude, the govern-

ment cannot cut itself off.” [70] With this combination of a populist and
a cultural rationale, the director came down on the side of stable, secure, even paternalistic government as a necessary foundation for India
and for the IITs. This was a far cry from the hypervaluing of risk, innovation, and rapid accumulation by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, as
well as from Raghuram Rajan’s fdelity to the free market.

The “umbilical cord” also came up in the comments of other home-

land alumni when talking about IITians’ relationship to India. One of

the showcase events of the conference was the release by Manmohan
Singh of an Internet- based survey of alumni, _The IIT Alumni Impact_

_Study, 2008._ The study’s data on alumni career trajectories added up

to a glowing success story. Signifcantly, a key emphasis was the impact of alumni in and on India, captured in information such as the
following: among IIT alumni who are in “top leadership roles,” almost
70 percent are based in India, with a third having returned after stints

abroad; 54 percent of the top 500 Indian companies have at least one

IIT alumnus on their board of directors; of the 17 percent in research

and education, mostly in the technology sector, half are based in India;
9 percent are engaged in “social transformation work” in NGOs, gov-

ernment administration, or politics; and 9 percent are entrepreneurs,

with 41 percent having founded more than one com pany, two thirds

of which are in India. [71] These numbers were cited repeatedly in re-

sponses given by homeland alumni to the press, often to correct journalist assumptions about the “brain drain.” In conversations with me,
India- based alumni were quick to point to the study as vindication

against the diasporic hijacking of the IIT story. Many also gestured to
their own decisions to return to India as implicit criticism of diasporic
acquisitiveness and evidence of their own stronger “cultural values.”

Just as Brand IIT and attitudes toward the government produced

differences of opinion among alumni, so too did entrepreneurship.
Several IIT Madras faculty attributed a decline in students’ research
orientation and their interest in par tic u lar branches of study to the

overemphasis on entrepreneurship. The “entrepreneurship craze,” they
told me, was both a threat to the intellectual standing of the institution and demoralizing for faculty whose students were far more inter-

ested in attracting the attention of venture cap i tal ists than in learning

the curriculum. One faculty member noted that entrepreneurial ambitions have produced an instrumentalism that has corroded the purpose of the IITs. Now, “instead of technology and engineering,” he said
in frustration, “all they want to understand is the business of business.” 72 He also highlighted the growing sense among students that
the classroom was no longer as valuable a space of training for the
future as the E- Cell and other extracurricular spaces. In a striking in-

stance of coming full circle, the laboratory had come to be valued
above the classroom, although now the laboratory was a space associ-

ated with the “immaterial labor” of information technology. Faculty at

U.S. universities also echoed this concern. Chatterjee, an IIT alumnus
and MIT professor, pointed to the decline in research motivation and
competence of his PhD students from the IITs. “The kids we get now,
they still stand out dramatically in the classroom,” he noted. “When
they take exams, they’re always the top in the class. But I don’t see as

many of them stand out in research.”

Interestingly, these sentiments were echoed by a Silicon Valley

IITian. Unlike his northern counter parts, who rejected the scaffolding

of the large com pany as a barrier to entrepreneurial ambitions, Vish-

wanath, a Tamil Brahmin 1972 IIT Madras alumnus, was a “lifer” in
IBM’s research division. He expressed deep frustration with what he
characterized as IITians’ wholesale shift away from research. “Every-

body thinks that either you should be an entrepreneur or you should

have armies of people working for you,” he groused. “When you give

them the business card, they look and see, oh, does the word ‘man ag er’

appear there or not. Oh, it doesn’t appear? Then you must be a loser.

Or they ask you questions like— how many people report to you? what’s

the bud get you control?—as if that proves that they are smarter than

you.” Vishwanath was not against branding per se; he just wanted the
IIT brand to stand for research skill. He had become a practiced thorn
in the side of highly vis i ble promoters of the IITs, whom he would ha-

rass to “talk about scientists and technologists who have done very
well in terms of their contributions to science, research, society, not
just create this kind of hero worshipping of only the people who mumble

stuff about innovation but have no credentials to back it.” His proselytizing didn’t stop with the newsmakers. “I am trying to change [73]

peoples’ attitudes,” Vishwanath told me. “And not just the technical
people. Also Appa, Amma, Thatha, Patti [ Father, Mother, Grand father,

Grand mother], all these people that are part of the ecosystem, who play

a signifcant role in shaping the thinking of kids.”

At the 2008 conference, Vishwanath was in one of the sessions on

research, where he gave a full- throated defense of academic and indus-

trial research as the best way to realize the purpose of the IITs as emblems of meritocracy. But his increasing frustration with the direction
of the IITs had also led him beyond the institutions. Vishwanath was
appointed as IBM’s India chief scientist from 2006 to 2009, during


-----

312 THE CASTE OF MERIT

which time he traveled to what he called “no- name colleges” to spread

his message about the excitement of research. “The idea,” he told me,
“was to brainwash these third- and fourth- tier undergraduate students

into believing that a research career is a good thing, get them excited,

not think the same old way that every body thinks so they make deci-

sions based on more than that one number: the salary.” To his surprise,
Vishwanath found these students far more receptive than IIT students,

who “ were all on the fast- track to money making.” While rewarding,

it was also evident that Vishwanath found it demoralizing to think of
how few of these students were likely to fnd the support needed to

pursue research careers.

Still other IIT Madras alumni offered a class critique of entrepre-

neurship. Madhavan, the “star teacher” from Chapter 5, called the lie
to the idea of entrepreneurship as a natu ral expression of being an

IITian. “Silicon Valley entrepreneurs come from more affluent families which allows them to take risks,” he countered. “Most of us who
came from middle class families would work hard to be toppers within

the IIT and then go to a safe, well- paying job in the U.S. so we could

send money home to our parents to buy their own home or get our
sisters married. We weren’t about to take a risk with our future and

our families’ future. This is the majority of IITans, not the Silicon

Madhavan’s pointed rejection of entrepreneurship as an institutional ethos and professional ambition spoke to differences within the ubiquitous claim to being Valley entrepreneurs.” [74] middle class. In contrast

to the claims to middle classness of Silicon Valley IITians, Madhavan

identifed entrepreneurial risk as itself an index of inherited capital.
While he highlighted the forms of inherited capital required to be a
Silicon Valley entrepreneur, others mapped the divergence between

homeland and diasporic attitudes onto the signifcance of the region
in shaping the cultures of the dif fer ent IIT campuses. Some alumni

pointedly opined that Mumbai’s business culture may well have permeated the space of IIT Bombay to a greater degree than at other campuses and shaped the worldviews of its alumni.

In such expressions of dissent, we hear tensions between dif fer ent

imaginaries of upper casteness. Particularly noteworthy is the stance
of some Tamil Brahmin alumni and faculty, who shared a distaste for
the blatant embrace of accumulation, which they felt was more aligned


-----

BRAND IIT 313

with a mercantile sensibility. Some spoke of this as a departure from
an older model of ascetic intellectualism, which was a trademark characteristic of IIT Madras. For them, the overt market orientation of
Silicon Valley loyalists was unftting for a meritocratic institution and
threatened to blur the boundary between IIT Madras and its sociocultural environs. As with concerns around the impact of “the coached”
on institutional culture, here, too, one hears anx i eties around the

“taint” of the market. Even as most also embrace the elevated standing
of their brand, they reject what they see as an openly instrumental approach to the IIT pedigree. Vishwanath, the IBM scientist, put it most
bluntly: “All these good Brahminical values that, at least in the minds

of some people in the south used to mean that you should be good in

academics and intellectual pursuits, that that should be the overriding
ambition and you shouldn’t be taken in by these material things, all

that has vanished.”

Vishwanath’s invocation of Brahminical values speaks volumes

about the continuing transformation of IITian understandings of
meritocracy. As with the differences between urban cosmopolitan
and rural upper- caste attitudes toward coaching, new tensions have

arisen between intellectual and entrepreneurial models of upper
casteness. Unlike “the coached,” however, both homeland and diasporic alumni have laid claim to divergent understandings of upper-
caste meritocracy. The model of upper casteness in which entrepreneurial wealth accumulation is elevated above all other pursuits and
IIT Bombay tops the pecking order of campuses has not gone over
well with all Madras IITians. To their surprise, those who were once

emblematic of upper- caste meritocracy now fnd themselves resisting

its most recent iteration.

�

In this chapter, we have tracked the decades- long sedimentation of the

upper- caste, diasporic IITian as an entrepreneurial subject against the

backdrop of a longer history of Indian migration. Indian diasporic life
in the United States has always been a pro cess of navigating the in-

heritances of caste with the pitfalls of racialization. The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act allowed for an infux of Indian professionals who became representative of what was in actuality a more

314 THE CASTE OF MERIT

diverse diaspora. IITians were among this representative group of pro-

fessionals. While they were less vis i ble in the early years, a confuence

of factors— the rise of information technology, the shift of many IITians

to this sector, and the Silicon Valley boom— allowed for a newly coor-

dinated effort to produce the image of the entrepreneurial Indian and
Brand IIT. The proj ect of forging and publicizing an entrepreneurial

model of the IITian shored up the possessive investment in upper casteness dramatically. As they emerged as a risk worth taking, IITians
have been catapulted into the ranks of the wealthy; the payoff of caste
has never been as apparent. At the same time, the elevation of entrepreneurialism and of IIT Bombay as the ideal types of upper- caste mer-

itocracy has generated new tensions. While some IITians oppose diasporic claims to meritocracy as expressions of First World superiority,
others, such as Tamil Brahmins, seek to revalorize a model of the IITian
as an intellectual and a nation- builder.

The rise of Narendra Modi has augured another shift in IITian proj-

ects of self- fashioning. In the United States, this has been seen most

clearly in IITians’ endorsement of the BJP’s neoliberal capitalism. More
recently, Modi’s style of authoritarian pop u lism has also garnered sup-

port in both the United States and India. In India, this is evident in an
escalation of cultural nationalist politics on IIT campuses. [75] It is to this
most recent expression of upper casteness within India, and its implications for the ongoing dialectic of upper- caste claims to merit and

lower- caste claims to rights, that we turn in the Conclusion.


-----

#### Conclusion

_The Caste of Merit_ has tracked the role of engineering education in
the transformation and consolidation of caste. As we have seen, the
advent of po liti cal democracy reconstituted the terms of caste stratif-

cation and distinction. In par tic u lar, the ideology of meritocracy al-

lowed upper castes new forms of maneuver through their remaking as
meritocratic subjects. At the same time, Tamilnadu set a pre ce dent for

transforming the interplay between ascription and achievement. By
throwing into relief the inheritances of caste, particularly in the spheres
of higher education and white- collar employment, Non- Brahminism

and Dravidianism forced upper castes into a reactive claim to merit
on the basis of caste culture. From the 1990s, this dialectic of lower-
caste claims to rights and upper- caste claims to merit expanded to na-

tional and even transnational scale. The scaling up of a reactive politics of meritocracy was catalyzed by the implementation of the 1990
and 2006 Other Backward Class (OBC) reservation quotas. Unlike the
more universalistic claims to merit in previous de cades, the threat

posed by the entry of OBCs— frst into central government jobs and

then into centrally funded higher educational institutions— led to a

sharp identitarian turn in upper- caste politics. This more explicit equa-

tion between caste and merit echoed the much earlier practice of

Tamil Brahmin self- marking. Now, however, the self- marking of the

meritorious indexed not discrete caste identities but a consolidated

315

316 THE CASTE OF MERIT

grouping of upper castes arrayed in opposition to lower castes. Diasporic mobility was an impor tant check on this oppositional dynamic.

In the United States, upper castes could claim a racialized version of
meritocracy in which caste served as a crucial basis of collective maneuver and capital accumulation even while it was discursively obscured. Unlike in India, where the expansion of lower- caste rights was

a partial challenge to the reproduction of caste privilege, the United
States allowed for the unfettered leveraging of upper casteness as a possessive investment, a pro cess aided by assumptions about the innate

technical capacities of Indians within the knowledge economy.

In the 2010s, this ongoing dialectic of upper- and lower- caste claim-

making was complicated by a new factor: the election of the Hindu

nationalist BJP’s Narendra Modi as prime minister in May 2014. Modi’s
election has allowed for a retrenchment of caste power in ways that
mirror trends in the diaspora and undercut the gains of lower- caste pol-

itics. As a result of his election, IIT Madras and other central government campuses became more open battlegrounds of caste confict. On
one side were OBC and Dalit groups, newly empowered by their en-

hanced numbers to challenge an upper- caste status quo. On several

campuses, lower- caste solidarity found expression in organ ization

building. At IIT Madras, OBC and Dalit students came together in 2014
to form the Ambedkar Periyar Study Circle (APSC). At the University
of Hyderabad, Dalit students had formed the Ambedkar Student Association (ASA) much earlier, in 1993, but it was reactivated in the new

po liti cal climate. As is evident in their invocation of Dalit icon B. R.

Ambedkar, both student groups were explic itly aligned with anticaste

politics and openly critical of the upper- caste culture of their cam-

puses. On the other side, a long- standing politics of upper- caste meri-

tocracy was yoked to a centrally orchestrated state proj ect of Hindu

nationalism. The Modi government committed itself to a systematic
campaign of undercutting institutional autonomy by throwing its
weight behind groups allied to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and

criminalizing student opposition. For their part, the administrators of
central government institutions used the ascent of Modi to discipline
a more diverse and politicized student body and reinforce the upper-
caste culture of their campuses.


-----

CONCLUSION 317

There is a pattern to this scapegoating that is vis i ble across central

government campuses. Following Modi’s election, IIT Madras’s APSC
or ga nized a range of events on po liti cal and social issues that were a

striking echo of earlier Non- Brahmin and Dravidian causes. Some

events responded to the Modi government’s policy directives to central government institutions to hold a mandatory cele bration of San-

skrit Week, establish separate dining halls for vegetarians and nonvegetarians, and adopt Sanskrit name boards for campus facilities. In
response, the APSC or ga nized a series of lectures. One was on the poli-

tics of language, in which the speaker challenged the notion of Sanskrit as the _Deva-_ _basha,_ or “ mother of all languages,” and illuminated

its use historically to marginalize lower castes. Another addressed the
history of bans on cow slaughter as part of the promotion of upper- caste

norms of vegetarianism. Other APSC events addressed the ongoing impact of economic liberalization. At one, organizers screened Charlie
Chaplin’s _Modern Times_ and discussed changing labor laws. At an-

other, they staged a debate on genet ically modifed organisms and the

plight of the Indian farmer.

In April 2015, the IIT Madras dean of students “de- recognized” the

APSC on the grounds that the group had violated protocol in event pro-

gramming. It was subsequently revealed that the dean had acted at
the behest of the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD),

which was itself responding to an anonymous letter from a group of
students accusing the APSC of “creating hatred among students in the
name of caste . . . and against the prime minister and Hindus.” The

standoff between the APSC and the college administration quickly spiraled out from the campus as the de- recognition sparked protests in

Chennai among Dravidianist, Dalit, and Left organ izations. Demon-

strations on other central government campuses followed, criticizing
the overreach of the college administration and the Modi government.
The issue became front- page news across media outlets and a touch-

stone for po liti cal opinion and mobilization, eventually leading to the

APSC’s reinstatement.

At the University of Hyderabad, events took a more tragic turn.

There were two ASA events in par tic u lar that brought the group into

a head-on collision with the BJP- affiliated student group the Akhil


-----

318 THE CASTE OF MERIT

Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and eventually with the Modi
government. The frst was a protest against the hanging of Yakub
Memon for his involvement in the 1993 Mumbai attack. The second
was the screening of the flm _Muzzafarnagar Baqi Hai,_ on the 2013
communal riots that paved the way for Modi’s victory in the 2014 general elections. In August 2015, BJP labor minister Bandaru Dattatreya

wrote to the MHRD, charging the ASA of “casteist, extremist, and anti-
national politics” and with assaulting the ABVP president. Yielding to
pressure from the MHRD, the university chancellor denied fve Dalit
members of the ASA entry into the dorms, cafeterias, and other social
spaces on campus, and disqualifed them from participating in student
union elections. After experiencing twelve days of an administratively

orchestrated social boycott that reeked of caste ostracism, one of the
fve, a student named Rohith Vemula, committed suicide. Vemula’s
death sparked outrage and led to a spreading politics of dissent across
IIT campuses, seen in the mushrooming of groups allied with the
APSC. Some, like IIT Delhi’s APSC, kept the same name. Others, like

IIT Bombay’s Ambedkar Periyar Phule Study Circle, expressed their
pan- IIT solidarity while indexing their own regional history of anti-

caste protest. [1]

A third confrontation occurred at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru

University (JNU) in early 2016. On February 9, 2016, the Demo cratic

Students Union held a protest against the killings of Kashmiri separatist Maqbool Bhat and Afzal Guru, who was charged and convicted
for the 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament. The university administration had withdrawn permission for the event shortly before it was
due to begin because of protests by members of the ABVP. Four days

after the event, Kanhaiya Kumar— the JNU student union president—

was arrested by the Delhi police and charged with sedition. Two other
student arrests followed. In response to the arrests, the campus came
to a standstill, with thousands of students, faculty, and staff joining
ongoing protests. The arrests also elicited criticism of the Modi government’s heavy- handed approach to po liti cal dissent from across

the country and from a large number of international scholars. Although investigations into the incident turned up nothing and led to
all the arrested students being granted bail, an internal inquiry
charged the students with procedural violations, and a range of sanc-

CONCLUSION 319

tions were imposed on twenty- one students. In response, the students

went on an indefnite hunger strike, and the Delhi High Court suspended the sanctions on the condition that the students end their
strike. [2]

These confrontations highlight the conscription of central govern-

ment campuses as one front in a war waged by the Modi government
against those it deems enemies of the nation. To advance a Hindu na-

tionalist vision of culture, history, and citizenship, and consolidate
support for his regime, Modi has relied on the construction of an ever-
expanding category of “anti- nationals.” Cultural theorist Stuart Hall

used the term “authoritarian pop u lism” to point to a similar po liti cal

strategy used during Margaret Thatcher’s tenure in Britain. Thatcherism, he argued, shifted British demo cratic politics toward authoritari- [3]

anism by using a series of “moral panics” around race, law and order,
and social liberalism to produce a populist groundswell of support for
the increasing centralization of power. Similarly, the Modi government’s targeting of “anti- nationals” within central government insti- [4]

tutions is part of a larger politics of authoritarian consolidation in the
name of “the people” that includes violent attacks on Muslims and

Dalits under the guise of cow protection, the policing of interreligious

love and women’s sexuality, the arrests of civil and human rights ac-

tivists, and the killing of journalists. [5]

Under Modi, fomenting vio lence against “anti- nationals” has also

been accompanied by the reversal of a rights agenda. A number of
scholars have noted the paradoxical coupling in the 2000s of a neoliberal economic agenda promoting market- oriented accumulation strat-

egies with social policy interventions aimed at protecting subaltern
groups threatened by dispossession. [6] This was especially the case under

the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) co ali tion government

led by the Congress Party, which oversaw new rights- based legislation,

including the Right to Information Act of 2005, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and the Forest Rights Act of 2006, the Right
to Education Act of 2009, and the Right to Food Act and the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act of 2013. The implementation of Mandal II— the 2006 OBC quotas— was part of this wave

of legislation. Each of these laws was a response to social movement

mobilization during the 1990s against economic liberalization. [7] Through


-----

320 THE CASTE OF MERIT

these new laws, the UPA government sought to secure popu lar legiti-

macy through an agenda of “inclusive neoliberalism” while furthering
predatory growth that opened up manufacturing, mining, retail, and
banking to private interests. [8]

With the election of Modi as the head of the co ali tion National

Demo cratic Alliance government, this strategy of subaltern legal rec-

ognition was supplanted by a model of the “strongman savior.” This
model, which elevated Modi himself as the answer to social ills, was
promoted and received differently by vari ous and often polarized con-

stituencies. For lower castes and the poor, Modi’s own life story as a
tea vendor who rose up the ranks to po liti cal stardom, his diatribes

against elites, and his promises to fght corruption and to bring _acche_
_din_ (good days) to all Indians were peddled as the antidote to the wid-

ening disparities of the 2000s. [9] For upper castes and the wealthy, it was
a dif fer ent story. As we saw in Chapter 7, despite the Congress Party’s

promotion of economic liberalization, Silicon Valley IITians heralded
Modi as the leader who would unshackle growth. For them and other
Indian elites, the rights- based legislation under the UPA was nothing

more than “vote bank politics,” which was bad for business. Their support for Modi rested on the expectation that he would curb the welfare and social expenditures of the 2000s and extend to the national
level policies he had championed as chief minister of Gujarat, such as
the courting of foreign investment, a rollback of state regulations, and
a weakening of or ga nized labor. [10] And, indeed, under Modi, inequali-

ties in wealth and income escalated to the point where, by 2017, the
richest 1 percent of the Indian population owned 73 percent of the

country’s wealth and controlled 21.7 percent of national income. [11] Not

only did in equality increase, the turn away from a rights- based ap-

proach toward the leveraging of moral panics undercut lower- caste

claims and secured the position of upper castes in the most lucrative
private sectors of the Indian economy.

As with the spectral targets of moral panics, the ferocity of the

backlash against reservation thus obscures how favorable the conditions actually are for the upper- caste accumulation of wealth. What,

then, explains the shrill defense of meritocracy and ominous predictions about the end of liberal democracy that are directed at lower- caste

po liti cal mobilization? The “elite revolt” against reservation, and sub-

CONCLUSION 321

altern rights more broadly, suggests a remarkably power ful and resil-

ient sense of entitlement, where any mea sure of distributive justice is

perceived as a threat to the natu ral order of things. [12] In the successive

fault lines between the mental and the manual, the gifted and the

coached, the general and the reserved, diaspora and homeland, and authoritarian pop u lism and lower- caste rights politics, we see the dy-

namic and sustained forms of maneuver through which the possessive
investment in upper casteness is expressed and secured.

It is not only in India that IITians and other Indian professionals

have come out in support of authoritarian pop u lism. Some in the U.S.

diaspora have as well. Once again, the linchpin has been merit. On February 3, 2018, members of the Republican Hindu Co ali tion marched

to the White House in support of U.S. president Donald Trump’s proposal to implement a “merit- based” immigration system favoring

skilled workers and ending both chain migration for family members

and the diversity lottery. Shouting slogans such as “Indians love
Trump,” “Clear Green Card Backlog,” and “Trump bringing Ram Rajya”
(the just rule of the Hindu god- king Ram), group members endorsed both

Trump’s immigration proposal and his call for a wall on the southern
border with Mexico to keep out “illegals.” The contrast between legal

and illegal mi grants was underscored in another chant: “No DACA

without DALCA.” In a play on DACA— the acronym for the Deferred

Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which benefts approximately
690,000 “Dreamers,” children brought illegally into the country— the

demonstrators referred to their own children as “DALCA,” with the

“L” standing for “ legal.” The Republican Hindu Co ali tion has demanded

that the children of high- skilled workers awaiting green cards be

granted legal permanent residency immediately, while those in the

DACA program be forced to pay a $25,000 fne to stay. [13] Here, again,

we see efforts to secure upper- caste capital through recourse to forms

of self- racialization aimed at distinguishing the meritocratic Indian

from other “prob lem minorities.” [14]

What are the implications of these pro cesses for Indian democracy?

In seeking to secure the conditions for capital accumulation, upper
castes have both leveraged notions of ascriptive merit and aligned
themselves with Modi’s brand of authoritarian pop u lism. Through this

combination of strategies, they have attempted to curtail lower- caste

challenges to the stark inequalities of Indian society that have been
further exacerbated by neoliberal economic restructuring. Their hope
is that the pincer effect of the market on one side and the strongman
savior on the other will choke off the possibilities for a genuinely

popu lar democracy.

Even as elites evacuate public arenas and make explic itly identi-

tarian claims to private spheres of accumulation, it is subalterns who
increasingly express commitments to the common good and call on
the state to advance universal equality, well- being, and rights. This,

in part, explains the overriding focus of lower- caste politics on reser-

vation as a vehicle of rights. We have seen how critical quotas have
been to increasing lower- caste repre sen ta tion in public arenas of higher

education and professional employment. At the same time, they fall
short of more far- reaching mea sures of distributive justice. It is telling

that regions such as Tamilnadu, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh, which have
witnessed state capture by OBCs and Dalits and the expansion of reservation, have yet to experience signifcant challenges to the unequal
distribution of wealth. [15] Rather, expanded caste repre sen ta tion, espe-

cially in government employment, has existed alongside enduring socioeconomic in equality and the per sis tence of vigilante vio lence

against Dalits who experience some mea sure of social mobility. [16] Caste

is still very much the basis for the reproduction of inherited privileges
and disadvantages. Furthermore, a caste politics focused solely on reservation obscures the place of public education within a larger po liti cal

economy of rising in equality. At a time when India’s top 10 percent

commands a greater share of national income than in the United States,
Canada, Rus sia, China, and Eu rope, only a small fraction of the popu-

lation can even claim the opportunities afforded by higher education
or white- collar employment. [17] In this sense, Tamilnadu is a sobering

reminder of the limits of a politics aimed at expanding caste repre sen-

ta tion within the middle class that is not accompanied by efforts to

address the structural reproduction of poverty. The lower- caste ambi-

tion to enter the professions has kept in place the hierarchies of labor

that underpin the graded inequalities of caste.

Recent trends in lower- caste mobilization, however, point toward

a more egalitarian politics. From the claims of Tamilnadu’s farmers to
higher support prices and loan waivers to Dalit land claims in Gujarat,

CONCLUSION 323

new forms of po liti cal ferment augur more effective challenges to struc-

tural in equality. It is also promising that student mobilizations on

elite campuses against upper- caste meritocracy have made common

cause with such strug gles among the rural and urban poor. [18] These

emergent forms of solidarity, which cut across class and sectoral boundaries, could be the most effective challenge yet to the possessive investment in upper casteness.

By contrast to these movements against the inheritances of caste,

meritocracy rings hollow as a corrective to older hierarchies of status.
As we have seen throughout this book, by bracketing out historically
accumulated advantages and disadvantages, the notion of meritocracy,
like that of a color- blind society, has come to ser vice the reproduction

of in equality. Although meritocracy as a princi ple continues to animate

calls for equalization, the divergence between its ideal meaning and
its social life should call into question the assumption that meritocracy is indeed a leveler of opportunity.

5. There are obvious parallels to the arguments for meritocracy in the United
States. As with caste in India, the arguments for meritocracy in the United
States usually rest on critiques of affirmative action as a mechanism for
perpetuating racism and posit a postracial society where individual talent

have expanded steadily, such critiques have made their mark in the United
States, as seen in the rolling back of affirmative action and the recourse to
diversity as the only permissible language for addressing unequal represen ta tion. For critiques of the culturalist framing of caste that argue for

the salience of comparing caste and race, see Gerald Berreman, “Race,

on par with the untouchable castes of the region, the Shanars experienced
a dramatic shift in economic and social standing as a result of agricultural
modernization and religious conversion. Not only did they change their
caste name from Shanar to Nadar to symbolize their new status, but they
also began to claim a past of noble birth and an occupation as merchants
who had been reduced to bonded labor through a twist of fate.

and educational backwardness. These were grouped under three broad

headings— “Social,” “Educational,” and “Economic”:

A. Social:

(i) Castes / Classes considered as socially backward by others.

(ii) Castes / Classes which mainly depend on manual labor for their

livelihood.

(iii) Castes / Classes where at least 25 percent females and 10 percent

males above the state average get married at an age below 17 years
in rural areas and at least 10 percent females and 5 percent males do

so in urban areas.

(iv) Castes / Classes where participation of females in work is at least

25 percent above the State average.

B. Educational:

(v) Castes / Classes where the number of children in the age group of

5–15 years who never attended school is at least 25 percent above

the State average.

(vi) Castes / Classes where the rate of student drop- out in the age group

of 5–15 years is at least 25 percent above the State average.

(vii) Castes / Classes amongst whom the proportion of matriculates is at

least 25 percent below the State average.

C. Economic:

(viii) Castes / Classes where the average value of family assets is at least

25 percent below the State average.

(ix) Castes / Classes where the number of families living in Kuccha

houses is at least 25 percent above the State average.

(x) Castes / Classes where the source of drinking water is beyond half a

kilo meter for more than 50 percent of the house holds.

60. The social composition of the “general category” is also a hotly debated issue.

It is unclear whether OBC and SC / ST applicants who qualify for admission

through the “general category” are now relegated to the quota simply because

they are eligible. If this is indeed the case, it makes the “general category” a
de facto quota for upper castes against the Indra Sawhney ruling.

###### Acknowl edgments

Arguments about innate intelligence are certainly not unique to
India. The world over, we fnd the impulse to naturalize intellectual
ability and locate it in certain bodies and not others. In India, as else-

where, assumptions about academic success and failure acquire the
weight of common sense, difficult to budge and reinforced over time
and by habit. It is striking how easily we obscure material worlds of
opportunity and disadvantage from view, in the pro cess transforming

prejudice into discernment, exclusion into selectivity, and history into
nature. At elite institutions like Harvard, the drive to identify the exceptional student, to fnd the diamond in the rough, and to deploy the
language of ranking are ubiquitous practices. We trade in the currency
of brilliance and exceptionalism, honing our diagnostic powers to a
fne art. Most of us are aware that our students come from wildly varied
circumstances, yet we continue to judge them using utterly decontextualized mea sures of merit. When we are pushed, we acknowledge

that institutional stratifcation and its associated hierarchies of value
are better explained by uneven resources than by the concentration
of brainpower. And yet institutional rationales make it almost impossible to act on that knowledge. To keep in view the structural shaping
of educational trajectories, to fully acknowledge that our intellectual
endowments are gifts of society and not nature, to recognize a glowing
résumé as an accident of history, would undercut the very notion of
excellence. Instead, we herald the test score, the institutional brand,

the prize- winning academic monograph as markers of distinction, in-

tellectual worth, and market value that tell a story of individual
achievement and intrinsic merit.

This book expresses my disquiet in the face of such impulses to

naturalize merit by writing out histories of privilege. My own professional trajectory is a case in point. As the benefciary of state, caste,
and family, I can hardly chalk up my academic successes to mere talent.

The same is true of this book. As the product of innumerable conversations and acts of generosity both within and outside the acad emy, and

of the conceptual paths hewn by other scholars of caste, race, and democracy, it would be absurd to claim this monograph as individual intellectual property. I have many, many people to thank for making

this book a real ity. It gestated for far too long and accrued many debts

along the way. In part, it was difficult to bring to a close because the

battle over meritocracy is a live issue in India and the United States.
The steady stream of news about caste and racial discrimination, and
legal challenges to affirmative action, make the subject of this book
an ongoing story. Happily, over the long course of this book’s development, I have met a growing number of colleagues working on merit
and caste in India and on the intersections of race and caste. It has been
my privilege to exchange ideas with them about the everyday vio lence

of caste in India and about the resonances and connections between
histories of caste and race.

The research and writing for this book were supported by the Na-

tional Humanities Center, Harvard’s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, and the Harvard Asia Center. The de cade of work re-

sulted in articles along the way. The Introduction and Chapters 1, 3, 5,
and 7 build on ideas frst discussed in “Making Merit: The Indian Institutes of Technology and the Social Life of Caste,” _Comparative_
_Studies in Society and History_ 57, no. 2 (2015): 291–322. Chapter 6
builds on ideas frst discussed in “Meritocracy and Democracy: Indian
Reservations and the Politics of Caste,” in “Interrogating ‘Diversity,’ ”

special issue, _Public Culture_ (2019).

The historical research for this book was done in the Tamil Nadu

Archives. I thank the archive staff for their help in locating the necessary documents. The ethnographic work depended on the generosity
of the many faculty, students, and alumni of the IITs. Two directors of

IIT Madras, M. S. Ananth and Bhaskar Ramamurthy, granted me interviews and access to the institution’s archives and facilities. The
Alumni Office, the Placement Office, and a number of other faculty
and administrators engaged my questions in interviews and more informally. The Alumni Office also let me attend all the sessions of the
2008 Pan- IIT alumni conference. Most of all, I am grateful to the many

alumni and students who granted me interviews that often required
more than one session. This book would not have been pos si ble without

their patience in the face of my endless questions.

Thanks to invitations from colleagues, I have benefted from sharing

this research at a number of dif fer ent venues, including the Affirma-

tive Action conference hosted by the South Asia Research and Information Institute at Southern Methodist University; the American
Institute of Indian Studies’ fftieth- year conference in New Delhi;

Brandeis University’s Center for Global Development and Sustainability; Brown University’s Center for Con temporary South Asia;

Columbia University’s South Asia Center; the Democracy and Its
Trajectories conference at the University of Bergen, Norway; Harvard’s

writing group partners— Vincent Brown, Glenda Carpio, and Rachel

St. John— for being the perfect comrades- in- arms through the writing

of the second book. Another group that I could not have done without
is the Po liti cal Anthropology Working Group at Harvard, which has

been a cornerstone of my Harvard experience. Our biweekly discussions of works in pro gress have been some of the most generous and

stimulating instances of intellectual exchange I have ever encountered.
As I was wrapping up the book in fall 2018, I taught an undergraduate
seminar on race and caste. The students in that class and the teaching
fellow, Amulya Mandava, were a real inspiration. They pushed me to

work through the thickets of jargon that are a staple of academic argumentation and convey in clearer terms the signifcance of understanding social stratifcation in place and across time. I thank them
for their commitment to a difficult course and for challenging me
in turn.

This book straddled two stints at Harvard, the frst before tenure

and the second after. Over this stretch of time, Harvard Anthropology

went through many changes. The departure of three dear friends, Asad
Ahmed, Engseng Ho, and Smita Lahiri, makes me wistful for the department that could have been. It has also been devastating to lose
Mary Steedly, who was my most trusted se nior mentor. Despite these

losses, my strengthening relationships with newer and older colleagues,
the everyday support of our fantastic staff, and my incredible students
have made the department an intellectual and professional home for

me. Harvard can certainly be frustrating and alienating, which makes
one cherish the niches of friendship and belonging that much more.

It was a plea sure to work with Sharmila Sen, Heather Hughes, and

Stephanie Vyce at Harvard University Press. I am grateful to my editor, Sharmila, for her honesty and wise counsel. Pitching the book to
her was an uncanny experience because of how intuitively she under-

stood its arguments. It made the decision to go with Harvard remarkably easy.

It is difficult to know how to properly thank family. My in- laws,

Manuelita and Willie Brown, have been wonderfully supportive and
generous with their warm and welcoming California home. My husband, Vincent Brown, has been such a seamless part of my life that it
is hard to even step back enough to write this. We are coming up on a
quarter century together of school, travel, jobs, kids, and all the rest in

between. He has been my intellectual sounding board, co- teacher,

co- parent, fellow hater of the New England cold, and fellow dreamer

of other worlds. I am so lucky to have a daily companion who both challenges and grounds me. Over the past de cade of research and writing,

our daughters, Zareen and Anisa, have grown into curious, funny, pas-

sionate girls, who ask difficult questions and don’t accept easy answers.

Their ferce sense of justice in the face of unfairness and inhumanity
gives me great hope that the world they make will be far saner and

more equitable than the one we bequeath them.

I dedicate this book to my parents, V. Vasanthi Devi and K. S. Sub-

ramanian. Throughout my life, they have offered me unconditional
support. Now with children of my own, I marvel at their unwavering

faith in my judgment, even when I embarked on adventures that were

so far from their own experiences. I hope that as my daughters grow, I

too will have the faith and trust to know when to let them go. My par-

ents were also instrumental in the making of this book. The year

spent in Chennai for research and all the shorter stints since would
have been impossible without them. They helped with every thing from

apartment and school hunting to taking care of our daughters. My

mother, a historian by training who spent most of her life as a university administrator and an activist for education reform, introduced me
to invaluable contacts for my research and kept me informed about the
inequities of Indian education. My father, an Indian civil servant who

became an international development practitioner before retiring and
taking on a third career as a translator, read the whole manuscript with

his discerning eye and offered critical suggestions. I have lived oceans
away for most of my adult life, but they have always been there when

I needed them. This book is a tribute to their support and care.
