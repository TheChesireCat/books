# Books

Here, you’ll find books I’m interested in, currently reading, or simply hoarding. This might evolve into a second brain or a note-taking system someday—who knows? It all depends on how much free time I can carve out. Initially, this setup was just a way to have the Chrome web reader narrate books to me while I worked.


## List of Books

- **Harvest and Sowing v0** – Translated by Tongchow  
- **Mathematica** – David Bessis  
- **Récoltes et Semailles v1** – From Slaoui's UTexas account  
- **The Caste of Merit** – Ajanta Subramanian  

## Features

- **Dynamic Book Browsing**: Explore a collection of Markdown files dynamically loaded from the `/mds` directory.  
- **Accessibility-Friendly Markdown Rendering**: I use `md-block`, which doesn’t create a `shadow-root` like alternatives such as `zero-md`. This allows me to style the markdown with Tailwind CSS while keeping it fully accessible to screen readers. Highly recommend! (Check it out: [md-block](https://md-block.verou.me/))  
- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Makes customizing the layout and appearance a breeze.
