#### Introduction

 A Brief History of Hinduism

In the summer of 1902, when the maharajah of Jaipur set sail to attend the
coronation of King Edward VII in London, parked in his steamer was a
team of Indian cows. The cow, venerated by orthodox Hindus, had for
generations now enjoyed a place of eminence in the overseas retinues of
high-born ‘natives’. In 1831, Raja Ram Mohun Roy, the celebrated Bengali
thinker and spokesperson of the Mughal emperor, landed in England with a
cow. [1] Just under two decades later, Rana Jung Bahadur of Nepal also
travelled West with cattle, allowing Indian attendants alone to milk them,
lest they lose their sacred quality. [2] The Gaekwad of Baroda got on a ship to
Europe in 1887 with two cows, though in this case, the adventure sadly
proved taxing for the animals—they died before the vessel docked in Aden.
3 Such tragedy notwithstanding, the cow did preserve its status in the
international rosters of itinerant Hindu princes. It served, after all, not only
as a source of ritually pure milk on foreign shores but also as a breathing
totem of custom and faith for men wedged between traditional religiosity
and colonial modernity.

It was a conundrum Madho Singh II of Jaipur (1862–1922) felt keenly

when he accepted his invitation to the coronation. He was an old-fashioned
man, who only recently had censured a courtier for crossing the ‘black
waters’ of the ocean and going abroad—an undertaking prohibited to good
Hindus. [4] And now he was himself called upon to travel to London and pay
homage in person to his English suzerain. Naturally, the maharajah turned
to his priests for advice—the issue was not _if_ he could go as much as _how_
he might do so without causing violence to the sensibilities of his people
and the religious sanctity of his position. The Brahmins did not take long to
give the ruler their counsel: It was decided that if the maharajah went with


-----

his family deity, Sri Gopalji, he could bypass the injunction against
international travel. [5] For that way, technically, it would be the sanctified
image that went to England, and as a good devotee, Madho Singh would
only be ‘following’ Sri Gopalji from his Jaipur shrine to the headquarters of
the empire. Where mortals could not directly flout custom, god would show
the way.

What followed was elaborate preparations for Sri Gopalji and his

princely escort, joined by 125 less exalted others, to sail. The SS _Olympia_ , a
sparkling new (and thus, undefiled) steamer, was acquired and customized
for Jaipur’s purposes. Two dozen Brahmins travelled to Bombay in advance
to ‘purify’ the ship, and six months’ worth of water from the Ganga, India’s
most sacred river, was transported in silver urns—that way, the maharajah
was spared the abhorrent prospect of swallowing English water. [6] Baggage
weighed at 2000 _maund_ s (about 70 tons) was heaped into eight wagons of a
train; this being done, Madho Singh himself set out from Jaipur. In Bombay,
a second round of rituals followed to venerate the sea-god, copying,
reportedly, the precise protocol established by Rama, the hero of the epic
Ramayana, in some imprecise mythical time. This involved dropping gold
and silver onto the waves, not to speak of ‘raw rice, cocoanuts, flowers and
milk’. [7] Having thus traced ‘the footsteps of his ancestor’, the ruler, who
claimed descent from both Rama and the sun, finally went forth to the land
of his white masters, in the all-validating shadow of god. [8]

Arriving in London after a series of memorable incidents—such as in

Marseilles where Madho Singh distributed mangoes to a French crowd—
this marriage between expediencies of the age and stage-managed custom
resumed. When the maharajah started from Victoria station, it was Sri
Gopalji’s image that occupied the first carriage, Madho Singh following
behind—a sight that caused, according to a chronicler, public amazement. [9]

Newspapers, the account stresses, praised the maharajah’s devotion to his
deity, and the reader is constantly reminded of how he upheld every Indian
habit and tradition in his daily routine. [10] Madho Singh did, of course, go to
the opera, the races, to the Crystal Palace, Madam Tussaud’s and other still-


-----

popular tourist spots in the capital of _Inglistan_ , but all with Sri Gopalji’s
blessings. Indeed, when the coronation was postponed after Edward VII
became unexpectedly ill, the maharajah ‘appealed day and night’ to his
Hindu deity, who magnanimously intervened, we read, and restored the
Christian king to strength. [11] If the crowning took place at all, that is, it was
because an Indian god, with his royal camp follower, happened to be in
London to save the day.

By September, the maharajah was home, presumably with his cows in

reasonable good health. Madho Singh had proved his loyalty to the Raj not
only by attending the coronation in person but also, it was said, by calling at
Buckingham Palace every day during Edward VII’s illness. [12] The story
goes that while other visitors used the time to holiday in Scotland and Paris,
the ruler of Jaipur refused to leave London till the British _padshah_
(emperor) recovered. He also ensured there was little criticism at home for
breaching custom—Brahmin pandits, a Muslim aide and men of the
commercial classes had accompanied him, creating a stake (or culpability at
any rate) in the escapade for multiple interests. [13] Or as an English daily
explained, this ‘true Oriental’ who identified with ‘all the ancient religious
traditions’ that were ‘so unspeakably dear to the souls of the Hindus’, had

14
nevertheless proved ‘absolutely faithful to his duty as a vassal of the KingEmperor’. For Madho Singh occupied two very different worlds, and
with the services of sympathetic priests and a mobile deity, maintained a
fine balance between both.

One of the brightest gifts of the Indian priest is the ability to bypass
awkward corners between theory and reality through the manipulation of
tradition. For centuries, kings were consumers of this marvellous Brahmin
talent. Nearly each time a peasant chief or warrior achieved a degree of
power, for instance, it was the Brahmin he turned to, seeking legitimization
through an upgrade in caste and ritual status. Cows were, as always, critical:


-----

One ceremony required the aspirant to wait inside an artificial gold bovine
while his priests chanted mantras. And at the appropriate moment, the man
would spring from the womb of his new ‘mother’, reborn into the superior
rank he sought. In a 1659 episode, a freshly minted monarch of Tanjore
reportedly even sat in the lap of the priest’s wife, bawling like a baby, lest
there be confusion about the proceedings. [15] Either way, for the Brahmin
ritualist, this reaffirmed his unique right to bestow status; for the would-be
king, meanwhile, it was elevation from an ordinary provenance into a
league of semi-divine proportions. [16] And once both sides had got what they
wanted, the cow was dismantled, the priests taking home (most of) its
pieces. [17]

But droll as this sounds, it marks also a more serious dynamic. India is a

civilization raised up on astute compromises. It could be no other way,
given the linguistic, ethnic, geographical and cultural diversity of the land.
Keepers of the song and lore which shaped its national narrative confronted
such dizzying contingencies that a degree of plasticity was integral to
holding it all together. [18] After all, in the 3000 years preceding Madho
Singh’s journey to Europe, the country had witnessed wave after wave of
change. Vedic culture, with its fire altars and sacrifices, promoted by Indo–
Aryans, met competition from cults that venerated gods in images; this
encounter caused Hindu practice to emerge by the end of the first
millennium CE as a grand system of temple worship. [19] Buddhism and
Jainism sponged away patronage, and though they faded, these too marked
the landscape with hybridity. Then came Islam from overseas: It could
neither be defied, given its proximity to power, nor absorbed into one of
India’s capacious traditions—here a more uncertain adaptation appeared.
Finally came the trauma of colonialism, backed by withering evangelical
Christian attacks—the theme of this book—birthing yet another face for
Hinduism. All throughout, Brahmin texts lamented this _kali yuga_ —a black
age of corruption and doom—when the undeserving sat on thrones and
‘order’ (as they defined it) took a leave of absence. [20] But formal cries


-----

aside, they adjusted each time, maintaining a façade of continuity while
actively innovating, blending old with new.

This, in fact, is patent from the beginning. In ancient times, as Indo–

Aryan culture fanned out from the Indus Valley in the subcontinent’s northwest, to the eastward Gangetic heartland of India, it stumbled onto groups
with varied social beliefs. [21] For Brahmin promoters of the Vedic religion,
these were originally _mleccha_ s, or barbarians, regardless of whether they
were advanced urban people or tribes deep in the forest. Why, even eaters
of garlic—taboo for many Brahmins even now—were mlecchas. [22] Most of
present-day India, tellingly, was branded mleccha _-desa_ , or barbarian
country, including Gujarat and Sindh in the west, Bengal and Bihar in the
east, and the southern peninsula; to visit these places was to commit ‘sin
through the feet’. [23] But, in practice, with the rise of new kingdoms,
opening up of commercial links, migrations sparked by intra-Aryan
conflicts, and that plain old human attraction to fresh avenues, Brahmins _did_
set foot in such territories. The idea of the mleccha-desa remained, but
mutated quietly from a geographical definition to the more versatile concept
of a place where the Brahminical order was not in vogue. [24] And naturally,
it fell upon Brahmins to propagate their system wherever they went,
transforming assorted mleccha-desas into lands receptive to them and their
four holy texts, the Vedas. [25] Or as the father of Hindu nationalism would
later put it, there began a ‘process of assimilation, elimination, and
consolidation’, outlining what we today call Hinduism. [26]

Necessarily, however, this was only possible through a give and take of

principles and positions. The orthodox tradition of Brahmin elites
envisioned a world of four caste groups, functioning in carefully policed
harmony. At the top sat, of course, Brahmins themselves, guarding the gates
of divine access. Then came Kshatriyas, or a ruling class, whose duty was
to protect Brahmins and the world they had designed. The Vaishyas were
the productive classes, followed by a fourth set in the Sudras, or a general
mass, to serve everybody else. In actual fact, though, this division never
existed in such perfection in most of India. [27] It was an aspiration—the


-----

portrayal of an ideal Brahmin world—rather than reality as it existed.
Tradition wrote off troublesome details of this type as a defect of the kali
yuga. Better epochs did, it was claimed, exist, but these had (conveniently)
passed in the time of mythical heroes and legendary kings. Now, there were
only Brahmins and problems, and a fight to ‘restore’ the correct way of
things—a stance that not only justified the selling of Brahminical ideas in
virgin territories with all the gloss of a sacred mission but also,
simultaneously, relieved Brahmins from the pressures of rigidity, allowing
sensible bargains. For their vision of the world was mostly theoretical, its
practical enactment proving messier than official narratives allow.
Hinduism, as it would emerge, was not so much what Brahmins wanted;
instead, it is the story of their _negotiations_ with a bewildering variety of
counter-thoughts and alternate visions. Change is coded into its DNA.

Of course, Brahminical ideas held leverage too, and as monarchies

emerged in India, dynasts found this creed attractive. [28] Its theories on
social stratification, the portal various rites opened to the gods and its means
to supply legitimacy established a reciprocal (if also tense) bond between
power and religion. [29] Or as a key text offers: ‘The Kshatriya does not
flourish without the Brahmin, and the Brahmin does not prosper without the
Kshatriya’—hence such rituals as of the golden cow to invent Kshatriyas
where there were none. [30] Unsurprisingly, Brahmins frowned upon areas
following non-monarchical systems and were, therefore, disinterested in
their ideology. [31] Moreover, contenders appeared in the form of Buddhism
and Jainism, growing popular with those segments excluded from the
accord between Brahmins and royalty. Focused not on pleasing gods as
much as ethical living, these Sramanic (‘striving’) schools elevated nonviolence, good conduct and the purity of the soul—simpler narratives
capable of appealing to broader interests. [32] Once institutionalized,
Sramanic traditions competed fiercely with Brahmins—one Buddhist text
ranks dogs above Brahmins [33] —and Megasthenes counted both among the
class of ‘philosophers’ he encountered in India. Indeed, the third century


-----

bce edicts of the emperor Ashoka, personally a Buddhist, admit these
tensions and, wisely, advocate tolerance. [34]

The rise of the Mauryan empire in India in this period, and the access it

provided to unexplored pastures meant, additionally, that the field was open
for missionaries. [35] Buddhism, for example, spread out not only westwards
and south, but also overseas, its growth causing lasting anxieties to
Brahmins. The empire itself emerged from an erstwhile mleccha-desa,
absorbing ‘purer’ Aryan territories as it grew; thus, before reconciliation
was reached, an early emperor, branded a lowly Sudra, was recorded as a
slayer of (legitimate) Kshatriyas. [36] The advent of Greeks, Indo-Scythians
and other foreign tribes in the north-west meant that unforeseen political
and cultural ideas were also entering the fray from a different direction,
adding to the competitiveness of the religious market. In the circumstances,
Brahmins had again to adapt—they could either fade into irrelevance,
blaming mlecchas for their decline, or co-opt those aliens, arriving at
nimble compromises. [37] Already, as their Indo–Aryan ancestors abandoned
nomadic ways for settled agrarian life in the Gangetic belt, their religion
had changed: Its emphasis slid from the ritual act to philosophical
reflections collected in the later Vedic corpus, the Upanishads—which, in
turn, may have been catalysed by exchanges with other indigenous groups.
38 Anchors were still maintained in the Vedas but much perched outside was
also accepted. One method enabling this was hierarchy: All ideas were
welcome, but those closest to the Brahmins’ own were deemed higher or
superior, and those more grating, lower. [39] This was tolerance but within
certain parameters.

Either way, as Christianity dawned in the Middle East, in India too

religion was transformed. Old gods of the Vedic age, such as Indra and
Agni, made way for two powerful deities, Vishnu and Siva, with their own
mythologies and strategies to counter Sramanic ambitions. [40] Siva, for one,
is believed to represent the combination of a pre-Vedic Indic divinity with a
Vedic god, [41] while Vishnu went from a ‘one-act’ figure in the Vedas to a
‘god of colossal proportions’. [42] In many ways, it was a case of mix and
match: Non-Vedic gods could be merged with Vedic counterparts, and
Brahmins accepted popular elements from the other side, while cladding it


-----

in their theological principles. Ideas were transmitted through hugely
appealing epic poetry, which held clues as to such adaptation. The
Mahabharata, for instance, sells the (Brahmin-approved) concept of
monarchy over other systems, [43] but the polyandrous marriage of its five
heroes to a single wife suggests un-Aryan influences too. [44] Into the first
millennium CE , then, what we frame within the blanket term ‘Hinduism’ had
shed most of its Vedic appearance, becoming a more mixed commodity
known as the Puranic religion. [45] Originally shaped by bards through oral
traditions, this was codified by Brahmins into a Sanskrit corpus—the
Puranas—varnished with their own philosophical preoccupations. [46] And
their dissemination far and wide, where they assimilated diverse traditions
and wove these into a shared religious frame, coincided with the next great
imperial phase in India.

Under the Gupta dynasty—possibly of Brahmin descent [47] —by the fifth

century, Brahminical culture entrenched itself in faraway corners of the
land, carrying pet precepts while seeking to reconcile these with a
landscape of mindboggling diversity. [48] On the one hand, the Puranas reveal
a rivalry between adherents of the two big gods—where the _Sivapurana_
exalts Siva and presents Vishnu as awestruck, the _Vishnupurana_ pays back
in kind, showing its own protagonist as the superior. [49] But that aside, they
were knitting all kinds of regional cults and beliefs into a comprehensible
whole. Siva’s family and retinue offered a means, evidently, to incorporate
local divinities, including totemic animal gods such as the part-elephant
Ganapati. [50] Vishnu’s partisans, meanwhile, built on the theory of avatars to
locate in _his_ camp other regional gods. Ten incarnations are popular, while
the total of twenty-four is supposedly inspired by Jainism’s tradition of that
many spiritual teachers. [51] Individual avatars’ prehistories signal much: The
boar incarnation, thus, syncretized a pre-Aryan cult, while the man-lion
merged an animal deity into the tradition. [52] Why, as Buddhism—despised
with a vehemence by Brahmins once—declined, the Buddha too was recast
as an animal-friendly form of Vishnu, albeit a ‘deceptive’ one, sent to
bamboozle the wicked by vending falsehoods. [53]


-----

By design, therefore, the Puranas were quite flexible. Or as a Brahmin

wrote in 1804, through ‘their equivocal style, our devine [sic] Legislators
gave us an opening to reform any part . . . as change of circumstances and
vicissitudes of time may suggest’. [54] As ever larger tribes and societies were
drawn in, more and more redactions appeared, including sub-Puranas for
distinct regions and castes. [55] The longest in the scheme, the _Skandapurana,_
has even been described as a ‘scrap-bag’. In the indologist Wendy
Doniger’s words, every time someone ‘came upon a story that seemed to be
. . . old but did not . . . have any known provenance, he could remark,
without fear of contradiction, “It’s in the Skanda Purana”’. [56] To modern
minds, trained to look for chronological exactness, this could be frustrating.
One _sthala_ Purana—linking a sacred site to the grand narrative—was found
repeating a late corruption of a city’s name, instead of its historical
identifier, causing a nineteenth-century man to demand that, if nothing else,
the ‘holy’ text ‘surrender its insolent pretensions to antiquity’. [57] All sthala
Puranas, he warned, ‘profess to be integral portions of the old [main] 18
Puranas, but it is an open secret that their manipulation can scarcely be said
to have yet ended’. Indeed, there were even in the colonial-era ‘bards’ who
supplied Puranas ‘on order’ in convincing verse. [58] The _Bhavishyapurana_ ,
an ‘ancient’ text about the future, notes not only India’s Muslim sultans,
thus, but also a certain Victavati—Queen Victoria. [59]

But quibbling about historiographical wantonness is to miss the point, for

the Puranas are works of genius. They acquired their fluid form not to meet
present-day scholarly standards but to tie the local with the pan-Indian, and
the evolving with the stable; to universalize what was provincial, while
seeding the parochial with the universal. [60] Rising above geographical and
cultural plurality, everything was accommodated in an (admittedly
cluttered) Sanskrit master narrative. Even if tenuously, they established
links, unified disparate elements, all while giving the Brahmin vision of
society immortality by _owning_ traditions that otherwise might rise in
opposition. [61] As Vedic ritualism faded, thus, and new gods and cultural
spaces appeared on an ever-widening horizon, Brahmins linked this present


-----

to freshly forged pasts of myth and tradition. [62] Indeed, Brahmin culture too
was transformed; ‘like a python swallowing its prey whole, Brahmanism’s
feats of incorporation changed and distended its [own] shape’. [63] That is, as
Puranic Hinduism ingested diverse peoples and gods through its
‘gargantuan powers of assimilation’, its effects travelled along a two-way
street, leaving its Sanskrit synthesizers also altered. [64] Or as was stated with
a more negative spin, ‘Brahmanism having failed to conquer’, was itself
‘conquered by the multitudes’. [65] It was entirely natural, then, that the
resultant product—Hinduism—became a ‘macro-reality of organically
united micro-realities’: [66] a detail that would cause controversy, even
shame, in the colonial period, when under European influences religion was
imagined as more neat and coherent. [67]

The examples are fascinating. The Chenchu tribe in Andhra territory

became part of the great narrative after a myth invented a union between an
avatar of Vishnu and a Chenchu woman. [68] In Assam, the Ahom kings of
Southeast Asian Tai descent were Hinduized from the fourteenth century,
the process requiring hundreds of years. [69] Meanwhile, in merging the local
goddess cult with the Sanskritic, its ‘left-handed’ mode of worship
(featuring liquor and meat) was not only endorsed but adopted even for
Brahmin deities (who ordinarily receive flowers and milk). [70] In Tamil
country, a leading god, Aiyanar, was transformed into Siva’s son born of a
beguiling female form of Vishnu (horrifying a touchy European who felt
Vishnu could hardly be respectable if he committed ‘uncleanness’ with a
man). [71] In Maharashtra of the twelfth century, a pastoral deity, Vitthal, who
to this day commands love, became a Vishnu avatar, despite contestations
by Jains who claimed him as theirs. [72] Indeed, the process is still in play—
the Musahar community in Brahminism’s Gangetic home have two brother
deities; these have lately been recast as the sibling heroes from the epic
Ramayana, drawing this marginalized caste more firmly into the
Brahminical order. [73] Unsurprisingly, all this had its politics too: In Kerala
—a region where Brahmin ascendancy occurred relatively late—a goddess
who liked human sacrifice was persuaded to pull on with substitutes. But in


-----

the process, her non-Brahmin custodians were also ejected to make way for
Brahmin priests. [74]

Equally for Brahmins, however, while they attempted to construct

narrative unity, their own identity was sliced. Far from being a uniform,
well-oiled machine working in coordination, they imbued local colours and
peculiarities; different groups cultivated distinct traits and markers in a
concession to regional sensibilities. Thus, there were Brahmins entitled to
study the Vedas but also Brahmins denied it; there were vegetarian
Brahmins as there were those who ate more than grain and greens; [75] and
there were Brahmins who buried their dead, while most chose cremation. [76]

For the societies Brahmins penetrated also made demands of them.
Namboodiris in Kerala, for instance, adopted not only superficial aspects
linked to dress but also, initially, the local system of matrilineal succession.
77 Even native candidates for Brahminhood had to be accepted, the process
masked by Puranic tales. One tells, thus, of how Brahmins on the Konkan
coast were ‘created’ by a Vishnu avatar from the ‘funeral pyre of sixty
men’, so he could have assistance during a ritual. [78] Others in Maharashtra
—supposed, at some point, to have presided over human sacrifice—were
formed from camel bones, fertilized by the semen of an ass, this origin
myth obviously manufactured by rivals to denigrate. [79] Tribal priests,
absorbed into the Hindu scheme, were upgraded as Brahmins, [80] and
Iranian ‘sun-priests’ too were welcomed and rebranded as Maga Brahmins
in Rajasthan and Bihar. [81] It is not surprising, therefore, that even on the
cusp of modernity there were feuds about whether some Brahmins were
Brahmin at all. [82] Brahminhood _itself_ became a contested, jumbled category
—this was not one caste, but many: a factor that would cause inordinate
confusion to India’s British rulers in times ahead. [83]

Understandably, negotiation, including through economic and social

relations, underpinned all this. Country powers often invited Brahmins to
settle, not just to cement kingship but also for extending an organized
agrarian political economy, which held material incentives. [84] Thus, in north
Kerala, different groups-turned-castes slowly grew dependent on one


-----

another, this reflecting in their gods occupying slots in shared groves. As the
scholar Dilip Menon observes, ‘Deceased ancestors, local heroes and
heroines, gods of the Vedic pantheon, and nature gods all rubbed shoulders
in a seamless fabric of worship.’ [85] Families moving from the plains to
tribal uplands accepted carnivorous forest gods, the tribes reciprocating
with room for incoming vegetarian deities. [86] A Tamil story in which a
Brahmin figure’s severed head is attached to an outcaste’s body,
transforming her into a goddess, also hints at such ‘fusion’. [87] In the same
region, not only was an androgynous goddess turned into Siva’s wife, [88] but
at the festival marking this ‘marriage’, another god appears as a ‘guest’.
Deity to the Kallar tribe, he was reimagined as Vishnu, his inclusion in the
tale having something to do with bringing a refractory people under control.
89 Things did not always work out, though: At Devarapura in Karnataka, the
Kurubas celebrate the Kunde Habba (Ass Festival). Drunk and dressed in
drag, men hurl expletives at the deity for abandoning them and eloping with
a goddess, perhaps echoing a reluctant compromise. [90] Tellingly, even in the
eighteenth century, Brahmins were unwelcome here, risking torture in
politically fractious times. [91]

The bigger point, then, is that while Puranic culture grew into ‘a vast

ocean’, it is important to remember that ‘the Brahmanical stream, no matter
how big and forceful, still [represented] only one amongst numerous others
flowing into’ it. [92] What made the difference, however, was that Brahmins
went out of their way to identify each river and claim for it a common
source with others; in creating an overarching explanatory frame, they
sought unity while maintaining a formal supremacy for themselves and
their ideas. Indeed, though the Vedas became less and less relevant to the
everyday practice of Hinduism even for Brahmins, Puranic texts that did
actually matter were legitimized by constructing links, even if largely
nominal, with the Vedas. [93] And so long as the Vedas were not denied and
the caste superiority of Brahmins were accepted, practically anybody—
holding a variety of ideas—could be brought into the frame. [94] That way
Vedic texts remained _formally_ supreme even if it was a later, more mixed


-----

corpus that better represented religious reality—a situation we might
describe as a ‘win-win’.

It is this many-faced, multi-layered system that we today call Hinduism.

This was not a religion with one book or one fount. But what did press it
together was belief in similar myths and legends, told and retold in multiple
forms and languages. There was always a hill nearby where Rama rested, or
where characters from the Mahabharata dwelt; there was always a Puranic
story in which local people were part of a great cosmic event. [95] Indeed,
such was the popularity of the Puranas that the far-removed Vedic system—
theoretically Hinduism’s foundation—had little bearing on the lives of most
people considered Hindu. While an understanding of the Vedas endowed
scholars with respect, the fact that it had little immediate relevance even led
to jokes. A twelfth-century intellectual likened Brahmins to load-bearing
donkeys, with their archaic books, [96] and the term _chandasa_ , for Vedic
experts, also acquired a pejorative connotation, as ‘a stupid ritualist who
does not understand the ways of the world’. [97]

But the Brahmin _did_ , quite patently, understand the ways of the world.

He had to make room for gods he did not first recognize and for ideas that
rose up from other traditions. He did have to concede space to beliefs from
beyond his Sanskrit universe, shrewdly deploying the lament of the awful
kali yuga to excuse such pragmatism. So much so that most of what
constitutes Hindu culture today is ‘not . . . the offspring of Brahmanism as
its [child] by adoption’. [98] It was not the ideal scenario, of course, but it did
give Brahmin ideologies a foothold in many localities. Equally, the
provincial was not beholden to Brahmins, for it too shaped this narrative. [99]

But Brahmin elites—linked across regions by a shared language in Sanskrit
and a veneration for the Vedas—attempted to integrate the ideas of even
rivals into an amorphous whole, claiming every innovation as unblemished
tradition. [100] While Hindus had many ways and practices, then, it was
arguably Brahmins who helped sculpt Hindu _ism_ . And most importantly, this
endowed this class with control over the pan-Indian narrative—a source of
immense power, which would in time catalyse Hindu nationalism. [101]


-----

Simply put, every time new forces emerged, the Brahmin was equipped, in
return for preservation, to provide from his all-encompassing bag of myths,
material tailored to fit the moment. Indian civilization, after all, is built on
stories—and if it met anything unfamiliar, it simply absorbed it and told yet
more stories.

By 1000 CE , India’s cultural landscape was on the verge of fresh
transformations. Until then, just as Brahmins wooed all varieties of groups,
Buddhists and Jains too had employed similar strategies, often working
from an overlapping toolkit. For instance, if Buddhism evolved its own
gods and rites, to the extent of sometimes appearing like a mirror of its
rival, [102] the idea of a Buddha-yet-to-come found a Brahmin parallel in
Vishnu’s prophesized final avatar. [103] Many similarities extended even to
metaphysics and philosophy—the noted eighth-century theologian Sankara
is in friendly accounts cast as Siva-incarnate, born to decimate Buddhists,
while others (including critics from rival Hindu schools) accused him of
having simply dressed the Buddhist wolf in Brahmin clothing. [104] Suspicion
of Sankara’s philosophy—that the godhead is formless, eternal and infinite;
that the tangible world, including deities and rituals, is illusory—is not
surprising. Leaving aside theological hair-splitting, traditions built around
Siva, Vishnu and increasingly the supreme female energy, Shakti, prevailed
on the ground; to suggest these were illusory was controversial. All agreed,
of course, that there was only one paramount being, and that others were
subordinate manifestations. But depending on one’s leanings, for most, that
being was either Siva or Vishnu or Shakti—and these gods were perfectly
capable of acquiring different forms and personalities, touching the (equally
non-illusory) human world. [105]

Part of this commitment to a personified god, as opposed to the abstract

entity, was the result of _bhakti_ , or devotionalism. While local cults appear to
have always showed an affection for sacred spots with images, into the
early centuries CE pan-Indian faiths, including Sramanic traditions,
embraced the temple. [106] A complex system of worship would develop over
the next millennium, as gods, after due ceremony, took up residence in
images of wood, stone or metal. Worship was no longer about fire sacrifices
to invisible deities, or a philosophical acceptance of the almighty; the
emphasis moved to the individual _beholding_ divinity. Gods were
humanized: They could be cajoled, flattered, reprimanded, loved, spurned,
threatened but always embraced by emotion. [107] There were child gods, and
adult gods; gods who were angry in one shrine, benign in the next. Temple


-----

rites saw deities being roused in the morning, taken around in processions
and for baths (including post-menstrual dips), [108] celebrate marriages, and
do all that humans did—but on a scale befitting their status. Soon, royalty
became sponsors of temples: Valuable real estate was bestowed, and rulers,
advertising their power, assumed protectors’ duties. [109] In the peninsula,
thus, under the Pallava kings, great edifices began to emerge. [110] In time,
the temple evolved roles as banker, cultural timekeeper, economic engine
and a supplier of stability when political sands shifted. And as Brahmins
adapted to endorse and co-opt these novel forms of worship—which many
first scorned—bhakti received theological certification as a legitimate route
to liberation. [111]

Moreover, by the medieval period, early shoots of sectarian identities—as

defined now, where people perceive themselves as followers of a specific
faith—started making their appearance. As the historian Manu Devadevan
argues in the case of Karnataka, ‘(w)orshipping a deity was [hitherto]
simply a part of everyday life, not a marker of identity’; just as ‘wearing
cotton clothes, residing in a thatched hut or making love never produced
identities like cotton-wearer, thatched-hut-dweller, or love-maker, so also
the worshipping of Siva or Visnu . . . did not confer identities’. [112] This was
a spiritual bazaar where multiple groups peddled religious wares, to an
audience buying from all. Kings too, even when they had favourites, [113]

tended to balance groups: Inscriptions in Andhra style a Vishnukundina
ruler as a devotee of Siva in one record, while praising him as pro-Buddha
in another. Bengal’s Palas built Hindu temples even as they supported
Sramanic monks. [114] In Kerala, an Ay king preferred Vishnu but gave to
Siva too, while his heir aided Jains and Buddhists. [115] The Western Gangas
claimed Brahmin descent but served as patrons of Jainism without
hesitation. [116] While seemingly paradoxical, this mix and match had a logic:
Even Buddhist royalty had an incentive in upholding Brahmin theories on
caste, for example, viewed more as a sociopolitical instrument than as a
religious principle. [117] Temples entrenched this: The control of land meant
that shrines developed patronage networks, supporting musicians, priests,


-----

dancers, farmers, artisans and, over time, whole communities, all while
injecting into these specific social ideologies. [118]

Aiding this process of religious identity formation, especially at elite

levels, was the energy with which Puranic stories welded together diverse
physical temple sites. The result was the creation of what the scholar Diana
L. Eck has called a ‘sacred geography’, with pilgrimage becoming a
popular means to experience divinity; a path that did not involve asceticism
or monkhood. [119] Thus, in present-day Kurukshetra, a banyan tree marks
the ‘exact spot’ where Krishna in the Mahabharata imparted wisdom to
Arjuna, in his great preamble before battle. [120] Chadayamangalam on the
west coast is where the vulture Jatayu fell as he tried to prevent the evil
Ravana from abducting Rama’s wife in the Ramayana; and once Rama had
killed his enemy, it was at Rameswaram on the _east_ coast that he cleansed
himself, consecrating a temple. Dantewada in Chhattisgarh, known for a
goddess of tribal origins, was linked to Shakti and cast as the spot where a
_danta_ (tooth) from the corpse of Siva’s wife fell as he danced with it in
furious agony; her genitals fell in Assam in the north-east, her navel in
Tamil country, her hair in Karnataka, a breast in Bihar and a hand all the
way north in Kashmir. A single story, thus, entwined temples across vast
reaches, reinforcing the claim of an essential unity. [121] By encouraging
devotees to travel to such sites, not only were they told that they could gain
spiritual release, but it also generated a culture of commonality despite
different vocabularies, tongues and histories. Viewed this way, latter-day
India’s slogan of ‘Unity in Diversity’ acquires a different origin. [122]

That said, if there were currents binding temples and their surrounding

communities into a grand narrative, its politicization, elite domination and
growing ritualism (with attendant paranoias around caste purity) meant
dissent was not far away either. It was among Tamils, in the Tamil language
—which rivals Sanskrit in claims to literary antiquity—that bhakti emerged.
Indeed, poetic expression of this constitutes the oldest Hindu literature _not_
in Sanskrit. [123] Over several centuries, the songs of Tamil poet-saints
celebrated sacred spots. But when this devotionalism spread to Karnataka, it


-----

featured criticism. Here, Virasaiva thinkers eschewed temple worship,
adoring Siva through stone _ishtalingams_ carried by each believer instead.
Virasaiva ranks featured washermen, barbers, toddy-tappers, cobblers, sex
workers and burglars—sections less invested and likely to be included in
temple culture. [124] Basava, its leading voice, dismissing religious
complexes, [125] wryly remarked, ‘The rich will make temples for Siva. What
shall I, a poor man do? My legs are pillars, the body the shrine, the head a
cupola of gold. Listen, O lord . . . things standing shall fall, but the moving
shall ever stay.’ [126] On extravagant Brahminical rites and mantras, he
quipped: ‘Parrots recite. So what? Can they read the Lord?’ [127] Such bhakti,
which would engulf the subcontinent in diverse shapes, is often
romanticized as ‘Indian analogues to European protestant movements’; as a
religious culture ‘of and for the underdog’. [128] In other words, even in
devotional spaces, there was no one way, and diversity of approach
remained—a different dynamic from that stereotype of India as unchanging
and timeless. [129]

Was there, however, no conflict at all as these varied paths crossed each

other? Today, religious tension in India is imagined along a Hindu–Muslim
axis: There was an all-encompassing Hindu identity to which cruelty was
done by an invading faith. In actual fact, however, feuds were not
uncommon between partisans of Siva and Vishnu (Saivas and Vaishnavas),
and of both against Jains and Buddhists. Saiva poetry, thus, presents Vishnu
as subject to Siva; as one who cannot presume to even comprehend that
god. [130] Vaishnavas returned the favour by showing Siva as Vishnu’s
appointment, his followers ‘ignorant innocents’. [131] One Saiva saint is
eulogized for defeating Buddhists in a debate only to lose face when
jousting with a Vaishnava. [132] In a temple chronicle, the twelfth-century
Vaishnava saint Ramanuja flees Saiva persecution in one area, only to
convert the Jain king whose land he enters. [133] Even in the twentieth
century, Vaishnavas could ‘boast’ of having never patronized Saiva shrines.
134 That said, agents of Vishnu and Siva still worked within a common
‘religious ethos’ with ‘ubiquitous Puranic myths’; Sramanic rivals, on the


-----

other hand, were more alien. [135] Even in the oldest Tamil poetry, thus, the
bigger enemy is the Jain or Buddhist. [136] Rivalries between Siva and Vishnu
sought to _subordinate_ one to the other; feuds with Sramanic religions aimed
to vanquish them. Trenchant disputations were routine. A seventeenthcentury account claims, for example, that when once a Jain gave a dressing
down to his Brahmin rivals, they were so hopelessly emasculated that it was
a surprise ‘the townspeople did not lust after them as if they were women’.
137

By the eleventh and twelfth centuries, after sacred sites became

significant factors, such rivalries assumed violent proportions. Saiva
hagiographies are a case in point: In them, Vaishnavas are murdered for
telling ‘lies’ about Siva and an image of Vishnu is melted by a Saiva’s
power. [138] A bloody twelfth-century royal succession in Andhra saw two
factions backed by rival sectarian groups, [139] while in 1598, Saiva priests
jumped off a tower to protest the amplification of Vishnu in a prominent
Tamil temple town. [140] In 1789, Vaishnava and Saiva ascetics in
Maharashtra clashed over precedence during a ritual dip. [141] In fact, as late
as the 1860s, the predecessor of Madho Singh of Jaipur—who we met at the
start of this chapter—launched a campaign of oppression against
Vaishnavas after pledging his loyalty to Saivism. [142] Even so famous a
temple as Tirupati—among India’s most popular—witnessed disputes about
the identity of its deity. The image evidently features matted hair and
serpents—aspects typical of Siva—while a smear of sandalwood paste on
the forehead is said to conceal that god’s third eye. Though the deity holds
objects associated with Vishnu, that these are supposedly detachable
sparked suspicions. By the twelfth century, at any rate, Vaishnavas were in
control, arguing that Vishnu too in some contexts sports matted hair, and
that the articles were picked up by the deity personally. As for the
sandalwood mark, it does not conceal a third eye but a wound Vishnu
received when he took a blow to save a cow! [143] Yet again stories came to
the rescue.


-----

What can be inferred, then, is that from major shrines to obscure ones, it

was possible to reclaim and reinvent them according to shifting patterns—
something that direly affected the Sramanic religions once they lost out to
Puranic rivals. [144] Thus, what is now a Hindu temple in Nagercoil used to
be Jain in the sixteenth century. [145] Long before, kings in the Deccan
converted Buddhist shrines in Ellora chiselling out Buddhas to ensconce
Vishnu—those figures that were spared were, by the nineteenth century,
visualized as Hindu anyway. [146] Lord Curzon, viceroy of India, was startled
in 1903 when visiting Gaya—location of the Buddha’s enlightenment—he
found its temple in Saiva hands. [147]
148
At Kandiyur in Kerala, home to a ninthcentury Siva, a Buddha was discovered buried nearby. To the north, at
Paruvasseri, a Jain image, meanwhile, became Vishnu. [149] Violence and
natural calamities often tilted the balance: In Karnataka, it is estimated that
as many as 2000 Jain sites were destroyed or repurposed in the late
medieval period. [150] Saiva stories buttress such speculations: They show
their heroes coming across towns with ‘new Jain monasteries and temples’,
while Siva suffers ‘like a small fish in a pond surrounded by hungry
herons’. Rousing others to challenge the Jain ‘dogs’, they ‘uproot and
shatter’ their ‘dolls’. [151] Though the numbers are inflated, a single Saiva
saint is credited with killing 32,000 Jains, while another slaughters 8000.
152 Tamil poetry has a Vaishnava steal a gold Buddha to fund a temple for
Vishnu, [153] while another declares: ‘Snatch the rice from the mouths of
those who burden the earth! Stuff them with grass instead!’ [154] In fact, as
recently as a century ago, Tamil temple processions featured images
‘representing a Jain impaled on a stake’. [155]

India’s religious universe—both within the Puranic system as well as in

its dealings with faiths of the Sramanic kind—was clearly, thus, of
extraordinary complexity. Saivas and Vaishnavas baited one another, while
Buddhists and Jains were reduced to submission. [156] Caste became a
stringent part of existence, with some segments cast as so ritually impure as
to be untouchable. Even proponents of bhakti, while democratizing
devotionalism and access to god, hesitated to challenge caste in secular


-----

settings. [157] What is remarkable is that Brahmins nearly everywhere won
towering social positions, though again, this too was not without criticism.
The thirteenth-century _Basavapurana_ from the Andhra region is full of
hostility for them, for example. Here, Brahmins are cast as the ‘real’
untouchables: In one story, a lady, when brushed by one, takes a cleansing
bath; in another, an untouchable covers his (meaty) lunch to save it from a
Brahmin’s polluting (vegetarian) eyes, reversing the hierarchy. In the first
tale, the saint even has a dog recite the Vedas, to curdle Brahmin pride. [158]

As usual, however, enmity was tamed into compromise; near
contemporaneous with the _Basavapurana_ is another work, by a Brahmin, to
soften militant Saivism. [159] More effort would be invested in this direction
so that by the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, retellings of Saiva saints’
lives not only expunged dislike but proactively brought them in line with
Brahminical ideals. [160]

For Brahmins, though, there was no happy ending. For by then, India’s

religious and cultural landscape had been disrupted by another new force:
the creed of Muhammad.

Among the legendary rulers of Kerala on the western seaboard, with its
maritime history, were some who disappointed Brahmin chroniclers. One
king bought into Buddhist doctrines, we are told, until challenged by
Brahmins to a great debate. When his team lost, the man was banished from
the country. [161] Then there was another. Having committed an injustice, he
was denied atonement by the religions at hand; so, he took reprieve in an
option fresh off foreign merchants’ boats, called Islam. [162] Later retellings
are more colourful. Admiring the evening sky, this king one day witnesses
the splitting of the moon. Learning of Muhammad’s miracle from some
Arab traders, he divides his lands among vassals, boards a ship to the
Middle East and becomes a Muslim. [163] Whether or not the legend bears
truth, the tale of the convert king caught on. On the one hand, it legitimized


-----

a dozen Hindu dynasties along the coast as beneficiaries of the king’s
partition of territories. [164] But, on the other, it also carved out space for the
presence of a Muslim community in Kerala. Indeed, just as Brahmins
claimed they were settled in these parts by a Vishnu avatar, the story of the
convert rajah opened narrative windows for Islam also to smoothly slide
into local imagination. [165] As Muslims familiarized themselves with the
land, in other words, they too deployed stories comparable to those in the
Puranas. [166]

Islam’s advent in the _north_ , however, was not via networks of maritime

commerce but through battlefields—a bloodier setting where incentives to
blend in through creative writing were not urgent. Tales were, of course,
woven, but for foreign audiences—the eleventh-century raids of Mahmud
of Ghazni were magnified disproportionately in Arabic texts so as to
valorize him in the Islamic world as the bane of infidels. Though Gujarat’s
Somnath temple, which he plundered, was not special, it was positioned
before Muslim powers as the Mecca of idolatry. Indeed, in one account, the
Prophet having failed to destroy what becomes the idol in Somnath (!) is
asked by an angel not to fret; this specific deity is reserved for our king. [167]

Mahmud set a gold standard for Muslim raiders, among whom parading and
breaking idols proved a commitment to monotheism. [168] India, viewed as
the nerve centre of polytheistic image worship was fertile territory, thus, [169]

for his successors to both enrich themselves and to construct legitimacy. So,
while Somnath survived Mahmud’s iconoclasm, it kept attracting copycats.
Memories of these desecrations would acquire a life of their own. Not only
would the British attempt to ‘avenge’ Hindus in the Victorian age but
postcolonial India’s first president also laid the foundation stone personally
for the present temple, as if correcting a historical wrong. [170] Unlike in
Kerala, then, where mythmaking eased Islam’s entry, in the north, it would
come to be perceived by some as a devourer of Hindus, and a civilizational
adversary.

Understandably, responses to Islam see-sawed between these extremes,

depending on who was speaking. It was, as one mind frames it, a ‘strange


-----

combination of acceptance and rejection’. [171] An eleventh-century Buddhist
text, for instance, irreverently suggests that advocates of the Vedas might
gel gloriously with Islam, given their shared fondness for violence. [172] But
jibes aside, Brahmin intellectuals struggled, not least because it was tough
to draw the Muslim neatly into the Puranic universe. For already evolved
and packaged in the Perso–Arabic world, his religion was unlikely to
succumb to the typical overtures. Some of it was about principles—if
Brahmins ordered the world into castes, Islam, in theory, proposed
egalitarianism. [173] And while there was no single pan-Indian Hinduism,
Brahmins had, as we saw, formed a ‘consciousness’ of unity, to which
Muslim power posed a threat. [174] As a faith, Islam had, of course, been part
of India’s spiritual platter for some time, and by the eighth century, the term
_musalmana_ (Muslim) found its way into Sanskrit. [175] But joined to and
reinforced by autonomous _power_ , with alternate ideals of kingship, god and
self-expression, it loomed as a rival to Brahminism and its umbilical ties to
political authority. ‘For the first time in her history’ (or in a long time at any
rate), ‘India was to reconcile to the existence [and possibility] of a _separate_
culture-community’—something that, given the abruptness with which it
happened, triggered mixed feelings, its worst coming to a head with the
subcontinent’s partition in the 1940s. [176]

But this sense of separateness appears early on. For instance, in twelfth-

and thirteenth-century literary coverage of clashes between a Hindu king
and an invading Muslim counterpart. In his own courtly production, the
former is presented as Vishnu-incarnate, here to quell all the chaos
unleashed by foreign savages. [177] Their misdeeds include crashing temple
rites, eating meat, treating Brahmins with contempt and following a
lifestyle repellent to Hindu eyes. [178] On the Muslim side, meanwhile, a
Persian text employed comparable strategies: The Hindu is Satan’s
instrument; the sultan was fighting ‘enemies of the faith’; and he sought not
material profit but to advance the ‘Islamic way of life’. [179] Both professed
divine validation, posing as defenders of order. Such tall claims, in fact,
would become formulaic. Thus we have a fifteenth-century sultan described


-----

in Persian accounts as such a zealous infidel-killer that each time he
liquidated 20,000, he would throw a party. [180] So too a fourteenth-century
Hindu inscription is predictable when it reports how the ‘darkness of the
Turks’ having ‘enveloped the world’, the country, ‘tortured’ by the halting
of temple rites, was akin to ‘a forest engulfed by a rampaging fire’. [181]

While this reveals tension, how much reflected real violence and how much
polemics—as in feuds between Jains and Buddhists, Saivas and Vaishnavas
—is debatable. [182] And yet the existence of such tension is itself telling.

In any case, once Islamic power settled in India, as opposed to making

periodic visitations, its appetite for temple-smashing was much reduced. By
the thirteenth century, a Muslim dynasty was entrenched in Delhi, and its
armies would overwhelm most of the subcontinent. In the process,
kingdoms were conquered, Hindu royalty toppled and temples reduced to
rubble. [183] But thereafter, as a foreign elite ruling over a populous country,
compromises were inevitable. Or in the words of a vizier, Muslim power
was like salt in a dish—desirable but best sprinkled in moderation. [184]

Sultans issued coins with Sanskrit inscriptions and, over time, formed a
policy of tolerance, even if only out of practical considerations. [185] Parallel
acts of desecration did occur but as the scholar Richard Eaton phrases it,
Hindu sites suffered ‘on the cutting edge of [the sultanate’s] moving
military frontier’ as it expanded into new territories. [186] Yet, the threat was
ever-present: 400 years later, thus, the formidable Tipu Sultan in his home
provinces was a patron of shrines, honouring Hindu spiritual heads and
having temple rites performed in his name. But when he invaded Kerala
next door, without irony the same man deployed violent rhetoric, shattered
idols and proved a terror. [187] The reverse too occurred—Chhatrapati
Shivaji, founder of the Maratha state, in his seventeenth-century kingly
narrative is Vishnu manifested to destroy ‘unruly Muslims’. [188] This while
his father was apparently named after a local Muslim divine. [189]

Accommodation and suspicion, then, coexisted—a situation sustained into
the present.


-----

Better impulses did, of course, assert themselves, then as today. Indeed,

while contradictions were stressed during conflict, in everyday terms,
constructive exchange was inevitable. In the Deccan, thus, a Muslim
notable, impressed by Hindu thought in the sixteenth century, found himself
a guru. His desire to become a Brahmin was foiled, but Murtaza did
reincarnate himself in Sanskrit as Mrityunjaya. [190] In Bengal, the cult of
Satya Pir has its central figure combine Brahmin religious markers with the
garb of a Muslim fakir. [191] Seventeenth-century Karnataka was home to a
miracle-working Hindu, raised by Muslims, [192] while in Andhra, a Hindu
king and his Muslim vanquisher were reimagined as forms of Siva and
Vishnu. [193] In Maharashtra, similarly, the deity Khandoba received Muslim
veneration, [194] while in Sindh, some portrayed Ali as Vishnu’s newest
avatar. [195] In Benares—Hinduism’s most sacred city—a traveller saw
Muslims abandon Islam for the Brahmin’s faith. [196] Equally, the Muslim
saint Kabir grew so popular with Hindus that some posthumously gave him
a Brahmin pedigree. [197] Meanwhile, at the court in Delhi, the Mughal
emperor Akbar celebrated Hindu festivals and had a Veda and the
Mahabharata translated into Persian. [198] Pleased Brahmins issued
panegyrics likening him to a deity. [199] As for Somnath, once tormented by
Islamic powers, it soon became custom for local Muslims en route to Mecca
to ‘pay their _respects_ ’ here. [200] Why, attempts were made to concoct Puranic
origins for Islam itself: In one account, the Prophet springs from Vishnu,
while another suggests it was Siva who gave Muhammad leave to propagate
a new religion. [201]

Islam, then, was different but not ‘inexpressibly alien’, not least because

Muslims in India were themselves diverse and the opposite of a monolith.
202 Matrilineal Muslims in Kerala had more in common with their
matrilineal Hindu neighbours, for example, than with Deccan Muslims,
whose food, culture and general being was of a different order. For the most
part, people managed to live together, transcending disagreements. One
enabler was simply the country’s diversity. While Islam was distinct, this, in
a society full of plural identities, was not unusual. If Muslims were in


-----

Sanskrit narratives described as _asura_ s (demons) and mlecchas, the terms
were also used at times by Hindus against other Hindus. [203] Where Muslim
rulers destroyed temples, Hindu kings too—even if they did not demolish or
break idols—occasionally plundered them. So also while the sixteenthcentury philosopher Eknath produced a dialogue in which a Hindu and [204]
Muslim trade barbs, in another he challenges (intra-Hindu) caste prejudices.
205 That is, Hindus did not think of themselves as _only_ Hindus, viewed in
contrast to Muslims—that claim appeared in the modern period. Until then,
identities were shaped by multiple parameters such as caste and region and
language, religion being one of many factors. Thus, two persons might
share a linguistic identity as Telugu speakers, and yet have little intercourse
if one were Brahmin, the other ‘untouchable’. In fact, the Brahmin might
deal more regularly with Muslim authorities, serving as a bureaucrat or
cultural middleman, transacting in courtly Persian. [206]

Yet, the religious divide was not artificial or a colonial invention, as is

sometimes argued by the well-intentioned, who seek to bridge current
religious cleavages in India. For at an intellectual level, notions of ‘Us and
Them’ always persisted between Muslims and Hindu elites. After all, even
in efforts to reconcile Islam with Hinduism, recognition of each as
dissimilar is implicit. [207] Even under the kindest sultans, temple worship
was tolerated, not endorsed; Brahmins were respected, but no Muslim
power was likely to admit their pretensions to superiority. [208] A steady
undercurrent of suspicion remained, then. [209] And there was no shortage of
violence. In 1244, ‘Muslims were killed following an assault . . . by the
Hindus during _Id_ prayer’ in Haryana. [210] Despite Kerala’s culture of
tolerance, a mosque was attacked in the fourteenth century for tiling (as
opposed to thatching) its roof, and by this claiming parity with a temple. [211]

Fifteenth-century Kashmir saw Hindu and Muslim shrines set ablaze, in
addition to provocative cow slaughter. [212] A Hindu rajah in Rajasthan, was,
for opposing Mughal inroads, saluted in religious language: he denies ‘the
kalamam ( In seventeenthcentury Karnataka, conflict occurred when Hindus took an idol of Ganapati _kalima_ )’ and elevates the ‘veda-purana’. [213]


-----

by a Muslim shrine; they were decried as ‘infidels’ with an ‘accursed’ deity.
214 Some decades earlier, in a Telugu text, a southern emperor is shown
viewing both the Hindu king of Orissa and a neighbouring sultan as
enemies; but the former is a notch better for keeping faith in the right gods.
215 One especially graphic statement comes from a Bihar-born poet in the
early 1400s:

The Hindus and the Turks live close together.

Each makes fun of the other’s religion.
One calls the faithful to prayer. The other recites the Vedas.

. . . The Turks coerce passers by into doing forced labor.
Grabbing hold of a Brahmin boy, they put a cow’s vagina on his head.

They rub out his _tilak_ [forehead mark] and break his sacred thread . . .

They destroy temples and construct mosques. [216]

-----

To sum up, then, ingredients always existed in India to support a binary
between Muslims and non-Muslims. And in some contexts and spaces, this
alerted Hindus—despite their various differences—to the _possibility_ of
political oneness. That is, if Brahminism held a ‘consciousness’ of unity,
faced with an opponent, that feeling would slowly harden. In the modern
age—which pushed political integration, introduced technology such as the
press and the need to stand up to colonialism—new meaning was invested
in broad-based labels. Two ideas appeared of the Indian nation: a pluralistic
one with room for all, celebrating syncretic aspects of the Hindu–Muslim
encounter. And another, equating India with a Hindu nation, galvanized by
memories of persecution by Muslim kings and, as we shall see, Christian
colonialists. Logic could be found for both. Emperor Jahangir, for example,
was transfixed by a Brahmin ascetic called Chitrup in 1617. [217] ‘Without
exaggeration,’ he diarized, ‘it was hard for me to part from him.’ [218] They
bonded over spiritual issues, finding plenty of common ground—evidence
that Hindu and Muslim could get along. [219] And yet, the same monarch also
once, almost on a whim, destroyed a temple and its ‘hideous’ idol—
confirmation for the cynical that Islam could never be truly trusted. [220]

Chitrup too affirmed his separate identity. When asked what he thought
about the Prophet, he replied: ‘You yourself say he was sent by God. He is
the guide of the people to whom the True King has sent him. He need not
trouble himself about us, courtiers of the Almighty.’ [221] Islam had value for
those who believed in it, he seemed to argue. But for those who met god
through other paths, the divine message was already clear.

As always, in India, even if the destination were the same, the road could

never be one. And as much as this could be read as pluralism, ever present
was also the prospect of disunion.

It is possible that by now the reader of this rambling essay will relate to an
eighteenth-century padre’s frustration. ‘These heathens,’ he grumbled, ‘are


-----

very shifting in their discourses. One tells me one thing and another
something different.’ [222] Or perhaps we declare too many things at once, all
of which happen to be true. He deserves sympathy, either way, for Indians
also are likely to find the country’s religious evolution bewildering. Masked
under that disarmingly plain term ‘Hinduism’ is a many-layered
phenomenon—from a leaner Vedic personality, it became something richer
in the Puranic age; exchanges with tribal cults, Buddhism, Jainism and
Islam activated fascinating transformations. Things were perplexing enough
by the early modern era, until the arrival of European powers—and, in their
wake, politically backed Christianity—slapped on a fresh coat of
complexity. Alongside came other upheavals. The Mughals stretched their
power to its limits, and when Akbar’s great-grandson died in 1707, their
empire went into decline. Emboldened vassals shook themselves free, and
in the resultant flux, a petty overseas venture—the English East India
Company—inched out from its coastal enclaves to become a great
hegemon. It is the story of Hinduism in this period that makes up the rest of
this book; or specifically, the context in which Hindu nationalism—
Hindutva, so dominant now in India—found its raison d’être. This is not,
then, a study of the religion across the ages but a survey of 400 years at
most—a span that supplies the historical setting and much of the emotional
stimulus empowering present-day Hinduism.

It is often argued, however, that Hinduism is a Western ‘invention’; that

before the modern era, there were just castes, sects and a heap of
contradictory traditions, possessing none of the streamlined clarity
associated with Christianity and Islam. Certainly, ‘Hinduism’ as a term is of
recent vintage. It appeared first as a label for foreigners to lump together
unfamiliar people. And yet, once created, Hindus seized that expression,
recognizing something familiar there. To suggest this was passive
acquiescence in a foreign-made identity is simplistic. [223] As we saw, the
encounter with Islam had initiated a feeling of oneness among Hindu
thinkers, building on an older unifying Brahminical impulse. Confronted by
colonialism, such instincts grew firmer, and Hindus themselves invested
substance in the outsider’s name tag. Hinduism was not ‘invented’; it


-----

represents the latest milestone in a long-running religious process. Like a
river that might originate in small streams, this one too had many
beginnings. But it has been flowing for long, only picking up a new name at
a bend along the way. So, while the name is modern, the river is old.
Besides, to compare Hinduism in a blanket sense to Christianity and Islam
is to presume that religions must all fit one template to qualify; that
anything which does not meet certain parameters—prophets, a core set of
codes—is somehow a pretender. The fact, however, is that religions can
emerge in different forms in different places, just as they might borrow
from one another. Historically, Hinduism did not fit the mould of bookbased religions, though in its modern form, it does appropriate many of the [224]
latter’s features. In the past, it was like an ever-expanding tapestry of
uncertain shape; modern dynamics, however, hastened the stitching-up of
its outer borders.

This closing of the door is the principal focus of this book. And, as we

shall see, it was born of a sustained and often painful interaction with the
colonial West. We will begin with Europe’s early encounters with Hindus—
a phase in which white men met a new culture but treated it not with open
minds but jaundiced eyes. Indeed, European ideas of Hinduism were in
good measure shaped by their own cultural and political preoccupations;
they saw what they _wished_ to see and interpreted Hindu culture to suit
predetermined priorities, as highlighted in the first two chapters. By itself,
this would not have mattered—on the contrary, Christianity looked like it
was growing worryingly Hinduized in India. But having gained power,
white men’s slanted perceptions acquired force. Hindus would now begin to
look at themselves in a mirror crafted by foreign hands, seeing a somewhat
distorted reflection: The making of this mirror is the theme in chapters three
and four, as brown men under white rule came to terms with what was
being projected. And yet, ‘native’ minds were not blank slates. Or as an
annoyed missionary put it, ‘It is possible for a Hindu to have his whole soul
apparently absorbed in a subject, and yet for his real thought to be as far
from it as the east is from the west.’ [225] With growing assaults on Hindu
culture—the subject of the fifth chapter—‘native’ agency asserted itself.


-----

And as the final two sections of the book demonstrate, this took the form of
both an internal soul-searching, as well as external resistance, leaving
Hindu society transformed yet again. That is, if the British had certain
ideas, Hindus too had distinct motivations; in remaking themselves, they
ingested part of the colonial fare—strategically finding parallels within their
traditions—refusing to swallow the rest. The result was a hybrid: old in
many respects but also renewed to survive the modern world and its
pressures.

There is a saying, though, that to look for the ancestry of saints, and the

origins of rivers is an enterprise fraught with peril, bringing, as it does,
mainly disappointment. The same could apply to investigating modern
Hinduism. The religion today has a grand, linear narrative which, to its
most rigid believers, is the only truth. They see an eternal faith, above
history and even the possibility of scholarly scrutiny. To try and study how
all this acquired its current appearance under the domination of strangers,
226 is possibly hopeless at best, controversial at worst. But I take the risk,
for it is a remarkable story, featuring mahatmas and polemicists,
missionaries and ‘natives’, little gods and great gods, text and tradition, and,
of course, foreigners of different persuasions. There is battle, of men and
ideas both. There is the ascent of prejudice, which did more damage than
wars of conquest. There is colonization not only of land and resources but
also of the mind and its frameworks. But it is a story of defiance too,
aspects of which are bloody, others cerebral. Crucially, colonialism seeded a
feeling among many Hindus that their identity needed muscle; and in
forging this defensive frame, they would position themselves against the
West and Muslims both. That colonialism gave Hinduism a new look is just
another turn in a history full of reinvention. Yet, its _political_ consequence is
also an exclusionary creed. This, to some Hindus, is an aberration: the
repulsive offspring of a saintly mother. Advocates of militant Hinduism,
however, view things differently. Faced, they would argue, with dangerous
rivals in Islam and Christianity, Hindus cannot but fortify their new, unified
identity. Pluralism sounds charming, but regimentation is essential to


-----

survival. That wrathful child was born for a reason, they insist, and in the
following chapters we examine its advent.

What this book is _not_ is a history of Hindu philosophy or of the lofty

ideas of ancient sages. It is not a study of the Vedas and holy texts, or a
quest to unearth deep meanings obscured in theological traditions. It is only
an investigation into human action and reaction, in a context of political
conquest, cultural domination and resistance. For those who prefer happier,
more syncretic aspects of Hinduism’s history—which are, without question,
inalienable parts of it—or a romantic celebration of the faith, proceed no
further. The pages ahead offer something rather less reassuring.

But while this is not a comforting account, it will, hopefully, prove

interesting. And in its own way, illuminate why things are the way they are
in the land of the Hindus.

#### ONE

 MONSTERS AND MISSIONARIES

In November 1579, three devout Christians set out from the Konkan coast
for the capital of Akbar the Great in upper India. They were servants of the
Society of Jesus, an order of Catholic priests founded a few decades before,
and locally headquartered in the Portuguese enclave of Goa. The leader of
the party was Rodolfo Acquaviva, scion of one of Italy’s wealthiest noble
houses, who had jettisoned all aristocratic pretensions for the Jesuit’s
cassock. With him were Francis Henriquez and Antonio Monserrate—the
former a Persian convert and the latter a Catalonian. [1] Their combined quest
was to win over the Mughal emperor himself, whom they knew as
Zelaldinus Equebar (Jalaluddin Akbar). He had, after all, personally
summoned them, asking that they bring Christian texts ‘in order that we
may learn the Law and its full meaning and perfect truths in every respect’.
2 Upon arrival in February 1580, they were welcomed formally first and
then at a private reception, where the emperor, to general amusement,
appeared in European cloak and hat. Habitually, Akbar offered his guests a
mass of gold, but riches did not excite the missionaries; instead, it was his
warmth that made an impression. As Monserrate reported ecstatically,
‘these signs foretold the speedy conversion of the king to the true religion
and the worship of Christ’—a case of wishful thinking if ever there was
one. [3]

The season in which the Jesuits arrived was bubbling with controversy,

the emperor having irritated the Muslim _ulema_ (clergy) at court. Only
recently he had obtained a document from the most prominent of them,
ceding him authority in adjudicating religious disputes—a decree signed
unwillingly by many who thought it a scandalous encroachment. But it was


-----

hardly the first time Akbar deviated from orthodox ideals: A few years
earlier, he had also established a ‘house of worship’ where rival disputants
debated theological ideas. Alongside Muslims, this _ibadat khana_ also
hosted Brahmins, Jains, Zoroastrians and others, who could loudly express
scepticism and challenge one another’s beliefs. When our three Jesuits
arrived, therefore, they were invited to also join, though their passion—and
unfamiliarity with court etiquette—meant it was a disaster: The emperor
had to take them aside and ask them to mind their language after an
outrageous inaugural performance. [4] Nonetheless, Acquaviva and his
friends remained hopeful. On receiving the Bible, not only did Akbar kiss
and raise each volume over his head, he also asked which one contained the
gospel and ‘showed yet more marked reverence to it’. [5] Soon, they were
requested to translate the text into Persian, while the emperor, to the horror
of some, placed one of the imperial princes under the visiting fathers’
tutelage. [6]

This intellectual climate in the Mughal court flowed chiefly from Akbar’s

uncommon keenness to interrogate received wisdom and ancestral
convictions of all stripes. Ruling over a diverse, multicultural society,
imperial policy had evolved into one of _sulh-i-kul_ where, as his heir wrote,
‘there was room for practitioners of various sects and beliefs’, on the
understanding that ‘all religions have a place within the spacious circle of
God’s mercy’. [7] Even the grand gateway to the chief mosque in the capital,
Fatehpur Sikri, carried an inscription celebrating the teachings of Jesus, [8]

with the quote: ‘The world is a bridge; pass over it but build no house upon
it.’ When Zoroastrians brought a holy fire, Akbar publicly prostrated before
it to show respect. [9] And, of course, there was Hindu influence that upset
conservative Muslim courtiers, their resentment an ill-concealed secret; one
merry Hindu writer even claimed that Akbar’s was really a Hindu
government. [10] To the Jesuits this was all quite confusing. As they recorded
—in a way revealing as much about themselves as their subject—given the
emperor’s attitude, it was surprising that ‘Zelaldinus has not yet been
assassinated’. [11] For they too viewed Akbar’s heterodoxy as a character


-----

defect. ‘He cared little,’ Monserrate reported grimly, ‘that in allowing every
one to follow his own religion he was in reality violating all religions.’ [12]

At a personal level, of course, Akbar remained very encouraging of the

Jesuits, which kept them motivated in their endeavour to bring him to Christ
—he was once seen walking with an arm around Acquaviva’s shoulders, a
mark both of ease and favour. [13] They accompanied him on a major military
campaign also: a rebellion by his brother in Afghanistan orchestrated by
some of the ulema as a concrete measure against Akbar’s alleged heresies.
Why, the emperor entertained their unsolicited advice even on topics not
their concern: Once the pious fathers encountered a group of transgender
people and were apoplectic that ‘such a class’ were allowed in the capital.
They recommended that ‘these libertines’ be banished ‘as though they were
a deadly plague’ or ‘burnt up by devouring flames’. Amused, Akbar
laughed. [14] But his tolerance of ideological diversity was certainly a
perplexing substance, and the Jesuits had no desire to evaluate their own
dogmas against the emperor’s yardstick of reason. Debates in and out of the
ibadat khana could grow heated, and Akbar, while venerating Mary and
Jesus, steadfastly refused to believe god had produced a son through a
virgin. [15] Frustrated, Acquaviva soon complained: ‘Nothing, Father, and I
say it with tears, nothing strikes the air but that diabolical name [of
Muhammad]. Scarcely ever do we hear the most sweet name of Jesus. For
the Moors only call him Jesus the Prophet, and say that he is not the Son of
God.’ [16]

It was late in the day before the fathers realized that Akbar had no

intention of converting at all—his interest lay in grasping the principles of
each competing faith to craft a new philosophy for himself as a monarch,
and in scrutinizing all religions fairly. Even as he discussed Christian
thought, he was bowing to the sun, drinking holy Ganga water, banning
animal slaughter [17] and otherwise flirting with multiple traditions—a
‘fickleness’ unbearable to the Jesuits. [18] It also did not help that Mughal
officers in the south were soon at war with the Portuguese; when the
emperor explained that it was triggered by local provocations, Monserrate


-----

dismissed this on the grounds that ‘no reliance must be put on the oath of a
Musalman, since Muhammad himself teaches that it is lawful to swear
falsely to an enemy’. [19] In the end, the Jesuits withdrew, for they did not
wish to give the emperor ‘the pearls of the Gospel’ simply so he could
‘tread and crush [them] under his feet’ to satisfy some ungodly curiosity. [20]

Henriquez took off in 1581 and the next year Monserrate followed; by the
time Acquaviva departed in 1583, their chief consolation was the
‘discovery’ of Tibet further north, where ‘a great harvest’ of ‘white’
heathens, untarnished by Muslim influence, could, it was hoped, be reaped.
21

That, however, was a task for others. For soon after his return to Goa,

Acquaviva was hacked to death when some companions and he planted a
cross at the site of a smashed Hindu temple. At a time when the Inquisition
promoted militant orthodoxy (more on that later) in Portuguese dominions,
the fathers had been free to speak as they wished in the Mughal court: The
Prophet was ‘a wicked and impious villain’; [22] Islam was merely ‘the
superstition of Muhammad’; [23] the Quran was ‘stuffed with countless
fables’ and ‘extreme frivolity’; [24] and, since polygamy was sin, even
Akbar’s wives, save one, were ‘courtesans and adulteresses’. [25] In fact, the
Jesuits themselves were surprised they got away with such potentially lifethreatening declarations. ‘Will these Musalmans never martyr us?’ cried
Acquaviva, yearning for a glorious Christian end. [26] No, sighed his
colleagues gloomily, for Akbar was too fond of them, so ‘no one dare[s]
touch us’. [27] It was far away from Zelaldinus and angry ‘Moors’, then, that
the heroic death Acquaviva sought came to him, from a mob of Hindus in
that broken Goan temple. When news of his violent end reached Fatehpur
Sikri, the emperor was upset. ‘Alas, Father!’ he is reported to have
exclaimed, ‘Did I not tell you not to go away? But you would not listen to
me.’ [28] Perhaps it was because a lot of what Akbar had to say seemed ahead
of its time; and for his single-minded Jesuit friends this was too much to
bear.


-----

While the chief antagonists of the Jesuits in the Mughal court were its
Muslim scholars, on the way there, the three fathers had observed some
Hindu practice too. To begin with, they were annoyed that their escort spent
a long time resting in the port of Surat, waiting for the stars to realign
auspiciously before resuming the journey—a delay made less infuriating
only by the sight of people arriving to look at their images of Mary and
Jesus and according these the same honour Akbar would. [29] In Mandu, they
were puzzled to see ‘a fragment of a huge iron gun’ being worshipped, [30]

while the festival of Holi, witnessed in Narwar, scandalized them: Where
men and women celebrated the advent of spring, splashing each other with
water and colours—a tradition still alive—the fathers saw ‘savage and
degraded’ public conduct. [31] Thereafter in Gwalior, ‘thirteen rude statues’
provoked their ire, though this may be because they suspected these
monumental Jain sculptures as representing Christ and his apostles. [32]

Muslim sites too were decried, of course: Islamic ‘religious zeal’ from
earlier times meant the horizon featured numerous ruined temples,
substituted with ‘shrines of wicked and worthless Musalmans’ who were
‘worshipped with vain superstition as though they were saints’. [33] All in all,
in their view, there was nothing to report on the way to Akbar but idolatry
and fraud. India was a pagan land governed by only marginally better
Islamic power.

Of course, everything the Jesuits conveyed passed through specific lenses

of cultural difference and missionary exaggeration—a pattern built over
several years. This was partly to loosen the purse strings of wealthy patrons
at home, reminding them of the ‘barbaric’ conditions in which the fathers
toiled but partly also to entertain with tales of the unusual and exotic. After
all, as the founder of the Society of Jesus wrote, there was a massive
appetite in Europe for news of foreign lands. And such information—‘sauce
for the taste of a certain curiosity’—was to be generously supplied. [34] In a
1593 Jesuit encyclopaedia by one of Acquaviva’s contemporaries, a section
was, thus, dedicated to the art of letter writing, and the need to know one’s
audience. As the author explained, citing Cicero, the Roman statesman,
there was ‘one method of writing letters for republics, another for princes or
monarchs, and yet another for those who guide the Church’. [35] The result
was that the Jesuits knew what, featuring sufficient quantities of bravado
and ‘sauce’, would appeal to general readers, and what made for sober
internal circulation. Criticism of such tilted narratives emerged within the
order itself, with complaints that these generalizations led to ‘features of
one particular case’ being applied across the board, birthing all varieties of
stereotypes, [36] while translation, editing and selective excerpting also
served to sensationalize, not enlighten. But, grumbling notwithstanding, the
Jesuits’ letters remained a powerful source of knowledge about India, in the
process cementing clichés that still endure.

Many of these stereotypes, to be sure, were not inventions of the Society

and its fathers. For centuries prior, information about India, much of it
spurious and even laughable, had been trickling West. Marco Polo’s diary
from the thirteenth century was an influential model, for instance. As the art
historian Partha Mitter notes, Polo was among the first to describe
_devadasi_ s, or female temple servants, when he wrote of ‘abbeys in which
are gods and goddesses to whom many young girls are consecrated’, who
on holy days, ‘sing and dance before the idol with great festivity’. [37] By the
fifteenth century, this found visual representation through a Parisian
illustrator, except that, having never witnessed what he drew, the picture


-----

was a peculiar mash: The devadasis took the form of European nuns,
complete with robes and veils, dancing before an image, also dressed like a
Catholic sister. This ‘putting [of] European clothing on an Indian subject’
became a ‘constant feature of the early Western image of Indian gods’ as
well. [38] For few Europeans had direct experience of the topics they
described, with the result that unChristian subjects were pressed into readymade, more familiar Christian templates. As multi-armed, many-headed
Hindu deities were heard of, these too were retrofitted into available
medieval categories. Or as Mitter tells, ‘classical monsters and [pagan]
gods, Biblical demons and Indian gods were all lumped together’ in one
universal master class: that of ‘monsters’. [39]

This perception of pagan gods as devils lay in Europe itself, and in

Christianity’s early phase of expansion. In seventh-century Rome, for
example, when the Pantheon was seized and turned into a church—which it
still remains—the gods who resided there were branded a ‘multitude of
devils’. So also, early missionaries to Britain found locals conducting
animal sacrifices; the deities receiving these were lumped under the same
term. [40] Idols were bad, and memoirs of pious Christian figures often speak
of their breaking these, physically as well as via miraculous powers. One
sixth-century bishop in France could not understand why pagans were so
‘angry’ when men with the ‘thought of God’ burned their shrines and asked
them to stop praying to trees and springs. In resisting, they were ‘deserting
the light and running to darkness’. [41] The prevailing Christian belief, after
all, was that pagan gods were attendants of Satan who had been cast out
from heaven; it was demonic powers that ‘persuaded men to build them
temples, to place there images or statues of wicked men and to set up altars
to them, on which they might pour out the blood not only of animals but
even of men’. [42] In St Augustine’s words, ‘pagans were under the power of
demons . . . [who] wanted to pass themselves off as gods.’ [43] Stories
abounded, especially as idols in pre-Christian Europe were destroyed, of the
foul forces concealed within. In one case, ‘flies of unusual size’ flew out of


-----

a broken image; elsewhere a ‘demon in the shape of a dark animal’ sprang
from a shrine that was dismantled. [44]

Received (un)wisdom of this variety was to go a long way in framing

India and its culture in the West now. [45] Thus, for example, by the time the
Dutchman Jan Huyghen van Linschoten joined Portuguese service in Goa
in the year of Acquaviva’s death, it was normal to describe gods in temples
as demons. Or as the man wrote, Hindu shrines housed ‘Idoles’ that were
‘cut most ugly, and like monstrous Devils’. Indeed, the devil _spoke_ through
these images, which was why Hindus venerated him and made offerings: ‘to
keepe friendshippe’ and ensure ‘hee should not hurt them’. Their religion,
in other words, was not about finding the light as much as cowing to
darkness—the opposite of Christianity. [46] Once van Linschoten passed by
some villages and ‘at everie hil, stonie Rocke or hole’ there was a ‘Carved
Pagode, or rather Devils, and monsters in hellish shapes’. An image he saw
on this journey was ‘so mishaped and deformed’ that that it surpassed all
the ugliness so far suffered—the deity (probably Narasimha, the man-lion
form of Vishnu) had ‘hornes, and long teeth that hung out of his mouth,
down to the knees, and beneath his Navel and belly it had an other such like
face, with . . . tuskes’. There was on its head something ‘not unlike the
Popes triple crown’ so that ‘in effect it seemed to be a monster [of the]
Apocalips’. [47] No matter which way he looked, van Linschoten saw in
Hindu gods the very creatures Christian mythology warned the faithful to
beware. To Indians, of course, these images were ‘visual theologies’ and
‘visual scriptures’, [48] but, made of black stone and housed in dark
sanctums, outsiders conjured up unpleasant associations.

Interestingly, these descriptions were recycled formulaically by European

travellers, resulting in a standardized (and negative) image of Hindu
culture. [49] Indeed, there is a strong chance that our Dutchman plagiarized
his reports from a man who preceded him by decades. Ludovico di
Varthema, an Italian, in an account published in 1510 spoke of gods on the
Kerala coast. ‘The King of Calicut is a Pagan,’ begins the relevant section,
and he worshipped a ‘devil’ called Deumo—a distortion of the Malayalam
_deivam_ , or god. [50] On the doors of Deumo’s shrine were wooden devils, but
the chief idol was metal. Revealingly, di Varthema added how this
particular deity had ‘a crown made like that of the papal kingdom, with
three crowns; and it also has four horns and four teeth, with a very large
mouth, nose and most terrible eyes’. Its hands were like ‘a flesh hook, and
the feet like . . . a cock’. [51] While van Linschoten’s description of what he
saw is suspiciously similar (as is Johan de Mandelslo’s from the
seventeenth century, which may, in turn, have been ‘borrowed’) [52] , di
Varthema himself was hardly being original. He claimed to have also seen a
Sathanas (Satan) seated in a flame of fire, ‘wherein are a great number of
souls’, one drawn into its mouth, and another ensnared by hand. As Mitter
notes, this was just a lazy description of Satan as painted in pictures of hell
in _Europe_ . [53] In other words, even as travellers related sights they had seen
in Hindu lands, they also consciously manufactured material, inspired by
medieval tropes, in the interests of titillating their audience. [54]

In fact, though things had improved from the age when India was thought

to be home to talking serpents and one-eyed beings, there was yet much


-----

nonsense published overseas. Leaving aside Marco Polo’s bundle of
overstatements, there was one like Odoric Mattiussi who in the early
fourteenth century described in coastal India an idol ‘which is half man and
half ox’ and ‘giveth responses out of its mouth’. This god, the Italian friar
insisted, consumed ‘the blood of [exactly] forty virgins’ regularly, so that if
in the pure Christian world parents vowed to give children to church
service, in India fathers and mothers pledged their offspring’s heads. [55] He
also reported in Kerala a tradition of widow burning; that is, if a dead man
left a wife, ‘they burn her alive with him, saying that she ought to go and
keep her husband company’. [56] It is an odd remark, for while sati was
indeed practised in many places in India, Kerala is one region where it was
explicitly prohibited. [57] As late as the nineteenth century, when a migrant
wished to burn herself thus, local authorities denied permission, offering to
escort her to a neighbouring territory instead where the act was acceptable.
58 Could it be that Mattiussi was mechanically recycling Marco Polo, 59 in
an attempt to seem ‘authentic’, only to accidentally apply his claim to the
wrong geography? In any case, sati quickly became an essential ingredient
in travelogues, down to the British era, with the consequence that a real but
hardly national custom, limited to certain classes and places, [60] was
identified as a defining feature of Hinduism—a rhetorical handle that in
time justified the British Raj’s own quest to ‘civilize’ India.

Additionally, given that such travelogues were sparse in number, each

possessed the capital to launch stereotypes. Mattiussi, thus, claimed to have
seen on the east coast a ‘wonderful idol’ of gold, seated on a gold throne, in
a temple—throwing originality to the wind—also constructed of ‘pure
gold’. Every year, this deity, ‘as big as St Christopher is commonly
represented’, drove out in a ‘fine chariot’ for a procession. Alongside music
and gaiety, there was, however, a bloody custom of ritual suicide that saw
hundreds ‘cast themselves under the chariot so that its wheels may go over
them . . . and cut them in sunder’. [61] This, then—which in all likelihood
was mostly a misreading of accidents or occasional overzealousness—
became the latest staple in travel diaries, its horror inspiring a heap of


-----

supposed eyewitness accounts. Nicolo de Conti, in the fifteenth century,
thus, claimed that in Vijayanagara—where the emperor maintained a
humanly impossible 12,000 wives—there was a festival in which devotees
were run over, [62] and van Linschoten in the next century similarly told of
people being madly ‘crushed to peeces’. [63] Then came Adolph Bassingh in
the 1600s noting not only ‘curious and horrific’ idols in India but also the by
now familiar mode of voluntary death by chariot wheel. [64] At this time,
these processions were associated with unnamed southern shrines, but by
the British era, the ritual came specifically to revolve around the temple at
Puri in Orissa, inspiring a hundred missionary pamphlets lambasting the
savagery of Hindu idolatry. [65]

Such repeated confirmation in travel accounts of India’s barbarity was

essential to promoting in Europe its own sense of civilization. [66] Often, it
also had more to do with events and anxieties in Western societies than a
curiosity about the East. Sati, for example, was repeatedly presented as a
custom invented to prevent wives from poisoning their husbands and
running off with lovers—a theory first offered by ancient Greeks. Van
Linschoten asserted so, noting matter-of-factly that since Indian women
were ‘leacherous and inconstant’, they disposed of their men ‘to have the
better means to fulfil their lusts’. [67] Less than twenty years after him,
another man adapted the story to Rajputs in the north, claiming they burned
widows because of an epidemic of murderous wives. [68] In 1689 an English
chaplain could not resist writing on that ‘libidinous disposition’ which
tempted brown women to liquidate their spouses. [69] However, as more than
one scholar has shown, this interpretation of sati as a preventive to
homicidal female tendencies may well have been Western eyes giving a
European logic to an Indian custom, absent as it is in Hindu and Islamic
accounts. For in late medieval _England_ , women who conspired against their
husbands were burned alive, [70] and in continental Europe too, there were
cases of female poisoners. White men observing sati in India, that is, seem
to have imported for it an origin myth from their own shores. [71] Many were
also keen to play hero, with travellers competing to claim they tried to


-----

dissuade sati-elects. [72] Indeed, in one tale, a gallant (but conveniently
anonymous) ‘Christian soldier’, unable to save a lady, falls into a fevered
state and himself dies. [73]

At any rate, if Hindu women were not paying for their murderous

propensities by being set alight, they were allowing desire to run amok,
letting European observers indulge in all kinds of fantasies. John Ovington
wrote in the seventeenth century that in Surat, women possessed clandestine
networks to pick men off the streets to pleasure them—in one case a lady
discovered unhappily that a person so brought to her bed was her lawfully
wedded husband. [74] There was a festival, a later account adds, in which
women fornicated with strangers, risking incest, and left behind
handkerchiefs as trophies. [75] When in 1621, a grandson of Akbar’s was
killed, another traveller explained how a shrine built to the dead prince
attracted many. Except that this became a means for ‘secluded ladies’,
otherwise trapped and sexually starved in harems, to give their passion ‘the
food for which it hungered’, choosing from a buffet of male pilgrims. [76] In
Calicut, meanwhile, the king allowed his Brahmin priests to sleep with his
wife before he touched her; [77] and among the region’s polyandrous Nairs,
not only did women simultaneously maintain ten husbands, these men were
‘Slaves’ to the sinister ‘Charms’ of their oversexed wives. [78] Hindu girls
even congressed with idols: Before virgins were wed, they offered their
‘mayden-head’ to stone, ivory or metal genitals of gods. Their bridegrooms
clapped like buffoons, and blood gleamed off the ‘Divellish idol’. [79] While
it is possible that several women in India were sexually adventurous, and
that there were spaces where norms were transgressed, it is equally likely
that these graphic stereotypes reflect more their writers’ fetishes than a
comprehension of everyday local happenings. [80]

Then, of course, there was the unsavoury presence of ascetics and fakirs.

This class of ‘Ashmen’, so named after the ‘abundance of Ashes with which
they powder their Heads’ and bodies were a ‘very disagreeable and sordid
Aspect’. Both Muslims and Hindus had variants of these, but what was
appalling was sadhus who walked naked; Ovington was horrified that
women spoke freely to these men, unaffected by their nudity. [81] An
eighteenth-century account censures such ‘sanctified Rascals’ who made ‘a
great Shew of Sanctity’ when in reality they revelled in ‘Nastiness and an
holy Obscenity’: One sadhu left a European voyeur transfixed with
revulsion as he flaunted a golden penis-piercing. Many ‘young married
Women’ came to see this holy man, it was added, and ‘taking him [i.e. his
member] devoutly in their Hands, kiss’d him, whilst his bawdy Owner
stroak’d their silly Heads, muttering some filthy Prayers’. [82] Sadhus and
yogis performed austerities that sometimes inspired awe but generally
seemed an embarrassment: In the south, one man saw them worship ‘an
Altar with a Dildo in the middle’—the phallic _lingam_ , a representation of
Siva—offering ‘Rice and Cocoe-Nuts to the Devil.’ [83] In due course, the
British would discover that many of these men were warriors too, who
fought with a ferocity capable of stupefying their enemies, already likely
startled by their abbreviated sense of dress. [84] But on the whole, as with
women and their allegedly unpoliced passions, these ascetics too were
branded pure evil, and India as home to yet more exotic—and revolting—
people. [85]

Finally, local gods and goddesses were no better. One seventeenth-

century missionary related half-baked notions he claimed had local


-----

authority. Siva, he said, as the historian Ines G. Zupanov translates, owned
an enormously long penis, a mark of his limitless desire. But it served a
practical purpose also in that it was used to ‘plough the earth’ and shape
seas, hills and other geological details. His desire, in the meantime, mutated
into a female, attached to his back, and when he said _Om_ (a sacred syllable;
here, misrepresented as the query, ‘Do you desire?’), the woman replied
with _Am_ (‘I desire’). [86] A fellow Jesuit continued the account in which the
lady-on-the-back manages to separate herself so they can copulate, only to
find that Siva’s divine penis is impossibly sized. It was cut, therefore, into
eighteen pieces. Then came the problem that the goddess had no genitals
herself, so Siva had to create it with a finger: From the blood of this vagina
were born planets, the sun, moon and other stars, not to speak of flowers
used in Hindu rituals. [87] Such tales of ‘divine debauchery’, Zupanov points
out, may have been derived from local retellings of mythology (for Puranic
accounts do present gods as possessing carnal instincts) but as usual also
had much to do with the roused fancies of the men relating them. They were
‘part and parcel of the missionary strategies of deriding and ridiculing’, [88]

and succeeded, either way, in sustaining the idea of the irrational, sexually
unfettered heathen, in urgent need of spiritual rescue and Christian
salvation. The West had to save the East not only from its own men and
women, that is, but also sham gods and demonic forces.

From the end of the medieval times, down to the colonial age, then, there

was an information network that duplicated certain clichés about India and
Hindus, helping Europeans construct a self-image of themselves as better. [89]

Certainly there were shrines where human sacrifice was offered, and by all
means, it is likely that women had lovers and killed husbands (in one
eighteenth-century attempt, by crushing glass into dough). [90] But the
elevation of the specific as a timeless standard perpetuated the idea of India
as a savage Other to Christendom; something akin to suggesting that
because Henry VIII had a habit of shedding wives, all Christian kings were
predisposed to depriving their spouses of heads. Even stepping into the
country was fraught with personal, moral and religious peril, which with the


-----

Jesuits was heightened. As we learn, their letters had ‘an unavoidable
tripartite narrative structure’. First, en route to India, they would encounter
turbulent seas, suffer near-death experiences and recall their mortality;
when they reached the subcontinent, its tropical climate came as a shock;
this, then, led to a ‘divine ordeal’ of bodily agony to prepare them for sacred
service in a strange country. [91] Jesuits, after all, trod treacherous roads into
bewildering lands, ‘now through muddy paths, now over innumerable
streams . . . ever haunted by the fear of pagan governors’ threatening
execution. [92] It did not matter that this image sat in contrast with the warm
welcome at Akbar’s court, and, as we shall see, in ‘heathen’ kingdoms too.
For, even if reality were one thing, rhetoric served its own purpose.

As for the Hindus, at first India’s residents could not have cared for what

itinerant Europeans were writing about them, their gods and culture. But as
the white man’s political power grew in the country, his skewed narratives
—and the prejudice these came to represent—acquired the ability to afflict
their world. And so, these would slowly become a threat, till in time Hindus
themselves were forced to answer the question: Who were they, really? If
not devil-worshippers, what was their religion truly about? In a world
where other (unfriendly) cultures could scrutinize their identity, how might
they articulate their self-image? It was in the construction of these answers
that Hinduism took its contemporary, modern form, drawing pride and
confidence from certain aspects of its past and shame from others.

The story of Hindus’ life under Western authority begins in 1498. In May
that year, after many months at sea, a group of half-starved, exhausted
Portuguese sailors landed in Kerala on the Indian coast. It was a momentous
turn in history, these men heralding the dawn of colonialism in the country.
In fact, Europeans stamped the land before even the Mughals—when Vasco
da Gama and his crew arrived, Akbar’s grandfather was still a teenager in
Uzbekistan, decades away from conquering Delhi. Interestingly, after


-----

coming ashore, da Gama and his men found themselves in a temple.
Oblivious that they were doing homage to a goddess—the place was
assumed to be a chapel to Mary—they participated in its rites, accepted
holy ash and dismissed frescoes depicting multi-armed beings with big
teeth as just Christian saints imagined locally. [93] Clearly then, as the
anthropologist Joan-Pau Rubiés observes, not _all_ Europeans instinctively
branded Hindu gods as monsters; where di Varthema would see devils, his
predecessors were willing to visualize the mother of Christ. [94] This has an
explanation. For one, with rumours that Kerala was home to a lost Christian
tribe, da Gama had reason to keep an open mind. But equally, there was
economics: The Portuguese hoped to win special terms of trade from the
local rajah. It was when this did not happen, that things turned bitter. So, by
the time di Varthema was writing a few years later, not only was the king
confirmed as hostile, the Portuguese had narrative incentives in branding
him a devil-worshipper. Politics tinted their gaze, and in the process, the
aforementioned stereotypes came in handy.

Importantly, the Portuguese fixed early on against being just another set

of merchants; ‘from the start [their] effort was based on compulsion and
force, not peaceful competition.’ [95] After all, Portugal’s elite and royalty
were propelling the venture: Unlike traders, incentivized to keep their heads
down, minimize risks and turn profits, these aristocratic backers hoped to
acquire that extra commodity called glory. [96] They had ‘the gun in [their]
hand and’, they were certain, ‘god on [their] side’, all this stemming from a
religious fervour inflecting politics in their own part of the world. [97] It
helped that inland powers in India took little interest in maritime affairs,
allowing the Portuguese to militarize international waters. Armed
aggression in disrupting pre-existing networks also turned them into
predatory extortionists. [98] Soon, toeholds were obtained in Kerala and Goa,
the second a prized possession till the twentieth century. While some coastal
rulers resisted, mainland powers were willing to parley. [99] The Portuguese’s
foreignness was no handicap. In 1505, their envoy to Vijayanagara, south
India’s greatest state, reported that its king had even offered to transmit a


-----

bride for Manuel I, in turn expecting the Christian monarch to reciprocate
by shipping into _his_ harem a sister; this way, ‘the blood of the two royal
houses would mingle’, producing a union. [100] While this did not come to be
—Manuel I probably had reservations about getting in bed with pagans—
the overtly political nature of Portuguese trade meant that it was not long
before religion entered the fray in India too. They had come not to just buy
and sell but to make history—something which would happen in time with
the British also, albeit at a slower pace and greater scale.

With the establishment of a white ruling class in their tracts, the

Portuguese came into everyday contact with Hindus, armed with scarce
knowledge but copious pre-judgement. The encounter took barely a
generation to turn violent. [101] One factor was that the colonizer’s rigid
religiosity had grown stiffer still in reaction to the anti-Catholic
Reformation occurring in Europe. [102] That is, with the emerging Protestant
movement accusing the Catholic church of perverting the faith, Catholic
powers had a special necessity to demonstrate unequivocal Christian
credentials. And here, their newly acquired Indian enclaves offered a parade
ground, packed as they were with devil-worshipping pagans. As early as
1522, a bishop had declared it a ‘mistake to continue to show favour to [i.e.,
tolerate] idolatry’, urging the flattening of temples. [103] Though a shrine was
destroyed in a stray incident, [104] this was not yet policy—the Portuguese
had Indian collaborators and were in no hurry to alienate them. Indeed,
local Hindu elites had aided the Europeans in taking Goa from its previous
(Muslim) masters. [105] They would regret this, though, for no sooner were
their new rulers secure than they proved worse than the last regime. In
1540–41, hundreds of temples were razed, their assets appropriated for
Christian institutions. [106] By the decade’s end, John III (‘John the Pious’)
outlawed Hinduism, commanding that since ‘idolatry is such a big offense
against God . . . I will not tolerate it to exist’; Goa’s idols, ‘in public and in
hiding’, must, he demanded, be crushed. [107] Ecclesiastical authorities
backed this diktat to ‘extinguish the sect of Maphamede and Gentilica

[Hinduism]’, [108] and the Inquisition too—targeting Jews originally—was


-----

imported to India. [109] Rapidly, not only were many Hindus dragooned into
the Catholic faith, [110] there was also an exodus of gods from the area. [111]

As a pattern, this flight of deities was not unprecedented. In previous

times, as Muslim power first washed across the subcontinent, Hindu gods
often went into exile to avoid detection. Many were lost—idols from a
Tamil temple concealed in the fourteenth century were only retrieved in the
twentieth, for example. [112] Between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries,
as Bengali, Mughal and Andhra sultans clashed over power in Orissa, its
most celebrated deity, Jagannath, had to hide repeatedly, for a total of thirty
years. [113] In future too, there would be occasions for deities to disappear:
Under Emperor Aurangzeb (1618–1707), whose iconoclasm still generates
controversy, one particular god was hosted by a chain of Hindu princes in
Rajasthan, birthing the expression, ‘In whose turban does the lord reside?’
114 To be clear, Hindu dynasts seized gods too, and as far back as the
seventh century we see proof of this. [115] Near-contemporaneous with the
Portuguese, a Vijayanagara ruler appropriated gods from neighbouring
lands, thus. [116] And if in 1072 CE , a Tamil shrine was plundered during an
intra-Hindu caste conflict, [117] a Kerala king would act similarly in the
eighteenth century. [118] But Hindu princes tended to _wrest_
119
deities; nonHindu powers threatened their destruction. So, new strategies were
invented: Some gods were hidden behind walls, others in ponds;
occasionally decoy gods were planted to mislead. Why, certain Hindu
deities were secreted away disguised as corpses. [120] One medieval text even
offers a protocol for burying gods, where the priest apologetically states:
‘As long as there is danger, O [lord], please lie down in a bed with the
goddess Earth.’ [121]

Collection.

Something similar transpired in Goa now, as gods looked for sanctuaries

from white tyranny. Temples, after all, were being ‘demolished stone by
stone’, the deities within ‘burnt’, ‘beaten into pulp’ or, if they were metal,
melted for reuse as church objects and chandeliers. [122] So, a goddess from
Chimbel was extracted to Bicholim and deities from Sirula went to
Mulgaon. [123] The Portuguese were not pleased: By the 1580s, they were
attempting to block temple-building in neighbouring lands and to prevent
locals from spending money earned in Goa on banished divinities. [124]

Pointed offence was given: When breaking the temple where Acquaviva
would be murdered, they added to the provocation by slaughtering a cow in
the precincts. [125] As late as 1619, it was recorded—by an anti-Portuguese
observer, admittedly—how priests in Goa had ‘a lot on their hands’ turning


-----

people ‘Christian by force’. [126] Resistance was ruinous. In 1565, thus, when
a padre went to a village, its residents appeared ‘with weapons and loud
shouts’, beating up his aide. In retaliation, seven temples were burned, with
orders issued that ‘none should dare to rebuild them’. [127] In this reign of a
nervous bigotry, local habits too were suspect, ranging from squatting to
urinate to entering homes barefoot. [128] Hindus offered even to pay to
celebrate festivals but to no avail. [129] Like their gods, many fled in the end,
travelling hundreds of miles away, and a number died in the process:
mauled by animals, drowning or because they ran into arms-bearing ‘Jesuit
students’ lying in wait. [130] The irony, of course, as the scholar Alexander
Henn reminds us, is that Catholics were striking at Goa’s idols—and
idolaters—in the same period that Protestants attacked their icons in Europe
under the charge of idolatry. [131] But precisely for this reason, there was no
sympathy; the Portuguese had to demonstrate with fire and blood that they
were authentic Christians. [132] And Hindus suffered in the process. [133]

This Catholic dogmatism, revealingly, however, extended to some brown

Christians too, who were ‘Hindu in culture, Christian in religion, and
Oriental in worship’. [134] Kerala was home to the Nasranis, who claimed
descent from converts left by the apostle St Thomas in 52 CE . [135] They
were, that is, a community which believed itself to have been Christian for
as long as Europe. [136] Our traveller Mattiussi encountered them in the
fourteenth century, foreshadowing in tone the Portuguese when he lamented
how St Thomas’s grave elsewhere in the peninsula was ‘filled with idols’
because of ‘vile and pestilent heretics’. [137] Reference was to the influence
of the Church of the East, deemed dissident by Catholics, on the Nasranis;
Kerala’s Christians received bishops not from Rome but Persia, while
archdeacons were confirmed in their posts by Hindu rajahs. [138] Though
these spiritual heads were held in ‘Reverence both by Christians and
Infidels’, the Portuguese deemed all this adulteration. [139] At first, they
sought to shepherd Nasranis into the Catholic fold through persuasion, but
most of the sheep—who, like Hindus, made cock sacrifices to their saints
140 —had neither heard of the pope, nor were they anxious to discard long-


-----

standing customs. [141] So by the mid-sixteenth century, things grew heated.
As with Goa’s temples, tombs of two Nasrani spiritual heads were allegedly
destroyed. [142] In 1599, after their Persian bishop died, the community was
coerced into accepting Catholic suzerainty. As their new leader promised,
they ‘abjured all the Errors’ of their forebears hereon, saw past guides as
‘cursed Hereticks, that are burning in Hell for their Errors’ and swore
instead ‘Obedience to the Pope as St Peter’s Successor and Christ’s Vicar
on Earth’. [143]

Supervised by Goa, a synod was called. In the Portuguese view, because

Nasranis lived ‘among so many Heathens’ and were ‘subject to Idolatrous
Kings’, it fell to white men to ‘purge out the Heresies and false Doctrines’
debasing their faith. [144] After all, they performed similar rituals as Hindus,
had notions of caste purity, and maintained links with temples—a
syncretism which to Europeans was scandal. [145] Other decrees aimed at
‘literary extirpation’, banning books. [146] For instance, in _The Infancy of Our_
_Saviour_ , Nasranis held that Jesus was a naughty child, went to a Jewish
school and that his father had had a first marriage. These and ‘a thousand
other Fables and Blasphemies’ were cancelled. [147] A list of books was
supplied so they could be ‘corrected, or destroyed’. [148] Catholic positions
and customs—such as requiring celibacy of priests—were imposed; soon,
the Kerala church was subordinated to Goa. But in the end, compulsion had
its limits. In 1653, after the Portuguese ambushed a Persian on his way to
reclaim the Nasranis, many rebelled. [149] One faction declared autonomy,
forged ties with the Patriarch of Antioch in Ottoman Turkey (as opposed to
Rome), threw off the Portuguese yoke and began installing brown
archbishops. [150] It divided Kerala’s Christians but enough in the community
clung to the old ways: The cock sacrifices continued, as did traditions in
which figures like
St George are cast as siblings to fiery goddesses like Kali. [151] Indeed, as late
as 1806, when a local rajah was informed that the British and Nasranis were
of the same faith, he remarked that this ‘could not be the case, else he must


-----

have heard it before’—so different was the ‘native’ Christian from the
European. [152]

In all this, the nascent beginnings of something powerful is visible.

Among Hindus, persecution by an alien race wielding a foreign faith would,
at one level, spark a soul-searching of sorts. It was clear to most in Goa that
what the Portuguese were doing was not merely politics; religion was
enmeshed in it. If the white man’s government was unkind, it stemmed
from a ‘blueprint of imperial thinking’ supplied by a parallel cast of
associates: missionaries. [153] Goa hosted four orders: First came the
Franciscans after its conquest, then the Jesuits, Dominicans, and finally, the
Augustinians by the middle of the sixteenth century. [154] That these fathers
encouraged a hard-line position was clear. In a 1560 conference of Hindu
village heads, thus, we find debate on how the community might respond to
pressures to convert. One speaker suggested exile: ‘It is better to lose our
property than our souls.’ Another urged cautious patience. ‘I do not think,’
he felt, ‘that the fervour of Christianity will last beyond the reign of this
Viceroy’, who was a zealot; Hindus should cling on as best as they could
until someone nicer came to the helm. But the ‘seniormost’ man saw things
clearly. Political agents of the Portuguese crown would trot in and out, but it
was ‘fathers of the Company of Jesus’ who mattered; and these ‘will never
leave or stop making Christians’. This was the reality Goa faced—survival
inside a long-term pressure-cooker, where as a royal letter stated,
missionaries must be valued ‘more than many of the warriors’. [155] In the
old man’s view, the best option, then, was to become Christian—a proposal
accepted by 200 souls from fourteen families. Not wishing to abandon their
homes or surrender social and material privileges, these ‘heathens’ chose to
bend. [156]

And yet, the fact that twenty years later, Acquaviva was brutally

murdered suggests that not _all_ Hindus were prepared to submit to this
‘catechism through fear’. [157] Herein lies the impulse that would mark
political Hinduism. Life in Goa was tough, with employment, political
status and much else made contingent on Christianization. [158] ‘The


-----

Portuguese,’ we read, pressed a transfer of religious loyalties even to
recognize ‘groups within their political body’, and many Hindus acquiesced
if only to gain a plank to reclaim influence or negotiate for better terms. [159]

But those who resisted were resolute too. Besides violence—one of
Acquaviva’s friends in that 1583 massacre was ordered to bow to an idol,
and upon refusal, killed, with his blood smeared on the deity—there were
creative strategies also to bypass the imbalance in power. [160] Parking gods
just miles outside Goa’s limits, for instance, Hindus wooed converts,
encouraging apostasy. [161] Brahmins manufactured rites to _re_ -convert lapsed
Hindus: You could bathe in the sea or wash yourself with Ganga water. [162]

Shrines outside Goa where exiled deities now resided were often grander
than their original seats, in visual defiance of the Portuguese. [163] Within the
region too, Hindus who remained were a problem. They ‘persevere’, a 1580
record tells, ‘in their idolatry and abominable errors’; this despite decades
of state hostility, [164] where the authorities could even invade private homes
at will. [165] Demolished temples were rebuilt and, though fully aware of the
risks, villagers refused to remit taxes in some parts, even conspiring with
enemies of the Portuguese. [166]

In the end, the government relaxed its grip, not least because its policies

had proved bad for business. [167] Besides, the Portuguese never did acquire
the power to translate their edicts into unchallenged reality, especially in
peripheral districts. [168] And, as this shift occurred, old habits of coexistence
reappeared. Many deities returned to Goa, and Catholics and Hindus began
sharing festivals, Christian saints receiving veneration from the latter, [169]

and Hindu goddesses winning Catholic devotees. [170] Local culture, it would
seem, ultimately triumphed over decrees of the foreigner. But for future
Hindu nationalists this was exactly it—Hindus, they would argue, were
naively large-hearted. Alien faiths, on the other hand, with the slightest
power in so small a quarter as Goa, tended towards aggression. Hindus, it
would be lamented, were habitually prepared to forgive the worst horrors;
tolerance on their rivals’ part, however, was based only on practical
calculations. Old patterns, therefore, would no longer do. After all, even if


-----

harmony returned to Goa, the place itself was transformed. In Salcete alone,
in the late sixteenth century, there were 8000 Christian converts against a
population estimated at 80,000. By the eighteenth, however, the numbers
had switched: There were now 1,00,000 Christians and barely 3000 of other
faiths. [171] So, as would be urged in time, the idolaters had to be on their
guard. To prevent old horrors from recurring, they could neither forgive nor
forget. And memories of persecution—and resistance—would one day
supply the raw material for articulating a unified, combative Hinduism; one
aspiring not only to defend itself but of actively going on the offensive.

Within decades of the establishment of Portuguese rule in India,
missionaries who shadowed them realized—despite immense support and
firepower from Goa—that this country was going to prove a challenge.
Typically, when white men in robes set out for the East, it was with a degree
of professional optimism. As Francis Xavier (1506–52) of the founding
class of the Society of Jesus, wrote in 1540, two years _before_ reaching
India, the prevailing sense was that ‘native tribes are very well disposed to
accept the religion of our Lord Jesus Christ’. All that was lacking was
competent preaching, so that an ambition to ‘convert two or three kingdoms
of idolaters’ in a few years was not unreasonable. [172] When he actually
arrived, however, he found the situation dire. To start with, most missionary
activity was limited to the coast (where Portuguese ships offered protection)
and its non-elite classes. In Tamil country, thus, there were thirty villages of
Paravar converted a decade before via another man’s labours. But this was
not because Jesus appealed to this low-ranking group of fishermen, and
boat- and salt-makers. Facing competition from rivals in the pearl-fishing
sector, the Paravar had sought Portuguese security and were claimed
wholesale in a quid pro quo—a commercial rather than spiritual transaction.
When Xavier asked: ‘what more they believed now than when they were
Infidels,’ beyond the appellation of being Christian, they had not a clue. [173]

Journeying with a translator from village to village, the father launched a
valiant effort to impart knowledge to his less than sterling flock, but
apprehensions lingered. And far from converting whole kingdoms, even
communicating to the interested minority was trying, given linguistic and
other limitations.

-----

It is not surprising, then, that shortcuts were employed. On the one hand,

there was fear that converts might relapse into idolatry (bans on drinking
and polygamy were disincentives against sustained faith), [174] but equally,
there was also need to shore up numbers. In a 1545 letter, Xavier announced
how in ‘the space of one month I made Christians of more than ten
thousand’. His method was necessarily dubious. ‘As soon as I arrived in
any heathen village where they had sent for me to give baptism, I gave
orders for all, men, women, and children, to be collected in one place. Then,
beginning with the first elements of the Christian faith, I taught them there
is one God.’ This elementary lesson having been imparted, he would
communicate the sign of the cross and recite a prayer in the local language
(which he would have ‘learned . . . by heart’). Thereafter, he gave them
‘articles of the Creed and the ten Commandments’. When it seemed like the
mass of people were ‘sufficiently instructed to receive baptism’, he
proceeded with the ceremony and wrote ‘each [convert’s new] name on a
ticket’. After a round of destroying idols and bringing in the converts’
families, he bid them goodbye and set off for his next station. [175] ‘In this
way,’ concluded Xavier, ‘I go all round the country’. [176] Indeed, at times he
was unable to use his hands or voice ‘from the fatigue of baptizing’, for ‘in
a single day I have baptized whole villages’. [177] But shallow successes
notwithstanding, the father encountered an obstacle: the hold of a ‘perverse
and wicked set’ of ‘liars and cheats’ known as Brahmins. [178] Or as Xavier
admitted, were it not for these people, India’s pagan masses would easily be
‘embracing the religion of Jesus Christ’. [179]

As it happened, Brahmins were a tantalizing, incomprehensible entity for

Europeans. One early Portuguese writer, despite all the cultural and racial
difference between Hindus and them, had observed that this _specific_ group
among the former shared ideas in common with Christians. [180] For, as the
Portuguese writer Duarte Barbosa added in 1516, at their core, Hindus
offered prayers not to diverse gods (or devils) in idols but one ‘God, whom
they confess and adore as the true God, Creator and maker of all things’.
This was not simple polytheism—if there was a variety of gods in shrines,


-----

these were all ‘under’ a formless great being. [181] Even van Linschoten, after
talking of the usual ‘divilish superstitions’, added how Brahmins believed
‘their [sic] is a supreame God above, which ruleth all things’. [182] This now
created a quandary: The assumption that Hindus were a photocopy of
Europe’s polytheists could not hold. [183] Like former idol-worshippers in the
West, brown people had a list of deities, yes; and yet they _also_
acknowledged a single power. Without irony, their paganism was tethered
to a monotheism. [184] Idolatry itself, in fact, was represented differently by
Brahmins. There were no feared forces inside, the images only representing
god (singular) in various manifestations (as gods, plural). Or as a text
explains: ‘Even if the cow’s entire body were filled with milk, it could
secrete it only through the teat’; images were that divine teat. [185] Nobody
important believed idols were gods; they only _symbolized_ divine power. [186]

For missionaries, this more sophisticated glimpse of Hindu ideas generated
a problem, for they could no longer simply traffic in stereotypes. [187] They
would, instead, have to apply themselves to gathering real knowledge
before they could debunk the Hindu system. [188] Land was easier to conquer;
a conquest of souls warranted more meticulous efforts. And in the process,
Brahmins would become key to missionary imagination—and the principal
defendants for Hinduism, as we shall see in the next chapter. [189]

While this class was met with even in areas under Portuguese control—

so much so that the Goa government too relied on Brahmins for
administrative support [190] —it was in Hindu-ruled territories that Jesuits
clashed with them on more equal terms. The fathers were welcome in
coastal courts, which entertained them partly from curiosity but also out of
fear of Portuguese terror. [191] Thus, about 1600, a Jesuit called Giacomo
Fenicio not only debated Brahmins in Calicut but also prepared a guidebook
on Hindu mythology and its gods. [192] His language, to be clear, was violent,
given how the text was intended for European priests, [193] but it is patent
that the author spent much time cataloguing and digesting the Puranic
tradition—something Xavier neglected, using vitriol to compensate for
ignorance, until giving up on India three years into his stay. Fenicio and his


-----

peers, on the other hand, recognized that the age of blanket dismissal was
over; attacking local gods as devils confirmed European biases but did not
unsettle Hindus or bolster conversion. Knowledge, therefore, was
imperative to spiritual dominance. So, as Akbar’s ulema were baffled when
Jesuits cited the Quran and used it to challenge them on their own turf, the
father in Calicut combined missionary zeal with a command (even if at
times garbled) of Hindu mythology. His objective was transparent. ‘I have,’
Fenicio explained, ‘occupied myself with studying [the Hindus’] religion’,
and not mere superficialities like deities with ‘six faces and twelve hands’.
He had ventured deeper to identify material of more _intellectual_ value, to
help ‘in refuting these Hindus’. [194] In other words, while the goal of
winning converts and smashing idols remained, experience dictated that
mapping the local position, on its own terms, was a critical first step. [195]

Interestingly, as with Acquaviva and his friends at Akbar’s court, Fenicio

also had the freedom to argue his case in Calicut. But as with the Mughals,
its Hindu ruler too was not convinced. For instance, told about
Christianity’s superiority, the rajah asked how Jesus could be divine, when
he was ‘gibbeted on a cross and killed by the Jews?’ [196] And if idolatry
were bad, how come Christians adored images of the Virgin? Was _that_ not
idolatry? This being precisely one of the charges Protestants tossed at
Catholics, the father ‘flung into a passion’ and a ‘vehement peroration’.
Lacking a direct answer, he attacked the deity Krishna instead, a god to
whom even Akbar’s Jesuit friends took exception. [197] According to Puranic
mythology, Krishna was full of mischief. Jesus suffered in his mortal aspect
to atone for mankind’s sins, but what, asked Fenicio, did Krishna do?
Flaunting his research, he dished out a caustic account of the deity’s
exploits: He broke pots and pans, was thrashed by his mother ‘with a churnstaff’, hid the clothes of bathing women and acted in ways unbecoming of
any god. [198] The Hindus’ personalized deity—who could be loved and
chided—was an undignified rogue in Jesuit eyes. Others like Ganapati
defied logic: He had an elephant’s head, a prodigious belly, but somehow
managed to commute on a rat. Even allowing for annoyance, one imagines


-----

the king and his court would have been impressed with Fenicio’s
homework. [199] For the father in turn, while missionary success was slight,
he was able to aid Portuguese strategic interests. He converted the rajah’s
nephew, for instance, concealing the fact so the prince could spy on his
uncle. [200] And as an appalled authority wrote, Goa’s religious leadership,
‘instead of condemning’ the Jesuits for ‘this scandalous dissimulation,
actually confirmed it’. [201]

This overlap between Portuguese political concerns and the missionaries

was a continuation of a culture where there was no ‘distinction between
religion, economics, and politics’. [202] Thus, when the Dutch sailed into
Calicut, it was Fenicio who represented Goa with the rajah, aiming to
thwart Portugal’s rivals. [203] With the Mughals, it was bluntly stated that
Jesuit presence at court was a source of intelligence. [204] This could even
embarrass missionaries: In the 1540s, Goa contemplated an ambitious
voyage to loot the Tirupati temple, which was under protection of the
Vijayanagara emperor. Though ships sailed out, inclement weather aborted
the operation; so instead, they attacked a temple south of the Calicut rajah’s
territories. [205] This, ironically, was done even as Xavier received support
from the province’s Hindu ruler. [206] It did not end double-dealing: in 1615,
there was another Jesuit encouraging the Portuguese in their programme of
intimidation. In his blandly titled _Historia do Malavar_ , Diogo Goncalves
lists the locations of temples in southern Kerala, estimates of their treasure,
resources of the surrounding countryside and offers ideas on how the
Portuguese might attack these places—shrines (and the occasional mosque)
by the beach were close enough to be blown up from ships, for example,
while others would require disembarking. Happily, the father surveyed the
terrain in advance and supplied ideal landing spots. [207] It really did look,
then, as far as the Portuguese were concerned, as if god and the gun went
hand in hand. And Hindu powers noticed this; while Nasrani churches were
acceptable, European ones sometimes found themselves under attack in
Kerala. For they represented not merely faith but also white men’s imperial
presumptions. [208]

As Jesuits moved into the interior, however, further away from

Portuguese arms, these overt connections with politics backfired. In 1598, a
mission went to the new capital of Vijayanagara at Chandragiri. It was
welcomed with an elephant parade and Venkata II, the reigning _raya_
(emperor), gave permission to ‘build a Church, erect Crosses, and convert
men’. [209] Of course, he had his motives: A predecessor had tried and failed
to hammer out a deal for the exclusive supply of warhorses with the
Portuguese. [210] Nor were the fathers innocent of worldly causes—scuttling
overtures from the Dutch would soon become one of their mandates. [211] So
the court flattered the Jesuits, while the latter reciprocated: A European
artist they introduced not only painted Hindu gods but also, apparently, an
erotic picture of Venkata in a pool with women (for which he promptly got
into trouble). [212] As with Akbar and the Calicut rajah, this potentate also
listened to the Jesuits with an open mind: They could assert the falseness of
idol worship without fear, angry Brahmins being silenced. [213] That is, till
Portuguese _political_ excesses tested royal tolerance: Venkata’s warmth
dissipated in 1606 when news arrived of a skirmish between the state’s
authorities and white soldiers on the east coast. Though peace was restored,
the Jesuits were dropped, and in 1610, the emperor transferred his favour to
the Dutch, challenging Portuguese monopoly of the seas. [214] Shortly after,
the fathers departed. [215] By too openly mixing religion with politics, they
had failed their mission. Fresh lessons would need to be learnt—though old
mistakes would in time recur under the British, with painful consequences
again.

In 1577, an Italian couple called Pier and Clarice had a boy they named
Roberto. He was their firstborn, and as such expected to follow in the
military tradition of his paternal ancestors. After all the de Nobilis were—
no pun intended—nobility: They claimed descent from a Holy Roman
Emperor, and Pier personally was decorated for fighting Protestant armies


-----

under the banner of the Vatican. [216] Roberto, however, wished to serve
Rome in a different format: By his teens, he had fixed on becoming a
missionary. His family thought him silly, till the boy simply left one day,
found a patron at a sufficient distance from his relations, finished his
theological education and became a Jesuit. In 1603, he was certified as
ready to serve in the East, and set out for India soon after. It was an
unusually long journey: His vessel was wrecked, and the young man found
himself stranded in Mozambique for months, awaiting further conveyance.
But in the end, he landed in Goa, intact. After preliminary training in Kerala
and on the Tamil coast, he was soon posted to the inland Vijayanagara town
of Madurai. And it was in this great Hindu centre, at the heart of which
towered a grand temple, that de Nobili would expend his life, achieving a
certain celebrity (and to critics, notoriety). Or as a contemporary
proclaimed, ‘Touched by the deplorable blindness of these people . . . filled
with the great notion that Jesus Christ came for the salvation of all men’, de
Nobili threw himself into service. This language was typical, of course, but
Roberto was not, steering clear of the path Xavier and others had paved,
with their aversion towards Hindus. Instead, in what would prove
controversial, he announced: ‘I shall become an Indian to save the Indians.’
217

The Italian was on to something. After decades in India, Catholic

missionaries were grappling with uneasy questions. Without Portuguese
heft would their message appeal to ‘heathens’? Could Hindus be wooed by
methods less stick, more carrot? Experience recommended to some that a
purely evangelical policy, actively distanced from Goa’s politics, was
preferable. Several Jesuits arrived at the conclusion that Hindu culture need
not be condemned; their pitch was spiritual transformation, not cultural or
bodily imitation. It did not matter if people sat on their haunches to urinate,
so long as they accepted Christ. Instead of savaging all they encountered,
the fathers needed to be circumspect; they would have to understand Hindu
culture, and then make their case in forms intelligible to intended converts.
Thus, de Nobili’s older contemporary Thomas Stephens, composed the
_Kristapurana_ (‘Christ Purana’) in a blend of the Marathi and Konkani


-----

languages. Instead of inflicting Latin alone and patronizing lectures, the
man crafted a vehicle for Christian ideas, imitating Hindu devotional
poetry. [218] Indeed, until the Bible was translated a century later, this Purana
remained ‘the closest text available to the complete Bible story in [any]
Indian language’. [219] So too around 1599, one Alesandro Leni, during
preaching excursions, assumed the appearance of a Hindu yogi, divorcing
himself visibly from Jesuit hostility. [220] Or as one of the fathers in Venkata
II’s durbar declared, it was preferable ‘to dress oneself, to eat, and to keep
other social customs’, as Hindus did; to have an impact, missionaries must
match the local image of holy men. [221] So, where Europeans so far clumsily
pushed Eastern concepts into Western moulds—and damned them for not
fitting—they now attempted the reverse, veiling imported spiritual cargo in
‘native’ fabric.

Roberto de Nobili, Wikimedia Commons.

De Nobili would become the most committed advocate of this

inculturative strategy. Madurai had been home to a Jesuit outpost for a
decade, but with little to show; it had not made a single convert, let alone
any of exemplary merit. The problem was clear: Catholics were linked too
closely with the Portuguese, who, to Hindu elites, lacked dignity. The
_Parangi_ (a corruption of ‘Frank’, for Europeans) was pegged with drinking,
rowdiness (thanks to sailors), inferior castes (like the fishermen Xavier
converted), and, rumour had it, eating children fried in butter (for Indians
possessed their own stereotypes about white people). [222] Besides, as another
Jesuit wrote, thanks to Portuguese tyranny, missionaries were viewed not
with ‘opposition’ alone but as a ‘pestilence’. [223] As far back as the 1520s, it
was lamented that even as pious fathers went about sermonizing, their
secular compatriots’ ‘scandalous lifestyle’ punctured the effect. [224] And it


-----

was true that, outside Goa, most converts were of lower caste; a reason why
even the Nasranis hesitated to adopt Catholicism. [225] It was hardly
shocking, then, that when asked if they would entertain the _Parangi_
_Margam_ (‘Parangi faith’) by black-robed fathers, Hindus of status recoiled;
the Jesuits were offering tainted goods. [226] Some, like de Nobili’s colleague
in Madurai plodded on, but the Italian decided on a reinvention. Hindus, he
believed, might welcome the Bible if it looked browner—by which he
meant a specific ‘respectable’ shade of brown. What a future Jesuit called
‘the Dregs of the Populace’ [227] did not interest him, given how they dragged
Catholicism down into a tarnished Parangi-ism. [228] Instead, de Nobili
turned his gaze to the cream of Hindu society. For if _they_ were wooed,
prestige would encase Christianity. [229] It was critical, that is, to aim high
and pluck from the top.

One of de Nobili’s first innovations, therefore, was to discard the

cassock. Instead of expecting Indians to become European in all but
complexion, he embraced _their_ sartorial tastes, dressing hereon like a
_sanyasi_ in saffron robes—the ‘native’ godman’s uniform even today.
_Sanyasam_ , or renunciation, is a normative goal for orthodox Hindus—
assuming the look of an ascetic Brahmin, the Catholic father exalted here an
ideal straight out of Sanskrit textbooks. [230] Where Jesuits stigmatized
everything pagan, de Nobili argued that battling ‘external’ details was a
waste when there was a war of souls to win. All he challenged was religious
aspects of Hinduism, not its social and civil usages. [231] He even restyled the
Christian message—he spoke not of the Parangi Margam but _Satya Vedam_
(‘true religion’), with himself as _tattvabodhakar_ (‘teacher of truth’). By
1610, his Jesuit bosses in Goa learnt that he had acquired a sacred thread,
worn by Brahmins across the torso, and that he no longer ate meat. [232] So
much so that many believed he was preaching a new religion; to locals, he
was no Parangi for they ‘had not heard him pronounce the name of Jesus’.
233 And men were drawn to this indigenized Christianity and its spokesman.
De Nobili even invented new rites: When a Brahmin came on, he cut his old
sacred thread, and gave him a ‘Christian’ one with a cross. Like Hindus,


-----

Madurai’s new Catholics continued to apply sandalwood paste to the
foreheads, and before mass, the father performed puja, or worship as in
temples. [234] Most significantly, he was addressed as _aiya_ (‘sir’, an honorific
typically applied to Brahmins), and everyone thought _he_ was the head of the
church; if the pope showed up in Madurai, his scandalized, more
conventional colleague warned, they would view His Holiness as only a
stray Parangi, not the great governor of the Catholics. [235]

This complainant had good reason to resent the Italian. De Nobili’s

fellow missionary was an older, working-class Portuguese ex-soldier. Soon
after the former’s arrival, he was cast aside. That is, to bolster his claims to
high status, de Nobili invented a veritable caste system between them. After
all, he wrote, ‘I professed to be an Italian Brahmin’; a figure of his august
standing could not mingle on equal terms with a Parangi. [236] He would not
dine with the man, and the latter, if he wished to confer with the Italian, was
compelled to do so in secret. [237] In effect, de Nobili was endorsing the
Hindus’ poor opinion of Jesuits to design a better one for himself; by
discrediting his colleague, he ennobled himself. Naturally, the other father
was glum. De Nobili, in a flash of his own aristocratic origins, also sneered
at his colleague’s lack of education, and played up nationality, hinting that it
was an insecure Portuguese faction raking up trouble. [238] For them, de
Nobili suggested, missionary fervour was subordinate to patriotic loyalty,
whereas Jesuits from lands other than Portugal could separate faith from
political interest. [239] As for being a Brahmin, his colleague’s panic was silly.
It merely meant de Nobili was of ‘an order of learned men’, not that he had
become an idol priest. [240] The sacred thread was a badge of status, not
paganism. ‘Did anyone,’ the Italian demanded, ‘ever pronounce
superstitious the wearing of the golden bulla, the toga bordered with purple,
or the tunic with the broad stripe, which were the distinguishing marks of

[Rome’s] patricians’? [241] No, and the same logic applied here in Madurai.
242 Besides, it was necessary to live sanyasi style ‘for if these people did not
see me do such penance, they would not receive me as one who can teach
them the way to heaven’. [243]


-----

Annoyingly for de Nobili, Goa sided with his disgruntled colleague: It

was not wise to encourage the belief that the Portuguese were a beastly
people. Some flexibility was tolerable—after all, Nasranis who did accept
Catholicism retained Hindu customs despite every pressure from above [244]

—but modification beyond basics was a threat. As Zupanov notes, at a time
when the church had closed ranks to battle the Reformation in Europe, de
Nobili was skating alarmingly close to inventing a brand-new headache. [245]

In 1612, they asked him not to separate his high-caste Christians from those
‘reeking with the stench of fish’ [246] serviced by his partner; that all
Christians must pray together was not negotiable. The Italian obeyed the
letter of the command but violated its spirit by seating converts in separate
rows by caste. [247] Goa was affronted again when on a visit the father took
along a Brahmin cook, declining to sit at their (Parangi) table; he was not
just playing fancy dress but had internalized his argument. [248] And with
good reason: Early on, de Nobili was blackmailed by a Brahmin, who
threatened to expose him as a Parangi in disguise. [249] Naturally, criticism
within the Jesuit order continued about his ‘false and absurd method’, [250]

till in 1619, the Italian was forced to deploy family influence and lobby the
Pope. [251] Now, to the irritation of his adversaries, the Vatican _endorsed_ his
style. It helped that by way of results, the father was vindicated. ‘I long
most keenly to travel about these vast spaces . . . to win their innumerable
peoples for Christ Our Lord,’ he wrote, [252] and by the time of his death in
1656, the Madurai mission commanded the loyalty of thousands. There
were, unfortunately, not many Brahmins, [253] but other high-born groups
were attracted. [254] To his naysayers, then, the Italian Brahmin’s success was
its own answer.

In the broader scheme of things, these happenings in Madurai mark an

astonishing shift from earlier attitudes. In Goa, Jesuits insisted on not just
Christianization but also a Europeanization. Or as one of de Nobili’s
associates explained, ‘The Portuguese try to turn all their converts not only
into true Christians but also into genuine Portuguese.’ [255] Ex-Hindus were
told to discard ‘native’ clothes, customs, habits and even names. No,


-----

vegetarianism was _not_ acceptable; no, local musical instruments may _not_ be
played at weddings. [256] In contrast, here in the Tamil south, as Catholics
operated outside the protection of a Christian state, the reverse occurred:
Converts could retain everything from their past lives, including caste
prejudices, so long as they replaced Hindu gods with Jesus and Mary. In
one Indian writer’s words, it was a case of _murti Christachi, mandira_
_Hinduche:_ placing an idol of Christ in a Hindu temple. [257] So where as late
as 1736 Goa was still attempting to outlaw ‘native’ influences in converts’
lives, [258] Jesuits in the Madurai mission wore loincloths like Hindu ascetics
and ate vegetarian meals off plantain leaves. They absorbed not just broad
norms but specifically Brahmin ones. Indeed, an observer confirmed, the
people did not view them as Parangis at all; and were ‘the Natives to have
the least Notion of this, the Fathers would be obliged to quit the Country’.
259 This inculturation grew so strong that when in 1744 Rome withdrew
support, it was simply too late—Tamil Catholics were not amenable to
European micromanagement. Their faith, while theologically distinct from
that of Hindus, shared a ‘common religious idiom’—it had ensconced itself
into a Hindu terrain. [260] Or as a Protestant critic would sigh, all the ‘silly
observances of Paganism’ with its ‘ghastly superstitions’ had invaded the
papal religion in this corner of India. [261]

Essentially, then, Christianity was altered. The Portuguese attacked

Nasranis for appearing too Hindu; ironically now, their Catholic faith was
succumbing to the same influences. Its greatest proof was the centrality of
caste to ‘native’ Christians. In the 1840s, thus, when a Jesuit went to a
village of Parayars (described once as ‘the refuse of the whole nation’ [262]

for their ritually ‘polluting’ caste status), he kept them standing outside the
church. [263] As late as 2008, low-caste Catholics would complain that they
were still ‘refused the honor of reading scripture, serving at the altar, or
joining the choir’, and endured ‘separate seating’, ‘separate funeral biers’
and demarcated cemeteries. [264] Tamil Christians, like Hindus, had chariot
processions, ‘except that the image of the Virgin’ replaced goddesses. There
was the ‘the same noise of trumpets’, ‘the same blaze of rockets’, and ‘the


-----

same dancers, with . . . marks of sandal-wood and vermilion on their naked
bodies’ as in temples. At the shrine of one of de Nobili’s successors, it was
perfectly Christian to sacrifice goats too, [265] and when another built a new
church, it was with ‘an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the native
dress’. [266] Tellingly, this brand of Christianity was less menacing to Hindu
powers—unlike the Portuguese alternative—and they willingly extended
patronage. [267] In Sarukani near Sivaganga, for example, village revenue
was allocated to a church, described as a _sarvesvara kovil_ (‘temple of the
almighty’). The document was quintessentially Hindu: The grant was to
endure ‘until the extinction of the sun [and] moon’, [268] and it was equal to
sponsoring Brahmins and lighting ‘lamps in one hundred thousand
temples’. To upset it, however, was tantamount to the ‘crime of killing the
sacred black cow’. [269] The sanctity of the cow, that is, was summoned here
to shelter Christian interests.

One wonders whether de Nobili intended to go this far. What he had in

mind was a ‘balancing of much acceptance with some rejection’; he could
never fully endorse Hinduism, for then his own merchandise, Christianity,
would not find buyers. So, his intent was to naturalize himself and his faith
with the people while positioning Jesus as a more refined alternative to
Hinduism. [270] Ultimately, the goal was still to convert. To an extent this
succeeded, but equally, Christian saints simply joined a general cast of gods
and goddesses in these parts. Just as Hindus prayed at the tombs of Muslim
sufis for children, they now also went to shrines to the Virgin. [271] And for
Christians too, a transfer of allegiance to the Bible did not mean a negation
of the past; Tamil Catholics continued to make offerings to village
goddesses. [272] Hinduism did not absorb Christianity as it once had tribal
cults. Meanwhile, the latter, for its part, while staying separate, maintained
a ‘native’ appearance, not posing as pointed a threat as the church in Goa. In

273
fact, by the nineteenth century, Catholics were sometimes called HinduChristians, or as a leading judge preferred, Christian-Hindus.

For future Hindu _nationalists_ , though, there was cause for worry,

nevertheless. On the one hand, it was clear that political power made all the


-----

difference. Goa’s Christianization and demographic transformation, after
all, was a result of Portuguese control of the state. The lesson, then, was that
Hindus must always retain a grip over authority. But the Madurai formula
was no better. Xavier and more aggressive Jesuits were at least honest about
their goals. The Italian, on the other hand, was a ‘conman’. He Hinduized
Christianity, yes, but fundamentally what he ran, they would argue, was a
scam. [274] The irony, of course, is that this strategy—of much acceptance
with some rejection—was how Brahmins too planted their ideas across the
subcontinent over the centuries, synthesizing countless groups and tribes
into the Hindu order. Viewed this way, de Nobili was following an Indian
tradition; the white Brahmin was, inadvertently, enacting the brown one’s
playbook, albeit for a religious system of faraway origins. And in this,
perhaps, lay the recipe of his success—he was doing something quite well
known to Hindus. [275]

In the end, the challenge to Jesuits in India came not so much from Hindus
as Christians of a different denomination. Starting in the eighteenth century,
a fresh crop of missionaries began to trickle into the country—except these
were Protestants. The schism between Catholics and forces of the
Reformation in Europe was institutionalized by now, and charges levelled
by Jesuits against ‘natives’ were seized on by the new entrants to brand
_Catholics_ illegitimate—Protestants accused Catholics of idolatry,
superstition, and of burying the faith under ‘an innumerable multitude of
rites, ceremonies, traditions, and errors’. [276] On the face of it, this has
parallels with Hindu critiques of Jesuits, as we saw with the questions
raised to Fenicio. Indeed, one of the quarrels even between Nasranis and the
Portuguese came from brown Christians’ denial of Catholic images, which
Jesuits argued was heresy. [277] Then there were miracles. Even as they
censured Hindu superstition, Catholic faith in divine interventions was
unquestionable. Xavier claimed a miracle when a lady with prolonged


-----

labour pains delivered after he converted her, [278] and hagiographies show
him bring people back from the dead, now by baptising a drowned child,
and next by applying spittle to a snake bite. [279] The result was that the
fathers themselves gave their Protestant rivals ‘a very good Opportunity of
representing the Jesuits as egregious Liars’. [280] To Jesuits, Hinduism was a
lie; in Protestant eyes, Jesuits were also frauds. In fact, from their
perspective, Catholic complaints against idolatry were a case of pot versus
kettle, a point seemingly confirmed by the ease with the papal faith could be
Hinduized. [281]

Naturally, the Jesuits smelled danger. When the first Protestant fathers

landed nearby, Madurai denounced them as ‘heretics’; when they published
books, subverting Catholic teachings, these were declared as ‘full of errors’.
Amusingly, just as high-caste Hindus claimed that only the worst of their lot
had reason to convert, Jesuits argued that men ‘of the lower strata of
society, some pariahs, enticed by the love of rupees’ alone fell for Protestant
propaganda. [282] And if extremist Hindus even today slander Christians as
‘rice-bag’ converts, eighteenth-century Jesuits insisted that ‘a large number
of neophytes’ had ‘sold their souls’ to Protestants to escape ‘pangs of
hunger’. [283] All along, Indian Christians—demonstrating that ‘natives’ had
their own calculations—exploited the feud: If unhappy with Catholics, they
could transfer allegiances in ‘a truly diabolical treason’. [284] In one case,
after a man shifted to the Protestant camp, there were murderous reprisals
even. [285] So that as a Jesuit warned in 1731, the ‘danger of heresy’ was
constant, and Protestants, ‘intent on the ruin of souls, roam about the fold,
seeking whom they may devour’. [286] It was a dying cry, though, for by the
end of that century, Jesuits would be marginalized in the very evangelical
space they helped create. [287] And by the Victorian age, a British (Protestant)
official would write them off decisively as ‘a perfect scandal to the religion
which they profess’. [288]

It was Protestants who now began to build a following in India,

reinforced not long after by the might of the English East India Company.

And under British rule, Hindus across a much larger geographical expanse
were to find their lives—and religion—under scrutiny and attack.

#### TWO

 ‘HEATHENS’ AND HIDDEN TRUTHS

On 31 January 1708, the son of a German corn merchant stopped at an
unnamed rest house in the Indian peninsula. Armed with lessons from the
Bible, not to speak of good old-fashioned missionary zeal, he found a
captive audience among the children in a school attached to the building.
Who, demanded the European father, was their god? Siva, the startled
Hindu boys replied, only to be notified that this was a horrible lie—no deity
with a wife and issue could be entertained seriously; the _actual_ lord of the
universe was unmarried. Of course, the missionary clarified, this true god
had had a son named Jesus, but there was no spouse, and he advised the
students to ‘be guided and instructed by his holy Laws’ or contemplate
eternal damnation. ‘Our Business,’ replied the children with forgivable
cheek, ‘is to learn to read and write’, and their schoolmaster, at any rate,
never troubled them with such ‘abstruse’ riddles as whose god was real and
whose an imposter. So next, the corn merchant’s son turned on the poor
teacher. It must all have caused a commotion, for in the end, a temple
dancer resting nearby asked the man to take his quarrel to Brahmins, who
might answer his ‘puzzling Questions’—and more to the point, to cease
harassing tired travellers and bewildered little children. [1]

Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg must have made a strange sight in eighteenth-

century Tamil country. For all his magisterial speeches about god, delivered
with force and conviction, he was less tall and imposing, and more round
and ample, [2] saddled also with a stomach ailment that would kill him.
Unlike the Madurai Jesuits who adopted local dress, and despite the heat
and humidity of the south Indian coast, he moved around in a long black
coat, chasing debate and, now and then, manufacturing discord. He once
attended, for instance, the court of a celebrated Muslim mystic, insulting


-----

everybody there by refusing to take off his shoes in the holy presence.
When the old sufi told him that even the local rajah came before him
barefoot, Ziegenbalg declared the mystic too proud and coolly lectured him
on the merits of humility. Predictably, he was not permitted entry the next
time. [3] But such reverses did not dull our man’s avidity. He had, after all,
come all the way from Europe to spread the gospel, braving the worst of
official bureaucracy and mission politics, not to speak of Catholic
resentment. And while he had no desire to become a martyr, he was
determined to see his task through, even if it upset a few crabby ‘natives’
and gave him a reputation as an irritating Protestant.

Ziegenbalg was born in 1682 [4] in Saxony into a middle-class family.

Both his parents died when he was a child, but not before his mother first


-----

pointed him towards the Bible. By his teens, young Bartholomäus had
formed a sincere interest in religion. His studies in Berlin were interrupted
by dismal health, but in 1703, he managed to transfer to Halle to learn from
a highly regarded clergyman. Despite his less than robust constitution, when
intelligence arrived that the king of Denmark was keen to ship Protestant
missionaries to assorted (Catholic-dominated) corners of the world,
Ziegenbalg was nominated with another student. Neither was thrilled at the
prospect of life in Africa as proposed, though, and even failed examination
by a bishop in Copenhagen. But royal will prevailed: In a second appraisal,
the tester quietly modified his prior assessment, endorsing Ziegenbalg and
his colleague, Heinrich Plütschau, as fit for service. An audience with the
king followed, but in an unexpected twist, it was decided that the Germans
should pack their bags for India, not Africa, as missionaries of His Majesty
of Denmark. [5]

Unlike the Portuguese in Goa, however, with whom Catholic

missionaries possessed clout, the Danish East India Company was less than
delighted by the priests who knocked on their doors in 1706. Ziegenbalg
had already got into trouble with his ship’s captain after berating him for
pestering a woman on board. In response, Plütschau and he were restrained
on the vessel for days after arrival, with ‘stale bread and foul water’ for
nourishment. [6] When they finally found a boat to bring them ashore to
Tranquebar on India’s east coast, these first-ever Protestant missionaries in
the land [7] discovered that Company men were unfriendly—their Danish
chaplains disliked Germans, [8] while officials thought all missionaries flies
in the mercantile ointment. After being made to wait an age to see the chief,
they were swiftly abandoned in a street—it was a junior merchant’s
sympathy that helped them find shelter. Official hostility, in fact, would
continue for almost all their time in India: On New Year’s Day in 1707, for
example, when Ziegenbalg sermonized about ‘the sins . . . and the
omissions of Christian Governments’, it was (accurately perhaps)
interpreted as a broadside against the Company. Immediately, he was
accused of ‘inciting to rebellion’. On another occasion, the father spent four


-----

months in confinement after a second slight, imagined or real. [9] No wonder
many missionaries believed they were fighting eternally against the odds,
what with fellow Christians turning spiteful.

Patience, however, was key to winning the souls of strange brown

‘heathens’, misled twice over thanks to papal agents. And lack of support,
while rendering an initial jolt, did not prevent the missionaries from
launching their enterprise. Plütschau was evidently less proactive, with the
result that much of the work was inspired by Ziegenbalg. Given Portuguese
dominance at sea during previous centuries, theirs had become the language
of commerce, ‘spoke here by many Heathens’—this, naturally, had to be
learnt. [10] Alongside also commenced Tamil lessons from a local called
Alagappa (‘Aleppa’), with whom they got along fabulously. Their other
teacher, though, was more of a challenge, for he tended to ‘argueth daily
with us’ about religion. ‘We hope,’ wrote Ziegenbalg, ‘to bring him over to
Christian Knowledge’, while the Indian was bent on taking the white men
to Siva. [11] Either way, by August 1707, Ziegenbalg was confident enough to
preach in the local tongue, [12] though this was a colloquial Tamil, and not its
courtly cousin mastered by de Nobili in the last century. [13] Meanwhile,
sensing that they were ‘more likely to achieve success with children whose
minds were still impressionable’, Plütschau and Ziegenbalg began spending
their meagre resources on a new school, borrowing when they needed more
food and coin. [14] It was an early personification of the idea of mission
education in India: something that would proliferate and leave a greater
impact in the Hindu world than preaching itself. [15]

Neither missionary was prepared for the country, though—in fact, they

knew so little of India that Ziegenbalg believed Tamils to be a ‘truly
barbaric people’. [16] But, unlike with the Jesuits, the opinion evolved rapidly
after interaction. Indeed, soon he was writing of ‘Malabarians’ [17] as
‘generally good natur’d, ingenious, and very industrious’, with the sole,
tragic defect that they were not Christian. [18] Conversations commenced at
once on religion, and Ziegenbalg enjoyed parleying with Hindus. Early in
1707, for example, he met a Brahmin and launched forth on whether Tamils


-----

believed in monotheism. When the visitor confirmed they did indeed
believe in a single, universal power, Ziegenbalg questioned how, then, they
could venerate legions of idol gods. Sure, ‘verbally you own the Existence
of One Supreme Being’, but there were so many subordinate deities that
‘you are at a loss [as] to whom you had best address your Vows or offer
Bloody Sacrifices’. The Brahmin would do better instead, he advised, to
‘break off the Cords of inveterate Errors’ and accept the ‘One only True
God’, who was of Christian outline. Ziegenbalg’s friend, however, did not
take the bait. ‘God has created both Good and Evil; Vice and Vertue;
Happiness and Misery,’ he answered sagely. Nothing could happen outside
his will, so ‘if we . . . are mistaken in point of Religion’, this too was part of
the divine plan. ‘For who are we,’ the Brahmin smiled, ‘to resist the Will of
God’? In other words, even if Hindus had it wrong, it was the almighty’s
considered desire that they should wallow in those wrongs. [19] Christians
might be convinced of their truth; but considering that god chose not to
directly brief Hindus, the latter viewed his self-proclaimed mouthpieces
with courteous indifference. [20]

Next, as Ziegenbalg explained creation, original sin and Jesus’s suffering,

the Brahmin listened with genuine interest but refused to admit that this was
the only way of knowing divinity. ‘I believe all you say of God’s Dealings,’
replied the brown man to the German. But this was how he appeared to
‘you White Europeans’. Among ‘us Black Malabarians’, in contrast, the
supreme being made itself known in other forms. ‘Revelations he made of
himself in this Land are as firmly believ’d here to be true, as you believe
those made in your Country: For as Christ in Europe was made Man; so
here our God Wichtnu [Vishnu] was born among us,’ suggested the
(evidently Vaishnava) Brahmin. Ziegenbalg was by all means free to seek
salvation through the Bible, but his discussant would serve his own god; he
was arguing, in essence, for the idea of tolerance, highlighting that familiar
Indian method of making space for ideological diversity. There was room
for them to agree to disagree, for divine truth was not a one-way street.
After all, finished the Brahmin, ‘to save you one way, and us another, is one
of the Pastimes and Diversions of Almighty God’. [21] Just as different castes


-----

and tribes in India chose from a panoply of sects, deities and styles of
worship—ranging from ascetic renunciation to boisterous, ecstatic bhakti—
Christians were welcome to do what they pleased. But they were expected
to operate within a competitive spiritual marketplace, not attempt to capture
or overturn it.

If Ziegenbalg was startled by this laissez faire attitude to religion, he was

by no means the first to encounter it in India. Only decades before, the
traveller-physician Francois Bernier (1620–88), observing purity rituals
among high-caste Hindus, told a group that their propensity to dip in water
multiple times a day would be deadly in chilly Europe. Clearly, therefore,
such customs could not have been mandated by any universal god, and
were, instead, ‘a system of human invention’. If the doctor meant this as a
blinding display of logic, his Hindu conversationalists were not disarmed.
They reminded the Frenchman that nobody had claimed ‘our law is of
universal application’. On the contrary, ‘God intended it only for us,’ in a
specific context and, presumably, climate. ‘We do not say,’ the Hindus
added, ‘that yours is a false religion; it may be adapted to your wants’
because, in the end, god had ‘appointed many different ways of going to
heaven’. In India, a multiplicity of beliefs was valid, while those of
Europeans made sense in _their_ situations (a principle in line with arguments
made a thousand years ago by pagan intellectuals like Symmachus and
Celsus). [22] Bernier pushed his case but, in the end, departed frustrated. ‘I
found it impossible to convince them that the Christian faith was designed
for the whole earth, and theirs was mere fable and gross fabrication.’ [23] It
was an elementary problem of perception: To Christians, theirs was the only
bona fide Religion; everything else was diabolical pretension or primitive
paganism. That the world might house religions (plural) of varying formats
—and, significantly, that Christianity was _not_ unique—was tough to
swallow even at a conceptual level.

Ziegenbalg was more committed a fighter than Bernier, however. He

went into a ‘Multitude of Heathens’ once, charging them with witchcraft
and honouring satanic images, shunning the true one who ‘breathed into our
Nostrils the Breath of Life’. But he too was disappointed. As with that
Brahmin, those gathered argued that they were placed in these
circumstances by god himself—surely to rectify this was to challenge
divine will? [24] One man asked Ziegenbalg if all Christians had been saved,
that he had come to them: ‘Pray Sir, would you not do better to exert your
Charity first at home’? [25] Elsewhere, people responded with sarcasm, as
occurred when a discussant inquired if he were guaranteed salvation in
Christianity. Because why, he wondered, should he subject himself to the
inconvenience of baptism, when ‘I may be damned in yours, as well as in
my own’ religion? [26] Yet another raised a practical point around diversity
practices in heaven: Were all languages of the world recognized? How did
people of so many races communicate? [27] And when Ziegenbalg sent out a
questionnaire asking why Hindus so disliked Christianity, a respondent
castigated everything from Europeans’ unseemly drinking habits to the
trivia that white folk—in what discomposed a Mughal emperor too [28] —did
not wash their bottoms. [29] Certainly, they agreed, the Bible (and Quran too)
offered ‘the possibility of salvation’. [30] But so did other alternatives. After
all, Hindus themselves had many: One might bow to Siva at dawn, sacrifice
to a goddess at dusk, revere the Vedas and with matching ease seek out sufis
—all while acknowledging that each embodied the same higher principle.

Of course, Ziegenbalg’s tirade against ‘Graven Images’ and ‘Whoring

Gods and Goddesses’ who promoted ‘Uncleanness and filthy Lusts’, [31] did
provoke annoyance also, and a reputation as the ‘Christian Maker of
Tranquebar’ soon preceded him. [32] Once he caused outrage outside a temple
by trotting about on a horse—customarily, even the elite dismounted near
the shrine. Naturally, ‘both Priests and People pealed me with Maledictions
and Abusive words’, while Ziegenbalg used the occasion for an unsolicited
monologue on truth and falsehood. [33] So also when he tried to exit
Tranquebar—leased to the Danish by the Tanjore rajah—he was blocked


-----

from entering the latter’s territory. This prince had reason to suspect
missionaries: Years before, some of his staff had turned Catholic, causing
scandal, and in 1701, complaints reached him of a stage performance that
ended with Christians breaking Hindu images. [34] With Ziegenbalg, the
stated explanation was that ‘ever since you came to these Countries, you are
. . . always scolding at our [temples], blaspheming our Gods, and cursing
our Religious Ceremonies’. [35] While he was not himself taken into custody,
his assistant Alagappa was allegedly imprisoned in Tanjore at one time for
having ‘revealed all the secrets of [Hindu] law and worship’ to the
missionary. [36] Books he printed acquired a notoriety of their own,

37
meanwhile, with Brahmins (and Jesuits) objecting to their virulent antiHindu (and anti-Catholic) tone. So, it was not the case that all ‘natives’
viewed the father with an open mind; some felt seriously attacked, to the
extent that in 1712, a group of Brahmins, finding Ziegenbalg asleep in an
inn, supposedly even toyed with the idea of making his repose permanent.
38 (And we will return, in due course, to the theme of violence in asserting
the Hindu identity.)

Interestingly, while he was exasperating Hindus, the German’s bosses in

Europe were growing restless too. To start with, conversion was weak:
From a servant acquired shortly after Ziegenbalg’s arrival, six years later he
counted only 117 lapsed Hindus. [39] But more worryingly, it seemed like the
father was growing a tad sympathetic towards Hinduism, on an intellectual
plane at least. It began innocently. Or as he reported,

When at last I was entirely able to read their own books, and became aware that the very
same philosophical disciplines as are discussed by scholars in Europe are quite
methodically taught among them . . . I developed a very strong desire to be thoroughly

instructed in their heathenism from their own writings. [40]

Within two years of opening, the Tranquebar mission had gathered 119
Tamil texts. [41] By 1714, Ziegenbalg owned over 600 in a total of fourteen
languages. [42] These manuscripts, wide-ranging in subject, excited him. The
_Tolkappiyam_ , an ancient Tamil grammar, was ‘the greatest book’ but ‘also


-----

the very hardest’; locals, he observed, ‘rack their brains over it just as much
as European philosophers do over the works of Aristotle’. [43] The
_Tirukkural_ , ‘a book of morality in verse’, was most ‘edifying’ [44] —an
opinion shared by an earlier Jesuit, who instinctively speculated that its
writer must have been under Christian influence. [45] The _Sivavakkiyam_
taught ‘good morality’; sadly, its followers, while ridiculing idol worship,
applied the same sentiment to Christianity’s claims of ‘uniqueness’. [46] And,
of course, there was the _Panchatantra_ , ‘similar to Aesop’s Fables’ and
‘much used in schools’. [47]

In fact, amassing more literature than converts, the father would slowly

dismantle part of his own prejudice. Or put another way, Ziegenbalg slid
from learning ‘ _about_ India’ to proposing that perhaps there was something
to pick up ‘ _from_ India’. [48] That ‘natives’ were a thinking people, not fools
flitting around malicious devils, also became clear through an
‘interreligious dialogue’ with Hindus. [49] Conducted through letters, it
offered a variety of insights. To ‘purify’ their insides, one respondent stated,
yogis had mastered the art of sucking water up the anus. [50] But more
serious data too was received. There were, Ziegenbalg learnt, four
Vaishnava sects and three pledged to Siva in these parts. But, his ‘native’
correspondent added, where ‘religion is concerned, there is only one’: an
assertion of Hinduism’s singularity; of that Brahminical consciousness
discussed in this book’s opening. [51] Equally, however, a second man
grumbled that this feeling was not concrete, leaving Hindus fragmented in
_real_ terms—and susceptible to missionaries. [52] Monotheistic ideas were
present, but without consensus: One writer pronounced god formless and
beyond description; [53] another painted a verbal picture of Siva, giving
divinity a shape. [54] Invariably, certain thinkers sought to defend Hinduism,
knowing well Ziegenbalg’s professional intent. Yes, some Hindu customs
were regrettable, they agreed, but this hardly justified an assault on the
entire religious architecture. For ‘[w]ere we to judge the Christian religion
by the deeds of [some] Europeans, we [too] would hardly find any good in
it’. [55] In fact, these interlocutors redefined missionary concepts. White men


-----

divided the world between Christians and heathens; to Hindus, on the other
hand, heathens were those ‘who live contrary to God’, with bad habits and
morals. And these existed in _all_ religions. [56] Good did not reside
exclusively with Christians, that is, apportioning bad alone to others; every
culture held both in fractions. [57]

Despite his missionary urges, Ziegenbalg was fascinated. And so, like

many before and after, he produced a book. Except that this upset his
European superiors. For the _Genealogy of the South-Indian Gods_ (1713)
was a manual of Hindu deities, ranging from _gramadevata_ s (village gods)
who commanded ‘devils’ to grander powers such as Siva and Vishnu. On
the face of it, it was an outsider’s effort to grasp the layered, seemingly
tangled mythologies of Hindu gods, structuring them into a family tree from
the almighty. [58] Though offered—in keeping with most missionary
productions—as a digest to arm future Christians for spiritual crusades in
India, what is telling is the _Genealogy’s_ submission that Hindu thought had
value. Admittedly, Ziegenbalg was not the first to suggest this: de Nobili,
for instance, took a similar stance. Yes, he wrote, there was idol worship
and ‘fictitious tales’. [59] But buried within were parallels with Christian
teachings. [60] Or more memorably, even if much ‘reek[ed] of the dung pit’,
Hinduism had ‘pearls’ [61] by which white men too ‘could benefit’. [62]

Ziegenbalg agreed: As early as the year of his arrival, he argued against
condemning all Hindus as demon-worshippers given how enough of them,
it was patent, venerated the ‘one Divine Being’. [63] Now in the _Genealogy_ ,
he travelled further, adding that under a seeming pandemonium, ‘these
heathens still possess of traditions out of the Word of God’. [64] Christians
had no monopoly on divine truths, that is; Hindus had means of accessing
them as well, even if by ‘the subtility of the devil’ things were ‘perverted
and distorted’ here. [65] While not equal to Christians, these people were yet
not, the father felt, _as_ awful in matters of faith as made out in European
imagination.

It was a mature view. But at home, the church was looking neither for

nuance nor a research paper on pagan theology. And so, when his thesis


-----

arrived in the post, it was denied publication. Missionaries, the German was
warned, were sent out ‘to extirpate heathenism’, not ‘to spread heathenish
non-sense in Europe’. [66] ‘Natives’ might uphold the preposterous idea of
multiple paths, but the father had to remember there was only one street; he
had no business legitimizing Eastern errors. Ziegenbalg’s subtle suggestion
—that Christians had no new message to deliver, and that Hindus had
_within_ their traditions, strands aligned with the best of Biblical teachings—
was a dangerous line. So much so that he himself appears to have applied
for anticipatory bail in the book’s preface. The _Genealogy_ concerned itself,
he loudly explained, with much ‘heathen foolishness’. Writing the book was
no ‘delight’, only ‘punishment and [a] nuisance’. [67] That is, he deprecated
his own work—and with good reason given the response it provoked. In
any case, the manuscript was promptly shelved. [68] Missionaries, Ziegenbalg
learnt, had better stick to prescribed goals, armoured in dogma; to allow
pagan ideas to spark self-doubt was unwise. And if knowledge of local
thinking were acquired, this must be deployed only—as we saw in previous
cases—to ridicule their source, not reflect on Christianity and its limits.
Indeed, after 1714, a chastened Ziegenbalg would largely cease writing on
and studying Hinduism; he had strayed too far from the dictated path. [69]

Unfortunately, this did not end his woes. Plütschau had returned to

Europe in 1711, leaving Ziegenbalg to carry on alone, and indeed die in
Tranquebar eight years later. He did himself travel home once, marrying on
this trip; if no German came out to India, he warned, he would seal the deal
with a Tamil. [70] It was not, as such, a happy union: Two of three children
born to the couple died, one in Ziegenbalg’s lifetime, and there were many
pressures born of financial constraints. His health too declined—for that
long running stomach ailment, he was prescribed ‘a steel cure which
involved having to drink an infusion of iron files in water’. [71] To this ordeal
was added stress from conflicts with higher-ups who never understood why
a missionary needed money. His job, as they pictured it, was to live
frugally, wandering about preaching to ‘heathens’. Ziegenbalg, however,
having encountered a rather more sophisticated society, pressed for funds to


-----

support his school, horses, buildings and to develop human resources. In
February 1719, the father died a clearly harassed figure, and not long after,
a ‘bulky communication’ arrived from Copenhagen with ‘a complete
condemnation’ of his work. When a colleague opened it, he was ‘scarcely
able to read it for tears’. [72] Ziegenbalg had been sent out on a mission; by
getting distracted, by ceasing to cork his mind from local influences and by
telling his bosses what they did not wish to hear, he had ended up a failure.

In the story of modern Hinduism and its political awakening, however,

Ziegenbalg had chanced on something powerful. A century after his death,
when India came under colonial rule and prolonged evangelical stress,
Hindus would again be rebuked for the ‘wrongs’ in their religion. Accused
of practising a barbaric faith, they would be offered redemption in
Christianity and European civilization. Given how white men had seized the
land, making their prowess all too obvious, responding to these claims was
not easy. It was no longer the case that a few passing missionaries were, by
turns, amusing and irritating Hindus; having lost power, the latter now lived
under Christian authority. Men of Ziegenbalg’s vocation posed an even
graver threat in these new conditions. And so, resistance was inevitable. But
what is interesting is that in devising a response, many Hindus would take
the same position as their priors who interacted with our eighteenth-century
father. Sure, there were ‘bad’ features in their religion. However, offsetting
these were enough that satisfied even Western parameters of ‘good’.
Popular, ‘lower’ Hinduism—visibly polytheistic and idolatrous—might,
from the European perspective, deserve contempt. However, its ‘higher’
constructs could hold their own. Hindus, then, had no reason to convert,
except in the sense of giving up ‘embarrassing’ traditions to underscore
‘better’ ones—an inner reorientation as opposed to a complete desertion. In
doing so, they would partly also internalize a foreign gaze, of course. But
under colonial domination, this was inescapable; this was a stung, defensive
society, acting under a series of shocks and strains. [73]

Either way, the message foreshadowing the rise of modern Hinduism was

this: White men might corner power in India. Where religion and identity


-----

were concerned, though, ‘natives’ could—and would—stubbornly continue
to refuse instruction.

The proposition that Hinduism had higher and lower forms—the first
resembling monotheism, the other ‘messily’ polytheistic—was neither new
nor a European bifurcation. [74] In one Vedic text, thus, a sage is asked how
many gods exist. He opens with 3306. But when pressed as to how many
_really_ exist, his answer changes: The number is pruned to thirty-three, then
six, two, one and a half, and finally one. [75] A 1380 inscription makes a
corresponding claim: God was the one Saivas worshipped as Siva, some
philosophers in the abstract, others through ritual and Buddhists as the
enlightened one. [76] Even masters of bhakti stressed this; as Purandara Dasa
sang in the 1500s, ‘“My God”, “Your God”, don’t talk like that. There is
only one God.’ Muslim observers took note early on: An eleventhcentury writer recorded that idols served the less-evolved by offering a [77]
physical anchor, but educated Hindus dwelt on a metaphysical god. [78]

Among these latter, enough viewed popular practice with condescension
even. [79] Just as girls played with dolls until mature enough for domestic
life, a spiritual patriarch said to a Mughal prince, those ‘unaware of the
interior’ fiddled with outer forms. [80] The gap with monotheisms elsewhere,
however, is evident: In the West, principle and practice (largely) coincided.
There was one god to whom prayers were addressed. [81] In India, though,
the principle sat atop a polytheistic infrastructure: God was one but worship
was directed at many deities, [82] drawn from a variety of cults, a few even
competing for recognition as _the_ god. [83] In fact, one of Ziegenbalg’s
informants argued that in time, all these would be ‘transformed into the one
divine Supreme Being who alone will then be God’. [84]

In this multi-tiered system, there were gradations of orthodoxy.

Philosophers and ascetics looked down on all forms of worship, irrespective


-----

of whether it celebrated mega beings like Vishnu or the village goddess of
smallpox. Others discriminated differently; some of Ziegenbalg’s contacts
adored higher gods but decried the lower. Only the ‘humble of the lowest
castes’ were fond of inferior deities, one said. [85] Another called them
‘devils’, to whom people made sacrifices from fear. [86] That is, where
Christians demonized _all_ Hindu deities, _some_ Hindus branded _some_ gods
‘false’ in matching terms. [87] Similarly, though Indians used images, this had
come largely from outside the Vedic tradition; not all Brahmins, therefore,
approved. [88] The most self-consciously ‘authentic’ among them eschewed
temple service; priesthood was degrading. [89] Indeed, some thought laying
eyes on temple-priests defiling, [90] and a key text equates them to butchers.
91 Yet, these voices were a minority; as noted, Puranic Hinduism, crossfertilized by so many sources, never had just one response to things. So,
despite naysayers, most Brahmins adapted. [92] Priests, facing purist disdain,
retorted that ‘the mere sight of the image of god was worth _more_ than’
prescriptions of the conservative. [93] But either way, in what would serve
‘natives’ well, their religious archive presented so many possibilities and
interpretations that resources for every contingency were available. [94] If
Europeans propped up monotheism, Hindus could sing along, even assert
ownership, despite the surfeit of gods populating general imagination. If
idolatry were rubbished, ‘native’ thinkers could nod in assent,
simultaneously showing indulgence. White men saw in this hypocrisy and
trickery, but to Hindus, this was entirely in keeping with their manystoreyed history and plural personalities.

It was Brahmins who typically provided narrative coherence for this

diversity of thought and action, tailoring answers to the askers’
expectations. [95] Unsurprisingly, they were showcased as the best candidates
to explain Hinduism. This centrality of the Brahmin was widely admitted. [96]

Even with Ziegenbalg, more than one Hindu interlocutor clarified that his
inputs sprang from the correct sources—by which he meant Brahmin
scholars. One writer apologized for a lag in correspondence; thanks to
turbulent weather, the ‘Piramanarkal’ (Brahmins) had been staying home. [97]


-----

Another supplied information himself but felt it necessary to add the
disclaimer that he had _not_ asked Brahmins. [98] Indeed, dialogue with
Brahmins opened up a less unkind view of Hinduism among some
missionaries. Before our German, in 1651, for example, a book titled _The_
_Open Door to Hitherto Concealed Heathenism_ made its appearance in
Europe. Described as the most ‘capacious’ study of Hinduism until then, [99]

it was also an attempt to make sense of Hindu life from the inside. [100]

European writing, as we know, often built on the strange and scandalous:
externalities that highlighted ‘monstrosity’ to confirm Western superiority.
Widow-burning, ‘obscene’ antics by nude sadhus and devils in temples, fit
with ease negative categories already available to the Christian world. [101]

But then, Jesuits like de Nobili triggered a crisis by showing how not all
Hindu customs were outlandish and that the West ‘could not command
universal admiration’. [102] Now with _The_ _Open Door_ , Abraham Rogerius
(1609–49) in Pulicat—granted the Dutch by Venkata II—went a notch
further, enabled by his willingness to wed observation to ‘native’ guidance.
103 For helping the Dutchman comprehend Hindu culture was a Portuguesespeaking Brahmin fugitive from Goa (!) named Padmanabha.

This unlikely collaborator’s antecedents notwithstanding, the result was a

far more nuanced account of Hindu life. Gone were idols with cock’s feet
and fleshhook arms; instead, Rogerius soberly recorded that Vishnu was
depicted with four arms, while Siva was cast as a lingam or as a man with
‘two [eyes] in the natural place, and the third in the middle of the forehead’.
104 Practices like sati were noted but without shrillness: Families with
accentuated notions of prestige might pressure widows to burn, but doing so
was ‘a crime that merits hell’. [105] There were festivals with chariot
processions, but nobody in _The_ _Open Door_ rushes madly to throw
themselves under wheels. So also the father formed an understanding of the
country’s sacred geography: The greater Tamil pilgrimage centres were at
Srirangam, Madurai, Tirupati, Kanchipuram, etc., while the subcontinental
map included shrines far in the north and west. [106] Indeed, Rogerius
recognized Hinduism as a spectrum, including differences between the


-----

Brahminical orthodoxy and mass religion. Describing buffalo sacrifices, for
example, he recorded how Brahmins abhorred these but ‘dare not oppose
it’. [107] Sectarian intricacies too were identified; Brahmins were not a
uniform bloc—there were Vaishnavas (who projected Vishnu as supreme),
Saivas (who argued for Siva), Saktas (for whom god was a goddess) and
Smartas (who acknowledged all three and more as forms of divinity). [108]

Subtler elements were not missed either, such as the ‘ingenious’ Puranic
formula of linking temples to the great narrative via stories. [109] Why, the
father grasped even caste in its insidious complexity: Parayars, he reported,
were treated with contempt. And yet, with a group even lower, they _too_
showed cruelty. [110] This was a society split into many parts vertically and
sideways both: a source also of its religious heterogeneity. [111]

In other words, as missionaries began to listen—if grudgingly only—to

‘native’ voices, even popular Hinduism looked less shocking. In the realm


-----

of ideas, meanwhile, a sense dawned that aspects of Hindu philosophy
passed muster even against a Christian lens—something that in colonial
times Hindus would, as we will see, turn to their advantage. Before
Ziegenbalg, the Portuguese missionary John de Britto (1647–93), thus,
concluded that ‘natives’ were not altogether hopeless. Because, ‘[s]uch as
reflect seriously on the principal points of [their] doctrine . . . will soon be
of opinion, that these idolaters were formerly acquainted with the mysteries
of the christian [sic] religion’. [112] That is, buried under all species of
difference was something relatable. So, if Francis Xavier reproached
everything Hindu, better exposure now indicated that the system held its
own logic, explaining also why Hindus felt little appetite for conversion. To
be clear, Europeans still refused to admit parity between Hinduism and
Christianity, given the rest of its ‘idolatrous’ baggage. For as de Nobili
wrote, ‘milk mixed with poison’ still killed. [113] Nor was conversion
abandoned. Yet, its method was reframed. Sure, some were willing to
whisper, Hinduism was _perhaps_ a step on god’s ladder. But it was a poor,
ramshackle one. The Bible, meanwhile, towered above. Conversion, that is,
was positioned not as a choice between falsehood and truth—which failed
on Hindus, with their infuriating relativism—but as a road to all milk, zero
poison. Just as there were higher and lower paths within Hinduism,
Christianity ranked above ‘native’ religion. And so, some hereon sought to
persuade Hindus that their faith was adulterated; that for pure dairy, Jesus
was the outlet. Or to quote our Italian Brahmin, Hinduism was like
‘fragrant’ balm in a ‘dirty pot’. If they wanted the same item in its fitting
receptacle, they must come to Christianity. [114]

By the eighteenth century, then, the attitude towards Hindus became a

welter of contradictory feelings, ranging from violent opposition to
compromise. While devil-talk continued, awareness emerged that what
looked, at a glance, so certain to Western eyes was a pixelated image. But
even as missionaries recalibrated, a fresh crop of men were watching.
Europe, after all, was going through its own upheavals. The Protestant
Reformation, combined with dynamics set off by the Renaissance, had led


-----

to a so-called Age of Enlightenment. [115] The grip of dogma slipped, and the
‘discovery’ of new countries sparked curiosity about its peoples and beliefs.
Imperiling the church, murmurs arose that Christianity might not have all
the answers—and, indeed, that there were religions (plural) in the world.
And just as Protestants employed arguments against idolatry to discredit
Catholics, Western rationalists, sceptics and scientists now calculated that
Hindu philosophy might smash the orthodoxy in Europe. The Hindu
scheme of time alone— _yuga_ s, each lasting many millennia—cast doubt on
Biblical claims that the world was under 10,000 years old, for instance. So,
a reading of Hinduism, intended to buttress European preoccupations,
gained intellectual currency. And just as de Nobili made his religion
palatable to Hindus by stripping it of Western cultural accoutrements, Hindu
ideas—cut from ‘native’ moorings—acquired a dim, functional legitimacy
in European eyes. A quest would begin for ‘authentic’ Hinduism, separated
from its complicated living culture. The latter was confusing; the former
Westerners might understand, and indeed, even exploit for their own
purposes.

Europe too, that is, was discovering ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ Hinduism. And

in isolating the first, and seeking monotheism _outside_ the Christian
tradition, it would soon fix its attention on the Brahmins’ most hallowed
literature: the Vedas.

Portrait of Prince Dara Shukoh, Golconda painting (1686), from the Witsen Album, courtesy of the

Rijksmuseum.

In September 1659, a great grandson of Emperor Akbar was paraded
through the streets of Delhi. The people of the city were out in full force to
see this prince, who was, undoubtedly, among the most extraordinary
products of his dynasty. There were men at arms, and a great many others in
attendance on forty-four-year-old Dara Shukoh. And yet, something was
amiss. The crowd was restless and in tears. The prince himself was not in
court attire but dirty rags. Where not long ago he owned ‘pompously
caparisoned’ elephants, now he rode a ‘miserable’ beast, ‘covered with
filth’. [116] For what was underway was not a conventional state procession
and the Dara the townsfolk saw no more the figure who lorded over his
father’s high council. This was, instead, a spectacle of defeat: The prince


-----

had lost the war of succession to his brother, Aurangzeb, who now sat on
the Peacock Throne. Transfers of power with the Mughals tended, of
course, to be bloody, contenders being blinded or poisoned, leaving no
threats to whoever took the crown. But in _this_ fratricidal war, the loser
enjoyed much sympathy, so visible that day in the public’s lamentations.
Not long after that wretched elephant ride, therefore, a paranoid Aurangzeb
would have Dara executed. But he also felt it necessary to justify this
murder. Posing as a champion of faith, the new padshah claimed merely to
be doing his duty; in destroying his sibling, he was only ‘pluck[ing] out the
thorn of apostasy’ from the ‘rose-garden’ of Islam. [117] Decades later, a
chronicler was more explicit in cataloguing Dara’s sins. He had ‘developed
an inclination for the religion of the Hindus’; grown too fond of Brahmins;
and worse, he declared their sacred books—the Vedas—to be the ‘word of
God revealed in heaven’. [118]

It was an exaggeration, for Aurangzeb was really after power and would

have appropriated the nearest pretext to pulverize his brother. Yet, it was
also true that Dara was reviewing Brahmin scripture. [119] In the same period
when Catholic missionaries were coming around to guardedly studying
Hinduism, as opposed to censuring it outright, the Muslim prince had been
engrossed in his own intellectual exploits. These were varied: There was
poetry, discussions featuring sufis, sanyasis and likely a Jesuit, [120] and a
passion for books and critical inquiry. One of his writings, for instance,
begins with the naughty line: ‘Paradise is where no mullas are found.’ [121]

But even as he longed for a cleric-free society, Dara still believed in god. In
fact, before succession politics abridged his life, he had been trying to find
the world’s original fount of monotheism. For with so many religions on
offer—and several holy books claiming heavenly descent—divinity’s first
word surely existed somewhere. Identifying a Quranic line, which seemed
to speak of a hidden book, Dara decided to locate it. And find it he did, with
India’s Brahmins and their Vedas. Many, of course, had known that
Brahmins believed in one supreme being; now Dara crowned them
custodians of that being’s pristine wisdom as well. Recruiting scholars,


-----

dozens of Vedic manuscripts were examined and portions from the section
known as the Upanishads translated into Persian. This ‘distillation’, the
prince proclaimed on the project’s conclusion, carried that elusive
substance: ‘pure, original monotheism’. [122] It was all very electrifying—
until his enemies labelled the exercise heretical, that is, and made it a
warrant for severing his head. [123]

With Europeans, the Vedas first entered consciousness when Dara’s great

grandfather was still an infant in the sixteenth century. Xavier had, in
passing, mentioned a Brahmin who claimed that Hindus possessed the ‘laws
of God’, preserved in ‘books of sacred literature’. [124] But with his
trademark contempt for all things pagan, our Jesuit showed no curiosity. It
would take till the 1580s for a man called Agostinho de Azevedo to register
more data: Brahmin scripture, he reported, included four Vedas, six Sastras,
eighteen Puranas and twenty-eight Agamas. [125] When plagiarized in 1612
by Diogo do Couto, this (Saiva) outline of the Sanskrit corpus became more
widely known. [126] Around the same period, in Kerala, Diogo Goncalves
mentioned three Vedas in a report, but it was only with the 1651 arrival of
Rogerius’s _The_ _Open Door_ that their names appeared in print:
Roggowedam (Rig Veda), Issourewedam (Yajur Veda), Samawedam (Sama
Veda) and Adderawanawedam (Atharva Veda). [127] Meanwhile, de Nobili
had already examined their contents: a not insignificant moment, for the
Vedas were referred to in Tamil as _Marai_ , or ‘hidden’ truths. [128] Luckily,
one of the Italian’s Brahmin converts quelled his scruples and un-hid the
texts for him. But it was an anticlimax: The material seemed a ‘disorderly
congeries of various opinions’ and a ‘jumble where religious and civil
precepts’ were mixed up. Besides, it too featured multiple deities, not pure
monotheism. [129] Nevertheless, de Nobili conceded that Hindus knew
something of god in the same manner as Christians. [130] And that was that.
In fact, a whole century later, Ziegenbalg, dismissing the Vedas as ‘small
books of law’, drew most of his knowledge from other Tamil manuscripts.
131 One could learn everything about Hinduism even without these
mysterious Sanskrit sources, whose value, to him, looked doubtful. [132]


-----

By the time the Vedas physically reached Europe, then, more years would

pass. It was French Jesuits who delivered manuscripts of ‘irrefragable
authority’ to Paris. Writing in 1733, Jean Calmette (1693–1740) noted how
difficult these were to obtain: Those Brahmins who had them would not
sell, [133] and given how they didn’t show these even to other Hindus, what
were the chances foreigners could apply to borrow? In fact, missionaries
were resoundingly scammed—one father parted with princely sums only to
find himself encumbered with a pile of ancient-looking nonsense. [134]

Bernier too complained that despite persistence, he was unable to obtain the
Vedas even in Benares, the Hindus’ holiest city. [135] While some thought the
texts inaccessible due to Brahmin jealousy, most Brahmins also, in fact,
lacked copies. [136] Ziegenbalg went to the extent of doubting the Vedas’ very
existence. Yes, his disputants were ‘always speaking’ of this ‘Law, which
you call God’s Word’. But he was forced to propose that ‘you have no such
Law’ because nobody ever produced it. [137] A less scathing writer ascribed
this to other causes: Even Brahmins who held the material were ill equipped
to decode it, the Sanskrit being archaic. Besides, to really comprehend
meaning one required the aid of commentaries. [138] In the end, subterfuge
was resorted to. The French fathers had a secret Brahmin convert who
smuggled in the Vedas in the Telugu script. [139] And Calmette was elated,
not from a scholarly spark, but because he believed these books offered
missionaries ‘weapons’. In other words, strains in Vedic thought that
elevated monotheism could be used _against_ Hindus; to best those Brahmins
defending extant, idolatrous Hinduism, missionaries could brandish brown
men’s own conflicting ancestral Sanskrit writings. [140]

It is ironic that an eighteenth-century Catholic was so anxious to assault

Hinduism by stressing the cleavage between scriptural recommendations
and actual practice. For this was exactly how the Roman church was
assailed by Protestants from the sixteenth century onwards. One of the most
stinging charges against Catholicism by Martin Luther had been that it
screened off the Bible—in obscure Latin, with translations into vernaculars
barred—from the masses. Ordinary Christians were fobbed off with the


-----

worship of saints, colourful processions and a camouflaged idolatry, while
god’s message circulated among the clerical few. Besides, for all its
pretensions to holiness, even the text preserved by Rome was full of errors;
in adjudicating the meaning and texture of every concept, the Catholic
church had _corrupted_ god’s word. [141] One zealot went so far as to equate
Catholics with Muslims in wickedness. [142] All the church really cared
about, it was alleged, was preserving its institutional dominance. For
Protestants, however, fidelity to god’s (original, literal) word ranked higher
than allegiance to a venal establishment. Which meant free access to the
Bible by ‘the mother in the house, the children in the street, [and] the
common man in the market’ in their own tongues. [143] Everything else was
superfluous. Indeed, as Protestantism convulsed Europe, ‘[r]ood lofts were
dismantled [in churches], elaborately wrought screens defaced, niches
which had once housed statues were bricked in, [and] altars removed’. [144]

Even murals depicting saints were painted over—because, to quote another
critic, ‘The BIBLE . . . the BIBLE only’ was the true Christian religion. [145]

All other cultural accretions were man-made, and hence, distracting and
impure. Understandably, Catholics were furious, the two groups routinely
accusing each other hereon of everything from sodomy to blasphemy.

In India, however, Christians of both denominations were united in

attacking Brahmins along similar lines. [146] As far back as the 1540s, Xavier
stamped this class ‘evil to the very backbone’. Why? Because despite
knowing there ‘exists one God’, they kept it ‘secret’—a suspicion aired in
Islamic courts too, which struggled to understand how Hindus could
reconcile monotheistic ideas with its reverse in practice. [147] Ziegenbalg,
similarly, disparaged Brahmins for persisting in idolatry even on
recognizing the ‘Falseness of [such] Gods’. [148] As for the Vedas, if they
were _really_ god’s message, why hesitate to reveal them? [149] The answer
could only be that either the books were rubbish or that Brahmin
exceptionalism and control depended on a monopoly—much like the
Catholic clergy. It helped that critiques of what Europeans termed
‘priestcraft’ existed locally also. Some of Ziegenbalg’s informants, for


-----

example, accused Brahmins of telling ‘lies’, adding that Hindus could not
filter truth from falsehood due to unfamiliarity with their texts. If at all
fragments were revealed, it was to serve Brahmin interests only. [150] A
thirteenth-century scholar, similarly, called the Vedas ‘niggardly’ for
keeping their ‘treasures’ cloaked. [151] And Brahmin writers tangentially
acknowledged the risks involved, including of losing followers to rivals. As
the tenth-century _Nyayasara_ of Bhasarvajna puts it: Some Sudras—the
lowest of the four caste-categories—when denied access to the Vedas, were
won over by Jains, who freely peddled _their_ texts. [152] So, in future, under
colonial rule, while there was a so-called Protestantization of Hinduism,
with an almost laboured intellectual emphasis on scripture above custom—
and the enthroning of ‘higher’, philosophical Hinduism as more legitimate
than the ‘lower’—the fact is that arguments in favour could be deduced
from _within_ the tradition also. Hindus already possessed the impulse, that is,
which would grow in a disproportionate spurt under Western influence. [153]

Paradoxically, meanwhile, the Vedas also appealed to the European

enemies of Christianity. This was linked to an intellectual climate long in
the making. By the mid-eighteenth century, a constituency had emerged in
the West challenging religious orthodoxy. Post-Renaissance advances in
science were a contributing factor alongside the Protestant levelling of the
Catholic church’s infallibility. Some at first attempted to align scientific
knowledge with the Bible; a naturalist, for example, recommended that the
line ‘In the beginning God created heaven and earth’ be read as ‘In the
beginning god created _the matter_ of heaven and the earth.’ [154] Others,
however, proved outright sceptics. After all, even the ancients had had
doubts about Biblical content. If god made all animals for humanity’s sake,
for instance, what led to the inclusion of crocodiles and snakes in his
inventory? Historically, the church supplied allegorical masks for such
awkwardness, [155] but with the Protestant insistence on a literal
understanding of the Bible, the spectre of irreverence returned. [156]

Examining scripture, some believed parts of it so ‘badly written’ that it
would be cruel to lay its authorship at god’s door. [157] Others, citing


-----

scientific explanations for lightning and earthquakes now sneered on
hearing that this was heaven telling mankind off for its sins. [158] Corruption
in the church too invigorated its critics: Several popes, for example, far
from leading lives of selfless celibacy, had fathered children, promoted
them and meddled in politics. [159] The printing press widened this
disenchantment; as a snarky critic warned, the pope had better abolish
‘knowledge and printing’, or the two would ‘root him out’. [160] And by the
eighteenth century, Rome looked besieged.

In this Age of Enlightenment, reason and rationality were leading virtues.

And while there was a flash of atheism, many thinkers retained faith—
except their god was no longer tethered to scripture. [161] The creator, they
argued, was eternal, omniscient and omnipresent; it was _below_ his majesty
to interfere in human affairs, exhibiting miracles or emotions like anger.
Indeed, as the universe’s sovereign, he had little need of worship even; [162]

he left the ‘universe to its own devices’ and was only the ‘first cause of a
self-perpetuating’ world, which could be known via science. [163] Christian
presumptions received rough treatment now. If god intended the Bible for
all, why did he not bestow it upon every society?—a question ‘natives’ also
posed. Why were missionaries resorting to violence if they served divine
offices? No, Christianity failed the test of reason. At best, this religion—of
human design, not divine revelation—was one among several; Biblical tales
were mythology, not fact. Indeed, as knowledge flattened the supernatural,
the Bible—read now by those mothers, children and market folk of Luther’s
hopes—was ‘publicly mocked’. [164] The result was both transformation and
crisis. For if the Reformation separated scripture from church, the
Enlightenment severed god from Christianity. And where we are concerned,
this led to an interesting byproduct: curiosity about ideas on god in _foreign_
cultures. Did men elsewhere possess more reasonable thoughts on divinity?
Could these help imagine a natural, universal religion more compelling than
Christianity? In India, of course, such questions were being asked for
generations: Akbar in the sixteenth century interrogated Islam’s claims to
primacy, for instance, given how ‘truth inhabited every religion’. [165] And


-----

now, a hundred years after Prince Dara’s quest, European brains were also
wondering if pure, uncorrupted monotheism might be retrieved from India’s
Brahmins. After all, more sympathetic accounts of Hinduism were available
now, so that deep in its evidently superstitious forest there seemed to
glimmer great riches.

That Hindu ideas came in handy for intellectual iconoclasts in the West

need not surprise us. Half a millennium before, a Muslim notable had
already presented Brahmin philosophy as monotheism minus revelation and
prophets—exactly the commodity Enlightenment leaders were fishing for.
166 More recently, Ziegenbalg believed ‘natives’ ‘know from the _light of_
_nature_ that there is one god’—they had reached this conclusion without
Biblical guidance. [167] Another man, translating contents from a Hindu text
portrayed its god as ‘subject neither to change nor anxiety’; one ‘whose
nature is indivisible’ and above human qualities; ‘the origin and the cause of
all beings’; and ‘support’ of the universe. [168] This was all most inviting for
proponents of reason. The philosopher Voltaire (1694–1778), for instance,
was no admirer of Hinduism in its current configuration. Brahmins, he
declared, ‘maintain the populace in the most stupid idolatry’. [169] The


-----

religion was a ‘tedious rubbish’ [170] and rank ‘stupidity’. [171] Yet, the man
disliked the church more, writing that if Jesuits accused Indians of bowing
to the devil, it was really ‘they who served him’. [172] And in his anti
_Christian_ polemics, Brahmin knowledge proved useful. 173 It was a matter
of chronology: If Hindu texts predated the Bible, it confirmed that the latter
was not the key to monotheism, nor divine revelation essential. [174] Indeed,
where missionaries sought to ‘prove’ that Indians ‘borrow’d’ their loftier
ideas from the Bible, [175] our Frenchman stressed the opposite: that it was
‘our holy Christian religion’ that was ‘a miserable . . . copy’ of the ‘ancient
Indian theology’. [176] Simply put, white intellectuals, dismissive of Hindu
society in the _present_ , began to romanticize its past (a formula Hindus
would in time also amplify). And in the process, where missionaries hoped
to smash Hinduism, Hindu texts were deployed in the West to try and
dismantle Christianity instead.

The results were somewhat farcical, not least because Europeans actually

knew little about what Sanskrit sources professed. In 1760, Voltaire was
gifted the French translation of a mysterious Hindu text, the _Ezourvedam_ .
Designed as a dialogue between ‘Biach’ (Vyasa, assembler of the Vedas)
and ‘Chumantou’ (Sumantu), in the _Ezourvedam_ whenever the former
dwells on superstitious ideas, the latter reviles it as falsehood. Voltaire was
thrilled, describing this as ‘the Gospel of the ancient bracmans’ and ‘the
oldest book in the world’. [177] One can see why. For one, the _Ezourvedam_
rubbishes prevailing (Puranic) ideas—Vishnu’s avatars, Krishna’s amours,
Siva’s lingam—and ‘Biach’ is told off by ‘Chumantou’ for his faith in
idolatry. No license, thus, is allowed for elements in ‘native’ culture deemed
disagreeable in the West. Chumantou also laments how the Vedas fell into
worthless hands, perverting a pure understanding of god—akin to that
familiar European charge against Catholics. To top this, the text recruits
reason to invalidate irrational traditions. With a story where Vishnu
incarnates as a dwarf to fell a king, Chumantou is outraged: God was above
deception—a view aligned with Enlightenment convictions that divinity
had neither emotions nor a desire to participate in this world. So, from


-----

Voltaire’s perspective, this book looked ideally suited to European
intellectuals’ pet themes. It mattered little that he was warned that the
_Ezourvedam_ was untransparent; that its propositions were too convenient,
even lazily providing a Hindu Adam (‘Adimo’). [178] The more dispassionate
might have paused. But Voltaire’s purpose was never to examine this
material but to wield it against the church. And so, led by ideological
certitude, he declared the _Ezourvedam_ older than the Bible, thus placing
Hindu monotheism centuries before the birth of Christ. [179]

It would take years, but eventually the _Ezourvedam_ was exposed for what

it was: a fabrication. [180] And one leading back to, of all people, our French
Jesuits. When Calmette acquired the Vedas, he shrewdly saw in it utility.
‘Ever since their _Vedam_ . . . has been in our hands,’ wrote the father, ‘we
have extracted texts suitable for convincing [Hindus] of the fundamental
truths that ruin idolatry.’ _À la_ de Nobili, he thought these books held some
good ideas amid largely bad ones, like ‘gold dust on piles of dirt’. [181] The
goal, though, was not to admire the good but call it to arms. For instance,
the texts spoke of one god, while yet celebrating many more deities. Here,
Calmette explained, the Brahmins’ holiest works were already
contradictory. And this, in turn, might cleave the way for the Bible; the
Christians’ book was the _real_ Veda, it could be argued, not inconsistent
Sanskrit literature. Next, having read parts of the Vedas, with a colleague,
he created a text that missionaries could use when debating Hindus. [182] That
is, just as de Nobili took on a Hindu avatar to market Christianity, this tool
adopted the garb of a ‘native’ text to pierce ‘native’ beliefs. [183] So, what
Voltaire used to ‘bludgeon the Christian religion’ in Europe was really an
invention of Catholic priests in India; Calmette’s ‘weapon’, intended to
embarrass and challenge _Hindus_ , was appropriated unknowingly by
enemies of the Bible. [184] Understandably, after the _Ezourvedam_ was
discredited, Voltaire was charged with overzeal and ‘giving this book an
importance which it [did] not deserve’. [185] Luckily, he was dead by then.

But the misadventure is proof of a greater trend: a self-serving romance

around the Vedas—in their impenetrable, mysterious language—among


-----

Enlightenment minds. [186] Of how the West used Eastern cultures in its own
quarrels, alternatively heaping compliments and contempt. For if
missionaries cast their nets for converts in the East, these rivals were
anxious for a fount of monotheism outside the Christian world. In a sense, it
was the _idea_ of the Vedas that gripped Europe, not its contents. Which is
why manuscripts sent to Paris by Calmette sat untranslated for generations.
187 Or as a Jesuit scoffed, the Vedas were glorified because no one could be
bothered to really read them. [188] When actually translated in the next
century, missionaries would in fact encourage their colleagues to freely
study the Vedas so they could ‘emancipate’ themselves from the fallacy that
they contained a ‘bright deposit of truth’. [189] But in the interim, Europe
painted romantic images. John Holwell, an English surgeon, flaunted more
spurious ‘scripture’ in the 1760s: The _Chartah Bhade Shastah_ , he wrote,
contained the Brahmins’ monotheism. This held the ‘originals’ from which
Christianity made its ‘copies’. [190] That this _Shastah_ has never been found
(and was likely a mishmash of questionable provenance) is a different
matter. [191] In the same period, an English captain, Alexander Dow, aired his
finds too, claiming guidance from a ‘learned Brahmin’. [192] Again, we read
of an ancient, pure Hinduism, with a Vedic text, termed the _Bedang,_
presented as its essence. [193] Amusingly, as news of these texts reached him,
Voltaire discarded the _Ezourvedam_ —the _Shastah_ became his newest oldest
book on earth, and the _Bedang_ ‘the most beautiful monument of all
antiquity’. [194]

Simply stated, white thinkers in the West, disillusioned with religion at

home, felt the need to idealize an alternative; to construct a counter with
which to hem in Christianity. Hinduism—once dismissed as a demonic cult
—was presented as just the item. Of course, given that in its popular form—
with temples and idols—it was unfit for service, the approach was selective.
Like our Mughal prince, who culled portions of the Vedas to ‘find’ his
hidden book, Europeans too were picky. They preferred Hinduism’s hazy
antiquity—where they could fill in the blanks as suited them—to its living
reality. Indeed, digging through the debris that was the Hindu present to


-----

revive its past acquired a certain glamour, and all kinds of theories were
professed. Pierre Sonnerat (1748–1814), who first rubbished the
_Ezourvedam_ , declared India humankind’s cradle, for example. [195] As to how
its wisdom was contaminated: the land’s riches, according to him, attracted
invaders. In response, Brahmins veiled their ideas in ‘ingenious allegories’.
196 While this did not dilute the ‘fundamental tenet of the unity of the
deity’, [197] Hindu convictions were hereafter ‘badly translated, or wrongly
interpreted’. [198] The result was that the ‘natives’ grew ignorant, with a
(Puranic) ‘sequel’ conflated with (Vedic) originals. [199] In the West, thus,
Hinduism acquired a top-down reading: Just as Christians had scripture
first, _then_ division and (Catholic) corruption, there was a textual Hinduism,
reduced to fragmented confusion. Authenticity lay in written material; if
another Hinduism dominated in practice, this was perversion—a mirror
construct of the emergence of Protestantism vis-à-vis Catholicism. And
viewed this way, the conclusion was obvious: Hindus’ ‘true religion’ resided
in a ‘faithful translation of the Vedams’. [200] Everything else was a weak,
toxic appendage, and ought to be discarded to retrieve a purer nucleus—a
premise that lingers on to this day.

Of course, this was historically unsound. Puranic Hinduism emerged not

because of invasions but through an interaction between the Brahmins’
religion, as it migrated with them across the subcontinent, with a variety of
local systems. It was the Puranas—exactly the material dismissed now for
irrationality, its carnal gods and temples—that was truly representative of
Hindus at large. The Vedas, on the other hand, had remained the preserve of
a small, select set of Brahmins and scholars. In Europe, it might have been
the case that priests concealed scripture from the masses, and were called
on, therefore, to democratize access. In India, however, Brahmins had
largely adjusted _their_ position to the demands of local societies, much like
de Nobili assumed a ‘native’ appearance to transmit Christianity to Tamils.
Hinduism was not a fixed set of ideas from one batch of texts but a hybrid
culture of overlapping encounters. Europeans, however, came to believe
that, as with the Bible, the Vedas alone were real Hinduism, and that all


-----

hopes of salvation must be pinned to it. Importing European dynamics into
India, white men in effect expected ordinary Hindus—of so many castes,
with so many histories, no one like the other—to subscribe purely to an
orthodox, ancient Brahmin position, when historically this was a more
complex engagement. But at this stage, little was known of India’s past, and
‘natives’ of the present were viewed as hopeless. And so, as one
commentator put it, given how Hindus had no means of redressing their
situation—like Catholic laypeople who suffered for centuries under a
diabolical papal regime—the West would supply ‘conscientious . . .
interpreter[s]’. [201]

In other words, foreigners would teach Indians ‘authentic’ Hinduism and

where to find it. But this also begs the question: How did Hindus
themselves perceive the Vedas traditionally?

In the ninth century CE , there lived in Tamil country a man we know as
Nammalvar. He was a devotee of Vishnu, composing over 1000 verses in
praise of the deity. His writing is packed with Puranic details—Vishnu’s
triumph over demons, his incarnations, his beauty and physical attributes—
while also simultaneously declaring him god of gods, the almighty. It was
all bhakti, devotion. Interestingly, in the succeeding centuries, Nammalvar’s
four collections were equated with the four Vedas, like them proclaimed
timeless and eternal. Indeed, recitation of his poems became an integral part
of temple ritual in these parts. Joint to the work of eleven other poet-saints,
the complete corpus—of 4000 Vaishnava verses—are now known as the
Tamil Veda. Or as Vishnu is shown to state in a later account, ‘The Vedic
(brahmins) who recite the [Sanskrit] Vedas . . . do not understand what they
chant, and are caught in delusion.’ So, ‘I shall render the Vedas in Tamil’.
202 Theologians in future would go to great pains to demonstrate how
Nammalvar’s bhakti was an encapsulation of Vedic principle; that, in fact,
the point of the Vedas themselves was Vishnu’s supremacy. Some would


-----

even brand the Tamil Vedas superior to the Sanskrit. For as rivers are
‘cloudy and mixed’ at the source, becoming ‘clear[er] and drinkable’
downstream, so also the Sanskrit texts were confusing, unlike their filtered
Tamil alternative. [203] As such this was not an unusual claim: In the same
age, Saivas, positioning Siva as the highest divinity, said similar things.
That is, sects competed to assert that they alone had comprehended the
Vedas properly. Indeed, in one source, critics remark to Nammalvar: ‘ _we_
have not heard the Vedas utter [what you say]; this must be your
imagination’. [204]

-----

But what did the Vedas ‘utter’? Compiled thousands of years ago in north

and north-western India, the Vedas are not one thing but many. [205] Their
older portions are often called the _karma-kanda_ , focused on sacrifice, rituals
and invocations to ancient deities (most of whom would be overshadowed
by Vishnu and Siva). The _vedanta_ —the ‘end’ of the Vedas, both in a literal
and metaphorical sense—meanwhile is the _jnana-kanda_ , the repository of
wisdom, containing the Upanishads. These are the pillars of Hindu
philosophy. Thus we find, in even the oldest, highest Brahminical scripture,
several layers reflecting different time periods and its motivations. [206] This
is also why, where Europeans were concerned, contradictory views emerged
on the Vedas, depending on who read what. For as a colonial era authority
put it, the Upanishads came from ‘an entirely different state of the Hindu
mind’ than the more primitive previous sections. [207] Missionaries, then,
could underline prior parts of the Vedic corpus, with their many gods and
ritualism, dismissing the Vedas as a polytheistic fruit salad. Others studying
the Upanishads saw sophisticated ideas and pronounced monotheistic urges.
As a nineteenth-century American philosopher wrote, these described ‘the
first inquisitive and contemplative access’ to divinity. The Vedas here paved
‘a loftier course through a purer stratum—free from particulars, simple,
universal’, offering a ‘sensible account of God’. [208] So even if the Rig
Veda’s opening section invokes Agni (fire), Vayu (wind) and other deities,
in the Upanishads, we find statements of a different variety: ‘This Self is
never born, nor does It die. It did not spring from anything, nor did anything
spring from It. This Ancient One is unborn, eternal, everlasting.’ [209]

But the Vedas’ internal richness aside, history also impacted their place in

Hinduism. Indeed, if Hindus outside philosophical circles were asked about
their relationship with the Vedas, they would have shrugged, ‘It’s
complicated.’ Certainly, the texts commanded formal supremacy. In fact, a
seventeenth-century poet construed it a special compliment to accredit a
_Muslim_ patron master of the Vedas. [210] But their direct presence in Hindus’
lives was limited. In and of itself, this was not unusual. In Europe, the
‘majority of medieval people’ knew only ‘rudiments’ of their faith; religion


-----

was not ‘a series of propositions to be believed but a series of practices to
be undertaken’. If the Vedas were unknown to most Hindus—including
many Brahmins—so too the Bible was ‘alien to the great majority’ of lay
Christians. [211] And for the ordinary ‘native’ too, it was daily rituals of caste
—how one dressed, what one ate—in parallel to temple-worship, that
constituted religion. Yet, there was a difference. For while Christianity drew
from a core book, Hindus possessed a wider, segmented archive. After all,
Hinduism was an ‘amoeba-like cluster of practices and beliefs’, [212] stitching
up countless groups, ideologies, gods and identities in various periods
across vast geographies. [213] Each thread in this evolving web had a
personality; each could inform and alter others while retaining its
distinctness. [214] Of course, there were links but by design, it was not
feasible for one book to authoritatively represent a bottom-up order like
Hinduism. And in more real terms, the religion’s outlines were fixed not so
much by the Vedas but by the epics—the Mahabharata and Ramayana—
along with orally transmitted Puranic tales. It is these that most Hindus
identify with even today, the Vedas being primarily a restricted Brahmin
concern. [215]

And yet, just as the stature of the Brahmin was generally acknowledged,

the priority of his holy texts was also endorsed—even if few knew what lay
in them. And in the process, Hindus formed a novel method of linking all
kinds of other texts to the Vedas, much like Nammalvar’s poetry ‘became’
the Tamil Veda. Historically speaking, his was the devotional expression of
a human being at a specific moment. Yet, in theological terms, his writings
were creatively interpreted as not just divine utterances but as completely
Vedic; this way they were made palatable to the orthodox while
simultaneously granting Tamil texts high status. This was part of a pattern:
Different Hindu scriptures of varying origins could all claim Vedic
inspiration. Thus, one text might anoint itself a ‘restatement’ of the Vedas;
the epics could be described as their ‘recapitulation’ for mass consumption;
another source might be styled a ‘reflection’ of their knowledge and so on.
216 Puranas representing competing sects, in fact, even claimed to be ‘equal


-----

of the Vedas’, demoting rivals. [217] In many cases, there might be little direct
connection to the actual ancient scriptures; but even without a concrete
communion, a nominal ‘tip of the hat’ was the norm. [218] For as Brahmins
synthesized different beliefs into Hinduism, they did not supplant them,
seeking just a ‘legitimizing reference’ to the Vedas. [219] Indeed, in complex
cases, with trademark dexterity, they could even declare that these traditions
stemmed from Vedas now ‘lost’. [220] Either way, room and board for diverse
texts was available, in which none surrendered their validity, while the
Vedas occupied an honorary head office.

Predictably, there were schools that tested this. Some Saiva traditions, for

example. [221] One text, the _Sivadharmottara_ brands Vedic studies a ‘waste’.
222 Another subordinates the Vedas; Saiva scriptures emerged from god’s
‘highest’ face, the Vedas only from ‘inferior faces’. [223] In the _Narada_
_Sutras_ , similarly, bhakti triumphs ‘even the Vedas’. [224] Nevertheless,
implicit here is recognition of the texts as a gold standard. And in time,
most sects, including several ‘propounding _anti_ -Vedic’ ideas, were
reconciled via ‘statements of conformity’. [225] Similarly, though the Vedas
show little room for image worship, Vedic mantras became an essential
component of temple ritual. So even if ‘large segments of Hindus’ had only
thin links to them, to suggest that the Vedas did not matter to Hinduism
would be ‘as unhistorical as to argue that Aristotle was irrelevant to
medieval Christianity since undoubtedly few European peasants were
familiar with his work’. [226] And yet their role in active religion was not the
same as Western scripture. [227] This was not because a ‘native’ analogue of
the Catholic clergy cunningly veiled them but because different types of
Hindus had different types of scriptures. White writers, though, were
oblivious to such nuances. Instead of recognizing the numerous rivulets that
together form the Hindu tradition, they assumed that a single fount came
first, splintering over time into the seemingly muddy streams and puddles of
‘idolatrous’ Hinduism. In any case, the Hindu attitude vis-à-vis scripture
would have scandalized them. For applied to the Western context, this was
akin to saying that one could back a range of things—from idols to animal


-----

sacrifice—and remain Christian by acknowledging the Bible. Or rebrand
pagan knowledge, adding with a wink that this was but an ‘abridgement’ of
church-approved scripture.

Nevertheless, in Western eyes, ‘pure’ Hinduism gained a definite

appearance: The Vedas were its Bible, and a certain kind of orthodox,
scholarly Brahmin alone could speak for it. This latter point was all too
obvious. Rogerius in his _Open Door_ , for instance, complained that most
present-day Brahmins had little grasp of the ‘philosophy for which their
ancestors were so famous’. [228] In Goa, de Nobili dismissed its Brahmins as
‘not genuine’. Why? Because, by his own reading of Sanskrit scripture, the
truest claimants to that rank were those who ‘exclusively pursue[d] learning
and are versed in the books’. [229] The temple Brahmin and others had
compromised with popular religion, forfeiting all right to speak for
Hinduism, that is. Naturally, there was no question of consulting nonBrahmins; or as Dow wrote, ‘illiterate cast[e]s’ and ‘inferior tribes’ would
not do. [230] Focusing on Sanskrit, an emphasis on a literal interpretation of
ancient texts, divorced from historical dynamics, would become all too
normal with Europeans—this in a culture of orality, where even the Vedas
were first an oral tradition. [231] For this way, foreigners could access
Hinduism, without their foreignness feeling too grave a handicap. [232] It also
offered the added advantage of fitting preconceived cultural ideas born of
the Protestant approach to the Bible. It did not matter that this ‘pure’
Hinduism foreigners idealized never existed; to expect all Hindus to
become rigid votaries of the Vedas was to construct something artificial. So
much so that when in the nineteenth century, ‘native’ figures themselves
attempted to raise up a scripturalist Hinduism, the majority ignored them,
sticking to their temples and custom. [233] Hindus, in the past as today, that is,
show no anxiety to gain direct access to the Vedas: Based on family, caste
and regional traditions, faith remains available in a variety of formats,
leaving scriptural concerns to Brahmins and philosophers.

Yet, however, it is worth remembering that there were always within

Hinduism itself strands of thinking that coincided with European ideas.


-----

There were always ultraconservative Brahmins who too dismissed temples
and mass Hinduism. To these purists also, the Vedas, and nothing but the
Vedas, defined Hinduism. Which is why, late in the nineteenth century, as
the Hindu religion was defined in a Protestant mould, a Brahmin writer
would openly state that what was meant by (modern) Hinduism was
‘Brahmanism’—this even as he admitted that down the ladder, observance
of Brahminical norms was only ‘fractional’. [234] There were other parallels
too. Western ideas of the decline of Hinduism from its ancient purity found
validation in the Brahmin concept of the kali yuga, the dark age of
corruption. While this was a historical fiction to justify and enable
adjustments and coping strategies in a plural society, it sat neatly with
European speculations—of living Hinduism as the superstitious shadow of
a pristine original Vedic system. The same applies to Sanskrit sources.
These, while reflecting a Brahmin ideal, did not reflect uniform truths. As
the scholar Audrey Truschke observes, ‘Despite claims to encompass all
knowable things in the world, many Sanskrit [works] do not match what
people did in real life.’ [235] Indeed, historically, Brahmin writings were often
composed in _reaction_ to preexisting tendencies on the ground—scriptural
expostulations compensated for practical inadequacies, and served to help
narrative catch up with reality. [236] Now however, a set of Sanskrit books
was almost mechanically construed as the ‘authentic’ core of a shambolic
religious system—and there were at least some Hindu authorities willing to
operate on these terms, energized in their own conservatism by conditions
of Western creation.

Of course, the majority of ‘natives’ might yet have ignored these

unbalanced readings of their traditions. European debates around Hinduism
would have been just that: noise on a distant, unfamiliar continent. Hindus,
after all, rarely sought out an ‘original’ faith: Their religion was mixed,
complicated and disputed even—but it was what it was; a living, organic,
elastic entity. But then, political events began to make a difference: The
advent of the white man’s rule gave white men’s ideas the muscle to remake
reality. For by the time Voltaire sang his praises of the _Ezourvedam_ , the
English East India Company had triumphed at the Battle of Plassey (1757)

in eastern India. Strangers were on the way to becoming the country’s
masters. And in their effort to understand the land, they would not only fall
back on half-boiled theories but also infuse these with power and certainty.
Indeed, by the 1860s, it would be entirely normal for British judges in
India, citing white scholars of Hinduism along with Protestant-style Hindu
reformers, to declare centuries old sects as ‘contrary to . . . the ancient [and,
thus, “real”] Hindu religion’. [237] Men could remark coolly that ‘books
which were written after the Vedas’ lacked merit; [238] that no living sect ‘at
present’ was genuinely Hindu. [239] This is not to say that Hindus passively
absorbed these Europeans notions, however. On the contrary, as we shall
see, they resisted in myriad ways. But even in battling colonialism and its
ideological filters—shaped by Christianity, Western contests, the
Enlightenment and plain misreading—certain European filters were,
nonetheless, coopted. Wedded to matching indigenous ideas, these would be
recast as, in fact, Indian. It was in these circumstances that Hinduism’s
current avatar emerged—with one foot in tradition, the other in European
sensibilities and confusion.

#### THREE

 GOVERNING THE GENTOOS

In 1804, the governor general of the English East India Company received a
letter from a band of Hindu priests in coastal Orissa. News of Lord
Wellesley’s ‘everlasting fame’, they chorused in Sanskrit, had reached
them, causing great delight. He was, after all, ‘the unrivalled sun that [had]
caused to bloom the lotus that is the English race’, and ‘numerous women’
were singing his praises. The priests too were doing their bit, ‘praying night
and day’ that Wellesley might protect them and their deity. Indeed, while
under previous (Hindu) rulers these Brahmins faced ‘obstruction even in the
smallest matter’, now ‘we enjoy happiness’; the hope, therefore, was that
their ‘holy city may continue . . . for ever’ under the Company Raj. [1] It was
all intended to ingratiate themselves with the area’s new masters, of course,
though what the governor general made of the letter is not known. He is
unlikely to have been surprised: Two years earlier, another Brahmin had
already showered him with matching paeans. Wellesley, this man
rhapsodised, surpassed ‘all monarchs of sacred memory’. Restoring justice
on earth, he had sent his enemies ‘wander[ing] in terror’. [2] The trend,
therefore, was clear, as all the old panegyrics heaped on Indian kings—
Hindu and Muslim both—were trotted out now for the newest (Christian)
power in the land. [3]

It had taken two centuries for the Company to achieve this status. Like

the Portuguese before, ever since the English established trading posts in
the country, they had been interacting with Hindus. But unlike the
Portuguese, caution was their first principle: Or as Thomas Roe, royal
envoy to Emperor Jahangir (Akbar’s successor), famously urged, wisdom
lay ‘in quiet trade’, and folly in seeking ‘garrisons and land wars in India’. [4]


-----

Evidently in agreement, through the seventeenth century, English merchants
usually treated local rulers—ranging from a petty rani in Kerala to
Chhatrapati Shivaji, founder of the Maratha state—with watchful respect. [5]

Hindu writers, meanwhile, recorded mixed reviews. A Telugu poet, on the
founding of the Company’s base in Madras, held that the region’s ruler, fed
up with Portuguese and Dutch quarrels, had simply planted the English in
the middle for reprieve. [6] Another Sanskrit composition has two celestials
touring India by sky. Hovering above the town, one of these _gandharva_ s
lists everything wrong with white folk: They gave Brahmins all the honour
they might grass, so naturally, ‘their villainy is inexpressible at the end of
the tongue’. The other, however, was prepared to be lenient: The English
did not ‘unjustly extort’, they ‘never [spoke] false’, they followed the law
and traded in all kinds of ‘curious’ articles. [7] There was, then, good and bad
both about these strangers—it was too soon to arrive at a categorical
conclusion. [8]

The good must have prevailed at first, for many were drawn to the city.

And by the time Madras next appeared in Sanskrit poetry late in the
eighteenth century, it was a Hinduized place with gods, Brahmins and
powerful brown men. Most of these last were _dubashe_ s, or assistants, to the
British; [9] and as white traders grew rich through exports, their Indian
supporters pumped the commissions _they_ earned into traditional channels of
patronage. Besides sponsoring courtesans and poets, as one British grandee
remarked, ‘in this Country, Men who are fond of shewing their Wealth and
Grandeur have as yet found no better means of displaying Them than by the
building of Temples’. [10] Company-sponsored wealth creation, that is, led to
a boom in Hindu practice. Indeed, even though Indians and Europeans lived
apart in white and black quarters, cultural exchange was inevitable—the
violin was eased into ‘classical’ south Indian music, [11] while the British
governor’s processions featured dancing girls and ‘country musick’. [12] In
fact, the Company arbitrated caste disputes, [13] while its coins featured
Hindu gods. [14] More intimate intercourse was also underway: ‘[o]ver half
of marriages [recorded] at Madras’ in 1700 were between white men and
local women. [15] Only the odd orthodox voice protested—that same
eighteenth-century poem has an anguished character ask how Hindus could
kowtow to ‘white-faced’ foreigners. To this, his interlocutor sagely replies,
that just as people lived under the wicked (but great) king Ravana of the
Ramayana, so Madras carried on under English merchant-rajahs. [16]

As with Muslim conquerors long ago, Hindus were, in their own way,

making sense of a foreign race. There was part rejection, yes, but also at
first a strange, intrigued acceptance.

The transformation of the Company into what a critic lambasted as ‘a state
in the disguise of a merchant’ was a process that lasted an age. [17] If in 1757,
the victory of their troops against the nawab of Bengal netted 1,50,000 sq.
miles of territory in eastern India, it would be 1849 before the Sikh empire


-----

in the north-west folded. Mysore in the south was crushed in 1799, while
the Marathas of the Deccan—the subcontinent’s final major force—were
defeated in 1818. As for India’s increasingly titular suzerains, the Mughals,
the last of them would in 1858 be exiled on a bullock cart to Burma. The
whole thing occurred in fits and spurts, but it was not as though Indian
powers were naïve as to what was happening: Well before the subjugation
of Bengal, a Maratha treatise warned of the perils of merchants acquiring
too much nerve. Certainly, as a class they were ‘ornaments’ of the state and
key to general enrichment. [18] However, added the _Ajnapatra_ (1715), rajahs
had better watch out for Portuguese, English, Dutch, French, Danish and
other ‘hat-wearers’. For,

. . . these are not like the other merchants. Each of them is subject to [foreign] kings, and
it is by _their_ command that these men come here. Can it be that kings do not covet
territory? No, the hat-wearers certainly have designs to penetrate our provinces, swell
their lands, and consecrate their own ideas [ _svamat_ ]. Indeed, in various places they have
already succeeded, and where territory has come into their obstinate grip, even death
cannot part them from it. It is best to let them come and go, with no permanent base . . . If
they must be given land, let it be in the plains, far from the sea, where their guns and
ships lie . . . Let them build no forts and permanent structures. If they get on quietly on

these terms, it is fine; if not, there is no need for them. [19]

Wellcome Collection.

In pre-1757 Bengal, in fact, its nawab (Mughal governor) appears to have
been acting from corresponding motives when he objected to the Company
fortifying its base at Calcutta. [20] And as they defied him, he took the place
by force. Unfortunately, the British had a strong army in the south, which
moved for revenge—since the 1740s, Anglo–French rivalries in _Europe_ had
set off proxy wars between their trading companies in the peninsula. Both
augmented their forces and loaned them out as mercenaries in local political
disputes. [21] Now, with a crisis in Bengal, British troops sailed up to save the
day. While traditionally, the Company’s victory is ascribed to the genius of
Robert Clive (1725–74)—a rowdy schoolboy-turned-clerk-turnedcommander—the fact is that he had plenty of support inside Bengal. For the


-----

nawab was an unpleasant man, prone, it is said, to drowning people for
amusement. [22] In the space of under a year after his succession, he had
alienated everyone from his own generals and ministers to the land’s great
bankers, the Jagat Seths. [23] So, Clive’s arrival offered multiple interests an
opportunity to rid themselves of an unpopular master. What everyone
sought was a return to the way things were in the last nawab’s day—and at
the Battle of Plassey, therefore, much of the incumbent’s own army stood
aside, waiting for his reign to combust. [24]

Soon afterwards, Clive and his fellow power brokers installed a more

pliable nawab, but there was no returning to the earlier status quo. Boats
full of treasure had left for Calcutta after Plassey, and British officers
benefitted individually—Clive received not only over £200,000 in cash but
also lands producing £27,000–30,000 per annum; instantly, this Shropshire
man became one of the first white ‘nabobs’ flushing Britain with new
money. [25] Having feasted on this yield, Company servants in Bengal had
every incentive to keep meddling in its affairs. [26] They pressed the nawab
for partisan policy and replaced him when he objected to English noses in
unwanted places. Indeed, London too was upset: Spoils of war had birthed a
proclivity for conflict, and in 1759, Company directors were complaining
that their Bengal colleagues were so ‘thoroughly possessed with military
ideas’, they seemed to forget ‘your employers are merchants’. [27] But their
protests went unheeded and by 1765, not only had the Company beat the
Mughal emperor in the field, they also forced him to relinquish to Calcutta
the revenues of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. [28] In eastern India, the British had
now become what one observer would describe as merchant–sovereigns and
sovereign–merchants. And it was this that would embolden them to jettison
the relatively balanced compact seen in Madras for rank imperialism. [29]

It is often assumed, however, that the capture of the Indian subcontinent

by ‘the British’ was an orderly enterprise promoted by the king’s
government and by every level of society. [30] The state was certainly
embroiled in Company affairs, not only by claiming a portion of Bengal’s
income but also because as early as 1764, seventy elected parliamentarians


-----

were shareholders of the very corporate machine they would soon be asked
to regulate. The wealth it generated had social repercussions too—Indiareturns and their foreign loot upset economic and political balances in [31]
British society, [32] and there was intellectual angst that disproportionate
luxury would deliver that nation to vice. [33] But many also voiced criticism
about the obscenely long leash permitted the Company—it created a
divided sovereignty between government and ‘licensed bandits’, [34]

producing two standards and glaring immorality. [35] Multiple figures
condemned the Company’s expansionism: Adam Smith rebuked ‘the
plunderers of India’ in his _Wealth of Nations_ (1776), [36] while Edmund
Burke logged those ‘frauds and delusions’ that let loose in Bengal a
disgraceful ‘tyranny’. [37] As early as 1772, even an ex-Company employee
warned that British-ruled Indian territories would go ‘from bad to worse’,
given that its protectors were really profit-miners. [38] In this phase, then,
there was much discomfort around British conduct in the East—an element
visible also in the unsettled postures Company men displayed in action.

The varying attitudes of individual governors general are proof: Where

Warren Hastings made a warped effort—as we shall see—to rule in
consonance with local norms in the 1770s and 1780s, his successor, Lord
Cornwallis, preferred a disdaining aloofness, convinced that ‘every native
was irreversibly corrupt’. [39] Meanwhile, double-dealing _within_ Company
ranks rankled: In Madras, a governor was locked up by his own council
when he sniffed out their clandestine financial arrangements with a nearby
prince. [40] Another was notorious for routing bribes via his brother and
dubash—an investigation, predictably, brought punishment only to the man
with the darker skin. [41] Quarrels broke out between the Board of Control
(created by parliament to moderate the Company) and the Company’s
directors, [42] and between the directors in turn and men on the ground. [43]

Wellesley, for example, was an unapologetic imperialist: ‘no greater
blessing,’ he wrote in 1801, could be ‘conferred on . . . India than the
extension of British authority’. [44] By the time angry superiors charged him
with ‘a pure and simple despotism’, the man had conquered Mysore, bested


-----

the Marathas and seized control even of the Mughal emperor. [45] Wellesley’s
successor tried to rein things in but in vain: As a subordinate scoffed, he
‘may as well set his chair on the sands of the sea and order the waves to
stop’. [46] For by then, the British in India were, in another witness’s view,
‘no longer Merchants, but Sovereigns of a vast Empire’. [47] And this, in spite
of unnerved directors in London.

Internal turmoil, thus, pervaded the British encounter with India, and

inconsistencies defined policy in territories the Company swept up. For
instance, in Bengal, with political competition pulped, the British got away
with breathtakingly bad administrative innovations. [48] On the other hand, in
Madras, officials were more circumspect, alert to the limits of their power.
Strong local states existed here till the end of the eighteenth century, and
Company servants knew privation and resistance. While secure Bengal had
an over-strong army, Madras troops, in wars against Mysore, marched tens
of miles on empty stomachs, sleeping without shelter. [49] If the Company
were formidable in eastern India, that is, in the south and west, it was
haunted by vulnerability, infecting its officers with a lifelong paranoia. [50]

All this affected politics. In business matters too, the British were
dependent on Indian bankers, [51] while as late as 1808, strategic intelligence
was so shoddy that a commander wrote: ‘beyond the Jumna [river] all is
conjecture’. [52] Fear of revolt was eternal—precisely why the emasculated
but symbolically potent emperor in Delhi was a concern. As Wellesley
warned, ‘the person and authority’ of the padshah rendered him ‘a
dangerous instrument in the hands’ of an antagonistic power. [53] So,
dislodging the Marathas, the Company transferred him to its ‘protection’,
fearful that he might become the figurehead its enemies needed to rally
together. [54] All the proverbial glory linked with conquest, thus, barely
masks the uncertainty and stress saturating the British experience in India.

What is interesting for our purposes, though, is that this caution at first

also extended to Hindu institutions and cultural centres. When the Company
snatched Orissa from the Marathas in 1803, Wellesley, for example, issued
instructions to ‘use every possible means to conciliate the inhabitants’,
paying ‘particular attention’ to the famous temple of Jagannath at Puri.
While political interest in the region hinged on connecting Bengal to
Madras on the map, for winning over the _people_ and stabilizing the
conquest, the governor general looked to the deity. British troops were, he
wrote, to take ‘every possible precaution to preserve the respect due to the
pagoda’ and honour the ‘sanctity of the religious edifices’ as well as the
‘prejudices of the Brahmins’. [55] After all, from the thirteenth century
onwards, Orissa’s kings had legitimized their claims over the province
through Jagannath; dynasties rose and fell, but they all bowed to the deity,


-----

who remained a constant. [56] The Mughals too had recognised the shrine’s
value: When once the gods absconded during a crisis, their imperial
governor forcibly repatriated the idols—profits from the pilgrim economy
were too lucrative even for a Muslim power to resist. [57] After the Marathas
took the region, they also made rich grants to validate their rule; and with
the area succumbing to the Company now, it was the turn of the British to
continue the pattern. [58] Or as a report explained, ‘[i]n a political light [the
temple’s] value is incalculable.’ [59] And prudence paid: Since Wellesley had
respected ‘native’ sentiments, the temple’s custodians responded with that
grandiloquent Sanskrit letter quoted at the start of this chapter.

Tellingly, Puri was no exception. Already in the 1780s, the Company was

involved in temple affairs in upper India. [60] As its authority spread out into
the southern hinterland from Madras, here too white men became guardians
of gods, managing festivals and religious endowments, British troops
marching in Hindu processions. In 1789, we see, thus, an officer
investigating the accounts of a Madras shrine, [61] and five years later, a
second restoring sacred buildings in the vicinity. [62] In fact, by the 1830s,
British civil servants would be watching over 7500 temples in just their
peninsular territories. [63] Many made gifts to deities: A ‘Clive’, possibly son
of Robert from Plassey, donated a _makara kandigai_ (necklace) at
Kanchipuram; the _Munro-gangalam_ (vessel) at Tirupati was presented by
the famous Thomas Munro. In Travancore, the Company agent offered a
‘silver umbrella with emerald pendants’ to the official state deity, [64] while in
Madurai, a revenue collector placed ‘valuable jewels’ before its goddess. [65]

Before long, local legends drew these officials into Puranic-style narratives.
In the case of the Travancore man, when he once dealt unfairly with a
temple, he was ‘taken mysteriously ill and filled with such nameless dread’,
that he admitted its power. [66] In another story, when he scoffs at the
menstruation rites of a female divinity, his wife is paralysed with bleeding.
67 The template in these tales is clear: The overbearing outsider is small fry
when it comes to Hindu deities. [68] In a lopsided way, these accounts made
room to reconcile with British dominion, as if proclaiming: ‘If you respect


-----

our customs, we may yet accept your government’—something once done
with Muslim powers. [69]

In a sense, as de Nobili in Madurai had Hinduized Christianity in the

previous century, many Company men dressed their politics in Indian
muslin at this juncture. Though some did genuinely respect Hindu culture,
few were innocent of the imperial mission; that is, regard for ‘native’
sensibilities emerged from considerations of security. As Cornwallis had
warned, ‘disaffection in our native troops’—the backbone of ‘our
existence’—was to be avoided at all costs. [70] And mutiny in Vellore in
1806, a reaction to interference in matters of religion and identity, made the
Company nervous. General sentiment also mattered: After the defeat of the
Marathas in 1818, an officer recorded how ‘the very minds of the
inhabitants’ were conquered but this was no guarantee ‘these feelings will
be permanent’. [71] An army could dominate, but not sustain conquest; so, the
British would have to compensate by filling Hindu dynastic shoes as
seamlessly as possible. Or as James Stuart wrote, by ‘participating with
natives of rank and influence’ and ‘avoiding interference with [their]
customs and institutions’ the Company could ‘soften the odium naturally
attendant upon the sway of strangers’. [72] After all, if even enervated figures
like the Mughal emperor were ‘magnets for disaffection’, it was because of
their cultural capital; in acting as they did, the British were coaxing a
transfer of ownership for the same substance. [73] As such, this ought not to
surprise us, because the Company was no monolithic, tidy enterprise with a
single approach—it took different forms in different areas, under a host of
leaders. At this point, there was no single, dominant strand of imperialism,
only skittish variants attempting to establish what might keep ‘native’
energies sedated.

It was this pragmatism, then, that encouraged accommodation in the

early nineteenth century. For example, on annexing Poona, seat of the
Peshwas (premiers) of the Maratha state, in 1818, the Company was
determined to project continuity. Little rituals—such as firing a gun
morning and night—were sustained to avoid ‘alarm attendant upon a


-----

translation from an old to a new state of things’. [74] The city’s bankers were
mollified; a ceremony for the rain gods was kept up; traditional
punishments, such as blackening faces of convicts, continued and when an
official arrived, he distributed presents to hundreds of holy men to show
‘the Hindoos . . . [that] persons whom they respect are not intended to be
neglected under the new Govt’. [75] Orders were given, similarly, to support
temples, thereby demonstrating ‘our anxiety to respect the religion of the
country’, [76] while in towns where the Company army committed wartime
plunder and rape, ceremonial Hindu remedies were arranged to correct the
resultant ‘unfortunate impression’. [77] Still unsure, the British even offered
the people a familiar focus of loyalty: a ‘counterpoise to the remaining
influence’ of the defeated Peshwa state. [78] The Marathas had a king whose
power was usurped by the Peshwas long ago. [79] While a proposal that the
Company claim Peshwa-hood for itself was set aside, [80] a restoration, albeit
in a small enclave, was orchestrated for the king. As with the Mughal
emperor, the attempt here too was to mask the Company’s alien origins by
posing as custodians of ‘legitimate’ authority. Surely the British could not
be _all_ that strange and ignoble if they righted historical wrongs and pursued
political justice for brown princes?

Internally, of course, the British infantilized the king—his delight on his

renewal was compared to that of a schoolboy, which is precisely how his
newest wardens treated him. [81] This tone is critical: The Company, even if it
tolerated Hindu customs, rarely understood or endorsed them. And if it
came to conflict between British authority and Hindu ideas, it was clear
which would prevail. [82] The restored Maratha _chhatrapati_ (king) was told
as much: By no means was Company aid to be construed as reviving ‘even
in name’ the Maratha imperium, for then ‘the machine we are setting up
will be liable to be turned against us’. [83] Since _they_ had taken the king out
of a gilded prison and given him a district, they retained the right to undo
him—as would indeed occur when he assumed ‘exaggerated notions of his
consequence’. [84] So too, local nobles had their rank guaranteed by the
Company, contingent, however, on obedience. When disbanding the old


-----

regime’s army, similarly, the British supplied as many pensions as feasible

85
—because ‘deprived . . . of every means of maintaining themselves’, the exsoldiers might feel a temptation to ‘raise insurrections’. As for the mass
of Brahmins who had benefitted from the largesse of the fallen Peshwa,
while the Company frowned at ‘indiscriminate charities’, they did continue
a yearly contest where Sanskrit masters received prizes. [86] In other words, a
foreign corporation was walking a tightrope between its imperial agendas
and fitting the mould of a Hindu rajah. And if in Bengal an accident of
history made the Company rulers, here there was a conscious—and cautious
—building of empire, by alert white hands in a land with many shades of
brown. [87]

Unsurprisingly, several Company officials in this period felt the need to

explicate on just how this delicate venture should be managed—particularly
if it were to prove more than a fleeting exploit. In the words of John
Malcolm (1769–1833), in charge of central India after the fall of the
Marathas, British survival depended on keeping Indian grievances from
bubbling over. Indians had to feel a ‘recurring sense’ of benefit which, in
turn, was dependent on the Company staying ‘in good temper with [local]
prejudices, their religion, and usages’. [88] Mountstuart Elphinstone (1779–
1859), responsible for Maratha territories in the west, agreed—he offered


-----

Akbar as a model, for that Mughal emperor built cultural bridges, showed
tolerance, delivered prosperity and reconciled Hindus to Muslim rule. [89]

Allowing intrusion by European ideas and institutions was dangerous, for
‘even just government will not be a blessing if at variance with the habits
and character of the people’. [90] The British must speak to the ‘natives’ in
_their_ language, not expect them to lap up English ideals. Thomas Munro
(1761–1827), therefore, warned white officers from Madras to avoid being
‘fanatics in politics’. An emerging European tendency to ‘suppose that no
country can be saved without [Western] institutions’, must be discarded, for
the ‘natives’ already had ‘their own to answer every useful object’. [91] Only
such a middle path would permit British power to endure. Indians might
accept foreign domination if those foreigners made an effort—or at least a
show of it—to respect their modes and mores (a proposition the Portuguese
in Goa had struggled with). [92]

But then again, precisely because the Company had internal dissonances,

there was opposition also to such proposals; there was always an equal
number of men who rubbished all this prattle about accommodation. Why
bother when the British owned hard power? India ought to be subjected to
both Western morality and its institutions. Munro, for instance, was resisted
by a superior who branded Indian legal institutions ‘crude and barbarous’,
seeing no reason why a British government should uphold them. That is, if
Indians paraded criminals with blackened faces, white men should teach
them to abjure such methods. This opponent, in fact, felt European judges
need not even learn local languages: Since quarrels always had the same
triggers, any ‘man who knew law could give justice to any society on
earth’. [93] While Munro believed British rule ‘should be gradually
withdrawn’, [94] others dismissed the notion as preposterous. Even the grant
of a handsome pension by Elphinstone to the toppled Peshwa—a
‘reasonable bargain’, as he saw it, ‘to purchase a quiet abdication’—invited
disapproval. [95] But the real dispute was more fundamental: As the scholar
Gauri Viswanathan puts it, some were ‘resistant to replacing the rule of men
with the rule of law’, advocating instead paternalist government and a


-----

personal touch. [96] Impersonal, mechanical modes—particularly when the
rulers were aliens—risked widening an already worrying cultural chasm.
Elphinstone, for example, did not like brown people, but even so he felt a
‘duty’ towards them. [97] ‘[Y]ou must,’ he lectured officers, ‘take [them]
along with you and give them a share in your feelings, which can be done
by sharing theirs.’ [98]

Empire, he seemed to be saying, was rarely a just affair. But with some

effort, it could be made to look less unjust—and, thus, prevail. Of course, in
theory this all sounded perfectly sensible; putting it into practice, however,
particularly at the requisite scale, would prove a Himalayan challenge. And
in the British failure to ultimately carry this forward—or bungle it up when
they tried—lay a leading trigger for anti-colonial mobilization. Including
among preceptors of what we now call Hindu nationalism.

Long before men like Elphinstone and Munro advocated a government of
benevolence, there had been in Bengal a man who attempted to rule the
‘natives’ on this pattern. Warren Hastings (1732–1818) at five-foot-five was
a small man with grand designs. Of humble origins, he arrived in India as a
teenager, and like many such teenagers, his prime goal was to acquire a
fortune. This he did, only to lose it and sail East again. Luckily, he was
noticed in the right places, ending up by 1772 as governor of Bengal, soon
also becoming the Company’s first governor general. His place in imperial
history is high; where Clive ‘the mighty magician’ took the British flag to
the ‘temple of victory’ at Plassey, it was Hastings, we read, ‘that gave it a
foundation and its strength’. [99] And yet, the region he was to govern was in
ruins. British policies and corruption had fractured the economy. The
Company was in debt, moreover (Rs 10 million locally [100] ), and where
Clive had promised his bosses ‘a clear yearly revenue of two millions
sterling’, the actual math was sobering. [101] Additionally, the land was
drained to tip the British government also, which since 1767 demanded a


-----

share of the pickings. [102] Indians too, it must be admitted, participated in
this despoliation—bankers and tax farmers made massive gains. Their job
was to deliver a definite sum to the treasury, while pocketing any surplus;
and this they toiled hard to extort. The result was that while individuals
prospered, Bengal suffered. [103] As was reported less than a decade after the
British takeover, this country, ‘which flourished [even] under the most
despotic’ nawabi regime, had been steered to famine by its new, supposedly
more civilised white rulers. [104]

When Hastings took over, his effort, then, was to clean up this mess, ‘as

wild as chaos itself’. [105] Reportedly, he became a one-man army, inspecting
and correcting everything, to convert a muddy business venture into a
public administration. In the process, the new governor alienated his own
officers, many of whom did not share his sympathies, and were outraged
when reforms chipped at their illicit operations. [106] Some of his official
council blocked him, while a newspaper editor was jailed for scurrilous
attacks, including an opinion suggesting Hastings had erectile dysfunction.
107 Meanwhile, with pervasive economic stress, control looked precarious;
the last thing our man wanted was to be at odds with Bengal’s people. [108]

He certainly showed a warmer attitude towards them: Where some would
learn to revile the Bengali as ‘feeble’, wielding ‘falsehood, chicanery,
perjury, [and] forgery’ as his weapons, [109] Hastings described a ‘gentle,
benevolent’, ‘faithful and affectionate’ people. [110] To keep them happy, he
aimed to fashion a system as Indian as possible—a view at variance with


-----

the writer Alexander Dow’s, for instance, who had argued that such an
approach would breed ‘anarchy and confusion’. [111] So in the end, he chose
compromise: While he would rule like ‘an Indian and not as an alien’,
Hastings acknowledged the practical necessity that any administrative
machinery he created must also be of a kind ‘that English officials could
operate and English opinions tolerate’. [112] And to engineer this hybrid—
Indian enough to please its subjects but comprehensible to its (white)
masters as well—this man from Gloucestershire set out to procure
knowledge.

Understanding the ‘natives’, though, was a herculean mission. For while

the goal of economic extraction was clear, confusion reigned when it came
to summing up the millions of people at the giving end of the process; in
Bengal, we first observe the sustained effect of colonialism on Hindu
society, and of India on British minds. Decades later, an official surveying
local groups could still report no neat, unambiguous labels. In Bengal and
Bihar, Muslims had ‘recourse to the idols’, while Hindus were ‘addicted’ to
venerating Muslim divines—the opposite of what one might expect. [113]

Identity was befuddling: A Brahmin rajah might have a Muslim son, [114]

while a family raised boys as Hindu but girls for Islam. [115] Brahmins,
romanticized by the likes of de Nobili and Voltaire as noble scholars—and
disparaged by missionaries as wicked idol priests—could in general be
neither: They worked as farmers and traders and a large number wielded
arms, ‘ignorant’ of sectarian loyalties. [116] Indeed, these last ate meat and
smoked tobacco, challenging bookish ideas of propriety, [117] and some
groups carried Islamic influences even. [118] Nor was there geographical
uniformity for a caste’s status: If in Bengal, potters were ritually ‘clean’, in
Bihar, they were not; ‘barbers ( _nai_ ), who in Bengal are so haughty’, were
‘reduced to the rank of impurity’ next door. [119] Despite formal doctrines of
equality, caste existed among Muslims too. [120] (Indeed, there had been
Muslim kings in India who claimed descent from Hindu epic heroes. [121] )
From the start then, the British were in for disorientation; they had to shape
policy when they could barely grasp whom these were serving. The result


-----

was, as we have seen before, a skewed perception of reality—and of what
the ‘natives’ expected and cherished. Except now it came backed by state
power and gubernatorial righteousness. Where the Portuguese had ruled by
the sword, the British, it seemed, would smother with (misaimed) affection.

And yet, Hastings’s convictions notwithstanding, there was a peevish

discomfort with Indians among most British. For Company servants had no
resources—psychological included—for a serious immersion in Bengali
society. Most of them tended to minimize interaction, relying on
intermediaries instead, and acquiescing in what a Mughal writer called
‘half-knowledge’—precisely why a later generation represented by Munro
and his peers, urged better contact. [122] When the same Mughal critic asked
why, unlike their Indian priors, the British were allergic to open durbars
with the public, for instance, the answer he received is revealing. They were
not ‘accustomed’, his white discussant admitted, to meeting subjects face to
face; instead, they worked better ‘in the recess and silence of a closet’,
studying petitions. [123] In other words, the Company Raj was a detached
reign of paper—a mark also of its nervousness, separating it from the
society it governed. [124] Even after Hastings’s efforts, in fact, it was patent
that ‘English Gentlemen . . . hate appearing in public audiences’, and that
they betrayed ‘extreme uneasiness, impatience, and anger’ with brown
crowds. [125] Local rulers, the historian Jon Wilson notes, governed through
familiarity, face to face; [126] now, in this reign of merchants, government
was depersonalized. The world outside was so daunting to Bengal’s new
masters, that most chose to stay cloistered behind desks, inside cavernous
offices where they felt more in control; it was ‘natives’ who were forced to
navigate the new floor plan. ‘A whole life,’ the Mughal writer sighed, ‘is
needed to attend [the Company’s] long, very long [bureaucratic]
proceedings.’ [127]

Indeed, within twenty years of British rule, brown voices had diagnosed

its defects, chief among which—despite the stated surplus of good
intentions—was an absence of meaningful dialogue with Indians. Previous
rulers like the Mughals began as foreign conquerors too; but they, our critic
argued, with a dose of wistful romanticism, settled among the people,
Muslims mixing with Hindus ‘like milk and sugar that have received a
simmering’. [128] In contrast, white men ‘shew for the company of the
natives’ an ‘aversion’, instead of ‘love’ and ‘coalition’. [129] Strangers they
were when they seized Bengal, and strangers they stayed afterwards too—
and by definition, a stranger sought ‘his own profit’. [130] So too the Mughal
writer realized that it was the ‘diversity of customs and institutions’ that
intimidated the Company; and in seeking to rule without unravelling this


-----

lay ‘the origin of those troubles and those confusions that have been . . . the
bane and ruin of the inhabitants’. [131] Worse still, the corporate character of
British authority puzzled Bengalis: Power was exercised not by a king or
dynasty that might develop an emotional stake in the land but by a
‘numerous body’, with impermanent members seeking transient benefit.
Bengal was like a house with no master, only parasitic tenants. [132]

Governors came from a far-off island, and then left; there was no true
commitment. A Hastings might make overtures, but under a successor,
policy could (and did) tilt in a new direction. [133] So, in the end, a good part
of British administration was improvisation: a shuffling about to balance
commercial advantages with the moral pressure to govern; a contest
between making money and trying to care about a people with whom these
merchant–rajahs saw little in common.

Several of these defects surfaced in Hastings’s effort—and those of his

successors—to delineate ‘Hindu law’. One the one hand, he was hostile to
importing Western legal codes as urged in some quarters, thinking it safest
to leave Indians to their traditional devices. But he sought to achieve this
with a slate that was the opposite of blank. That is, even as the governor
general avoided European codes, he could not help but cast a European
_gaze_ upon Indian society. After all, Hastings was a product of the
Enlightenment. Hindus, he argued, were not ‘sunk in the grossest brutality’
when it came to faith. Their idolatry was, he sniffed, ‘coarse’, but textual
‘precepts of their religion’ ventured close to the ‘refined mysteries’ of the
Bible. [134] In tune with this textualist approach, actual legal systems in
Bengal were, to Hastings, not reflective of the great Hindu legal _tradition_ ,
one that ‘continued unchanged from the remotest antiquity’. [135] And so, as a
well-meaning alien, he would aim for a ‘renewal of the laws and forms
established of old’, which had been ‘corrupted and distorted’—an attitude,
as we saw in the previous chapter, Western intellectuals applied to Indian
culture in general. [136] Hastings’s ambition, that is, was to resurrect ‘original
principles’, to help manage a complex reality. [137] In part also to keep
lobbies urging anglicization at bay, he therefore transmitted the idea of a


-----

timeless Hindu constitution ‘buried under the weight of history’, waiting to
be reenergized by Europeans. [138] But in the end, the governor general
would not retrieve anything; in fact, he invented a mongrel, ‘native’ in
cosmetic terms, Western in shape and consequence. And far from clarifying
things, its great culmination was a muddle, the damage scarring
generations.

To start with, what was ‘Hindu law’? The fact is that there was no unitary

article of this name, everything being determined by context: region, caste,
community, economic background, etc. There were Hindus, yes, but no
single Hindu code. Thus, even twentieth-century Hindu gurus handling
questions on, say, marriage, deferred to _desachara_ (local custom). [139] And
with reason. The ancient law code, the _Yajnavalkya-smriti_ , for example,
warns that fathers with unmarried post-pubescent daughters incur sin
equivalent to foeticide. [140] But among Kerala’s orthodox Namboodiri
Brahmins, women traditionally remained ‘unmarried without any social
stigma’ well into adulthood. [141] Why? Because _local_ conditions, stemming
from historical contingencies in _this_ part of India, necessitated delays. So,
where the _Yajnavalkya-smriti_ might ‘speak’ to other Brahmins, in Kerala, it
had no voice in this matter. And both practices were valid—only for
different sets of people. [142] For Sanskrit books were never interpreted
literally. [143] They were a ‘theoretical source of law’, while ‘maxims and
customs’ were ‘paramount’. [144] Indeed, the texts—blending law, religion,
morality, ethics, and sociopolitical and cultural ideas—likely themselves
began as compilations of maxims ‘floating’ about in diverse parts, so that
the same authority might offer contradictory prescriptions. [145] To choose,
Hindus simply placed the issue in context. What was law for a group or
province might not fly in another; what was right for a litigant could be
abhorrent for the one after—a natural state in a pluralistic society. [146] To
illustrate, in the Deccan, drinking was tolerated with lower classes, but
upper-caste men were penalized for their liquid transgressions. Status here
fixed standards: A tipsy priest—who had a loftier role in society—was not
judged on the same plane as a drunk farmhand. [147]


-----

Given, however, that Hastings personified a world view in which

‘genuine’ Hindu ideas could only exist in ancient _sastra_ s (normative texts),
legal reality, like religion, was largely viewed as a distortion. This when
really it was the sastras that led a rarefied life. They never represented
Hindu society in full, being an ‘ideologically driven’ (Brahminical)
‘blueprint for the proper management of society’. [148] With glorious
inconsistency, they offered Brahmin-approved _options_ for various concerns.
149 And if, as with many such writings, these works claimed to be universal
and sacrosanct—a claim British minds, desperate to know India, would buy
—it was largely just that: an assertion. [150] For most Hindus did not live by
lawbooks in a language few could read. [151] As a French father related in
1714, there were ‘neither codes nor digests’ among Tamils, for instance.
There were ‘inviolable’ customs, though, and if anyone showed a case as
‘based on a custom . . . within the caste’, that was adequate. Yes, in some
cases, Brahmins were consulted, but custom ‘prevails over the best
arguments’. [152] Similarly, officials found female infanticide rampant among
Rajputs up north, due to debilitating dowry practices. But so much for
sastric authority, no amount of quoting condemnatory Sanskrit passages
terminated the violence. [153] Again, when nineteenth-century officials
hunting for a ‘code’ on succession and adoption sent questionnaires to five
Rajput princes, four responded with conflicting answers—the fifth only
spared everyone further confusion by ignoring the missive. Pressing on, by
1848, a book called _The Law of Adoption in Rajput States_ did appear. Its
author had to admit, however, that this did _not_ resemble ‘Hindu law’. Only
in the 1870s was it conceded that Rajput customs were ‘unwritten and
uncertain’. [154] That is, the law was dynamic territory—as in Britain—not
ideas inscribed in granite by long-dead sages awaiting European
resuscitation. [155]

This, in fact, was the norm across the subcontinent. In the 1820s, an

official surveying fifty-six castes in the Deccan concluded, thus, that they
had ‘no written documents or books to which they refer’. ‘Ancient usage’
dominated, and only in cases of ‘extraordinary difficulty’ were sastras


-----

introduced. [156] Indeed, local norms ‘sanctioned many things in _opposition_
to the Sastru [sic]’. [157] Even in Kerala, where Brahminical authority was
strong, no one could tell ‘where [Sastra] ends and local practice begins’, the
two being entwined in a peculiar knot. [158] Ideas from here could not simply
be replicated in Bihar, for example. [159] In the realm of the (Brahmin)
Peshwas of Poona too, while ‘a conformity of the written law’ was
‘preferable’, it was ‘not considered necessary’. [160] Did this mean legal
anarchy? No, for the system was robust enough for a judge in 1773 to
sentence the Peshwa himself. [161] These native courts even took cognizance
of marital rape, unrecognized in present-day India, where it is, ironically,
seen as a Western concept. [162] Besides, as some Tamils said to that French
missionary, if the law resided in books, ‘only the learned’ would know
them; handed down orally, ‘everyone is fully informed’. Indeed, the very
fact that ‘it is not necessary to write them down’ was ‘proof of their validity
and authority’. [163] In other words, written laws were more a _colonizer’s_
need; locals knew their way and showed no great tenacity. [164] Looking in
from the outside—and with much nervousness—the British sought ‘order’,
while those living in India already possessed a familiar, evolving system;
from their perch, they already had ‘order’.

Previous imperial powers like the Mughals had trodden cautiously, in

fact, preferring a hands-off approach. For example, a seventeenthcentury missionary travelling in Bengal discovered one day that a Muslim [165]
attendant had killed a peacock—a bird sacred to Hindus. While together
they disposed of the evidence—by burying the feathers and making a quick
meal of the flesh—the crime was soon detected. Dragged before a state
functionary, the missionary offered the defence that as a ‘follower of [the]
Prophet’, the Muslim accused had no cause to respect the Hindus’
‘ridiculous precepts’. The answer he received is instructive. The Mughal
officer endorsed Islam’s superiority. And yet, Hindus were promised they
could ‘live under their own laws and customs’. So, there would be
punishment. While bribes to the official’s wife softened things—from
amputation to whipping—ultimately, a Muslim man, trying another


-----

Muslim, was led not by abstract principles or theory but by the region’s
Hindu conventions. [166] He even asked of the men: ‘How . . . didst thou dare
in a _Hindu_ district to kill a living thing?’ [167] The point was that elsewhere,
where Muslims dominated, perhaps peacock murders could be forgiven, but
in _this_ region they were sin. [168] Indeed, it wasn’t even the case that justice
was dispensed at all times by the same authorities. For Indians ‘lived in
several penal jurisdictions’: of king, village, caste, guild and so on—no one
asserted a monopoly. [169] Legal matters were settled by a constellation,
including local strongmen, caste unions and village panchayats, besides
other scattered institutions. [170] In most matters, as a Company official later
confirmed, Indians were ‘ready to abide by what four impartial men may
think right’. [171] And while Brahmins and texts were involved, they were
only _a_ factor, not _the_ factor as many white men came to insist. [172]

Of course one must watch against romanticizing the existing system; it

had flaws that will scandalize modern sensibilities. [173] Trials by ordeal, for
instance—where parties stuck their hands into boiling oil and won if they
were unscalded—could not have been terribly reliable in settling property
disputes. [174] So also, as Ziegenbalg was told, the rich settled matters
through fines, while the poor suffered full punishment. [175] And yet, a
preference for arbitration and quick settlement kept things more efficient
than the bureaucratic confusion the British installed. With his great desire to
be accommodative, Hastings, for example, decided that in ‘all suits
regarding inheritance, marriage, caste, and other religious usages . . . the
law of the Koran with respect to Mahometans [Muslims] and those of the

[sastras] with respect to Gentoos [Hindus] shall be invariably adhered to’.
176 Superficially this was ‘traditional’; except that ‘Muslims in Bengal

[being] Hindu converts . . . often continued to use local Hindu law’, [177] and
it was no aberration to find a Hindu judge in courts governed on Islamic
principles either. [178] Hastings was even told that among Hindus, ‘[e]ach
separate Tribe has its own distinct . . . Laws’. [179] And yet, to assuage
colonial anxieties, he enshrined a strange cross-breed. Texts referred to by a
minority of Hindus were repackaged as the ‘law’ of its totality; legal


-----

traditions limited to scholarly Brahmins were now deployed as the primary
means to read ‘Hindu law’ in toto. [180] And if anyone was wrong, it was
Hindus who had become ‘universally ignorant of their canonical learning’
and so ‘lax’ that Enlightened foreigners had to intervene. [181] Instead of
dealing with Hindus in the present, that is, the white man yet again herded
them into a synthetic ‘classical’ past. [182] Or to quote a future critic, ‘no
voices were heard unless they came from the tomb. It was as if a German
were to administer English law from the resources of a library furnished
with Fleta, Glanville, and Bracton, and terminating with Lord Coke’. [183]

This is not to say that eighteenth-century Hindu states did not make

similar experiments. The Peshwa regime in Poona, for instance, tried
repeatedly to persuade Brahmins—of various subcastes—to live by its own
centralized sastric readings. One man, for example, who had become a
Muslim, was re-Brahminized in 1772 by a caste council. The Peshwa’s
government, however, objected. Though resisted for years, it finally had its
way, prevailing over local customary prerogatives. As the Marathas took
territories in Malwa, here too the Peshwas launched a ‘moral mission’,
aiming to ‘revive’ ‘proper customs’ for local Brahmins. One roll of
instructions, thus, features forty-eight items on everything from appropriate
clothing to acceptable jobs. Brahmins, it was ordered, thus, must cease
doing menial labour; all boys must study the Vedas and so on. [184] Yet, these
attempts had had limits and were somewhat different. The Peshwas—
themselves Brahmins—had a special incentive in promoting orthodox
norms, envisioning a ‘rule by, for and of the Brahmins’; their approach
cannot be assumed as the norm for most Hindu rulers. [185] Besides,
Brahmins themselves resisted centralized Peshwa-era innovations. [186]

Riding roughshod over custom provoked violence too. Once when thieves
apprehended in an area were tried at the Peshwa’s capital, the local chief
had state functionaries thrashed for trespassing on _his_ magisterial rights. [187]

Ultimately, that is, ‘natives’ engaged with a variety of stakeholders; and
orthodox norms, even when promoted, were tempered by reality. Where


-----

local rulers had the cultural resources to negotiate this process, the
Company, as an alien entity, flailed. [188]

To truly recognize law among Hindus, the British would have had to

draw on invisible norms, that is. And this being tough, a monolithic,
Western-style textual reading of ‘tradition’ became their standard. Indeed,
with Hastings convinced that there were Brahmin ‘professors’ of an
‘unchanged’ law ‘spread over the whole empire of Hindostan’, [189] a
Company servant was tasked with creating a digest. This would give both
‘confidence to the people’ and white judges guidance. [190] The result was
Nathaniel B. Halhed’s _A Code of Gentoo Laws_ (1776). Its preparation was


-----

convoluted. Halhed knew Persian but was hopeless in Sanskrit. Eleven
Brahmin ‘lawyers’ were summoned from ‘every Part of Bengal’, then, to
translate into Persian ‘Sentence by Sentence’ content ‘from various
Originals’. [191] Halhed then produced his _Code_ , hoping to win ‘the
Affections of the Natives’ and ‘ensure Stability’. [192] Inadvertently, however,
he admitted the limited resonance of the code: This was the first time
‘Bramins have ever been persuaded to give up a Part of their own
Consequence for the general Benefit of the whole Community.’ [193] While
neither man urged a rigid fidelity to texts yet—only providing, in English,
an exemplar for white judges—in practice, things evolved differently. And
what they set off would, within years, mutate into something unwieldy,
frustrating even their countrymen. Or in the words of a future judge,
assuming that predatory tribes, trader castes and cultivators could be guided
by a single code was as foolish as suggesting their lives revolved around the
Psalms of David. [194] In retrospect, as the Company grew in strength and
awareness of Hindu realities, this seemed obvious. But in the eighteenth
century, policy was often conjecture with a deceptive varnish.

Interestingly, ‘natives’ were able to adjust somewhat at first. For even as

British judges unduly emphasized Sanskrit verse over custom, they relied
on Brahmin pandits. [195] And pandits—Hindus living among Hindus—even
if they ‘tortured’ texts to fit British standards, managed to bridge them with
the people’s ways. So far, ‘no great harm was done’. But then, in a postHastings age, British attitudes changed, undermining ‘native’ participation. [196]
197 In the 1790s, a growing reluctance to depend on brown intermediaries
saw a prominent judge learn Sanskrit. Convinced that pandits were
deceiving him, he published a _Digest of Hindu Law_ to prevent other white
men from being ‘led astray’. [198] That is, the way Hindus creatively
reconciled text with practice—as was always done and which only men
reared in a culture could do—looked, to an anxious foreign power, sinister.
So, while some judges continued to depend on pandits, many began to
interpret and apply ‘Hindu law’ themselves. Except this was more
formulaic. If at all Brahmins were consulted, it was by posing abstract


-----

questions, without evidence or details of the specific case—like asking an
English lawyer to opine on murder, without explaining if it was an act in
self-defence or voluntary manslaughter. [199] Besides, lack of historical
knowledge generated problems: For years, the courts merrily applied
‘Hindu law’ to Sikhs and Jains, because they had not yet worked out that
these groups were not exactly Hindu. [200] And over time, the damage spread:
In the 1810s, a Travancore officer, for example, unearthed texts. His
intention too was to standardize law while maintaining a façade of
‘tradition’; to construct a system Hindus would not think _completely_ alien,
but which aliens like him could grasp—and control. [201] All this when he
was aware that the written sources he was building on were ‘seldom
consulted’. [202]

Eventually, then, ‘Hindu law’ became less about Hindus, more about

white men and their apprehensions. [203] And critics lamented the problems
this triggered: that Mughal writer related how, even in general
administration, obsessed with ‘Books and Memorandums’, the Company
routinely mistook ‘the exterior and bark’ for the ‘pith’. [204] Or as the scholar
Purushottam Agrawal put it, the British did not ‘cut the cloth to fit the body’
but ‘cut the body to fit the cloth’. [205] By 1807, it was reported how the
‘native who has a good cause always applies for a panchayat; while he who
has a bad one, seeks the decision of a . . . [British] Judge’ because the
system was twisted enough to let the wrong party win. [206] So too in 1821, a
London officer described ‘Hindu law’ as farce. The British had gone
‘astray’, legislating ‘before they were acquainted with the real state’ of
things. [207] Far from reinstating order, the Company peddled anachronism: If
Hindus objected to summoning women to court, for example, what was the
point of putting up Sanskrit verses showing that ‘in another part of India,
two thousand years ago’ women stood in the dock? ‘How could we
presume,’ it was asked, ‘to embody in a Code the various usages of so many
millions of different rules and Castes?’ As for fetishizing texts: ‘did
Socrates write . . . did our Saviour write?’ To label Indians ‘semibarbarians’ who could ‘not even understand [their] own language and


-----

system’ was not proof of their decline, but of British ‘bigotry . . . pride, and
. . . vanity’. [208] In fact, such frustrations were recycled as late as the 1870s:
‘Hindu Law’ was, a judge grumbled, a ‘phantom’, and court decrees
‘grossly unjust’. [209] Another protested the ‘grotesque absurdity’ of applying
Brahminical norms to people with little to do with them. But at ‘this late
day’, he was compelled to stick to the travesty anyway. [210]

And so, Hastings’s mongrel powered on even when exposed. [211] The man

had been sincere in seeking to govern in accordance with ‘native’ ideas, but
ultimately his legal framework offered not justice but a queer convenience
—to the British at any rate. [212] In the century ahead, many officials
continued stubbornly to compile guides to make sense of the mess, all along
insisting they were honouring ‘tradition’. Or in the words of one innovator,
while ‘Hindoo law’ was ‘unintelligible’, the British had a ‘duty’ to identify
‘beneficial’ bits, and through ‘undeviating application to cases’,
_manufacture_ consistency. In so doing, they might ‘cleanse the system of its
aggregated corruptions’, and ‘defecate the impurity of the ages’. [213] Again,
clumsy white men masqueraded as saviours to the brown; again, to borrow
from our Mughal critic, they reduced ‘natives’ from a living, breathing
people to ‘pictures on a wall’. [214] Naturally, the latter too had responses.
And not unlike general British uncertainty in this period, these too initially
oscillated between profitable acquiescence and small subversions. It was as
if all parties involved were still taking stock of one another. Only when the
Company’s attitude stiffened—as we will see—with sober voices being
replaced by more hard-line, evangelical thinking, did Hindus turn militant
in their opposition. Errors the Portuguese made in Goa the British would
begin to commit at a more sophisticated, but no less offensive, scale. And
with accommodation—plus the desire for it—fraying, Hindus would resort
to a nationalism defined by the one thing their foreign rulers could never
partake of with them: religion. [215]

Peshwa Bajirao II as depicted in an 1888 lithograph, from the Wellcome Collection.

In 1805, a Bombay judge called on the man fated to be the last Peshwa of
the Marathas. Writing later, he described his host as ‘the handsomest Hindu
I have seen’, albeit ‘with more elegance than dignity’. In fact, added James
Mackintosh, ‘no lady’s hands, fresh from the toilet and the bath, could be
more clean than his uncovered feet’. [216] And yet, Bajirao II (1775–1851)
was no effeminate nonentity. His capital was home to 1,00,000 people,
making it smaller than London but greater than New York. [217] Poona hosted
feared Arab guards, while an American led another body of troops. The
Peshwa served Chinese tea at his court, where nearly 5000 clerks managed
his business. [218] And yet, all the pomp and circumstance failed to mask
Bajirao’s vulnerability: The great Maratha satraps were against him, forcing
him sometime before to quit his capital and seek British protection. [219]

Evidently, he was unpopular with his people also—once asking that they
turn ‘joy’ at his accession into payment of a happiness tax [220] —and


-----

apportioned his time between ‘religious rites in public’ and ‘sensual
enjoyment in private’. [221] But, as often happened, the white man’s embrace
proved more trying than unruly brown subordinates. So, by 1817, as those
very satraps rallied against the Company for a clash, Bajirao joined in, now
becoming ‘a public enemy of the British government’. [222] Bloodshed
followed and terrible battles were fought, until the Maratha effort
floundered. Once again, the Peshwa fled Poona—this time fearing English
guns. [223] As a song from the period rues, ‘The Shrimant [Bajirao], brought
up in the delicacies of the palace, is now roaming through forests.’ [224] One
presumes his feet lost some of their lustre.

Ultimately, after seven months on the run, the Peshwa surrendered. It was

the end of the man and the institution he represented as he was exiled to a
faraway village in the north. In prestige, Bajirao suffered: When he
requested guns for ceremonial use, the British sent him two scrapyard
pieces, one of which tended to backfire. [225] Materially, however, he
received some consolation—his pension was substantial enough not only to
allow great comforts but also for the ex-Peshwa to become creditor to his
own captors, the Company. [226] He also led an eventful domestic life;
married six times already, in exile he took five fresh wives. [227] And this
way, Bajirao would spend decades in luxurious obscurity. Of course, he
remained under surveillance. For the British still suspected the Peshwa of
seeking to undermine them, now via seditious contacts in Nepal, next by
tacitly backing rebels. No convincing proof emerged, but the Company
forever viewed Bajirao with concern. For his part too, the man withheld all
legitimacy from the British. Yes, on the face of it, there was cordiality:
When an officer, with whom he got on went to bid farewell at the end of his
posting, the Peshwa ‘shed tears’. But then the fallen premier of the
Marathas said something interesting: that he would pray to his Hindu gods
for the white man to appear as a Brahmin in his next birth. For this way, he
would gain a shot at salvation. [228] One might read an interesting subtext in
this: that no matter how amiable a Company man was, no matter how he
befriended ‘natives’, ultimately there was only one way the British could


-----

cease being strangers—they would need new bodies and brown skins. To
become masters of the Hindus, even the best of men had to be born Hindu.

But while those disenfranchised by Company rule had reason to hate it,

there were more than a few willing to work with the hat-wearers—much
like those sky-faring gandharvas at the start of this chapter were divided in
their views. Thus, ironically, British imperialism in India saw also the rise
of a Brahmin collaborator class, serving and aiding the conqueror. In a
sense, the Company here followed a pattern set by modernizing Indian
states. As kingdoms transitioned from fragmented systems—where rulers
shared power with warlords and diffused institutions—into centralized
entities, bureaucracies became critical. In Kerala for example, the
Travancore rajah crushed his warrior nobility by the mid-eighteenth
century, importing Brahmins from Tamil country to run his government. [229]

Pen-wielding mercenaries, they were loyal to the king, while their
preeminent caste status offered protection. [230] Persian-speaking Telugu
Brahmins, similarly, had served the Carnatic nawab, [231] and in the
seventeenth century, the last Golconda sultan was the instrument of two
Brahmins, leading an increasingly Brahmin secretariat. [232] As early as the
sixteenth century, in fact, a Vijayanagara emperor had advocated this
formula: to cultivate mobile Brahmin professionals in ‘all departments’ over
hereditary strongmen, who, with their autonomous power bases, tested the
centre. [233] For their part, while some Brahmins resented having to kowtow
to questionable political masters, [234] the worldly-wise adapted. Even with
Europeans, thus, men spoke of ‘the Brahmin of so-and-so’, which meant
‘bookkeeper or representative’, [235] and in mid-seventeenth-century Madras,
we already find Brahmin officials wielding extraordinary influence. [236]

With the conquest or subordination of ‘native’ states, the Company now

scaled up this trend. Maratha expansion in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries had allowed Deccan Brahmins access to many parts of the
subcontinent. [237] For instance, one family served Mughal governors in the
south; later, a son became treasury master to Tipu in Mysore and after the
sultan’s fall, was appointed regent of that state by the British. [238] Even in


-----

areas which the Company trounced but did not annex, it placed trusted
Brahmins in executive posts. Travancore, for instance, saw half-a-dozen
British-backed Brahmins awarded its ministership by 1857—and the man
who followed for the next fourteen years was nephew to one from the
previous batch. [239] Though the people here spoke Malayalam, records were
translated into Marathi—a language as foreign as English—for these
ministers’ convenience. [240] In Pudukkottai, the Company embedded so
many outsiders, that fifty years later, imported Brahmins’ ‘paramount
influence’ remained a cause of ‘universal complaint’. [241] That is, the
‘foreigner’ in these contexts was not only the white man but also his
Brahmin aide; Company Raj also enabled a Brahmin Raj. In directly held
territories in south India too, by the mid-nineteenth century, Brahmins
supplied ‘a majority of _sheristidar_ s (head clerks) in the revenue offices’ [242]

and in a single district, one such ensconced seventy-four relatives in plum
positions. [243] Why, observing this mutually beneficial concord, a British
officer declared the empire ‘the wonder of the world’. For if the ‘native
soldiery’ spilled its blood in battle, ‘men of the priesthood’ showed a
matching clerical ‘devotion’—all for ‘a strange race sitting in the seat of the
rulers’. [244] The wonder would not last though: In time, Brahmins would
become leading promoters of nationalism in India.

Either way, just as the Company had divergent voices within, Indian

responses too were not uniform at this stage. The Bengali Brahmins who
aided Halhed with his _Code_ on ‘Hindu law’, are a case in point. In 1774,
even as the _Code_ was being prepared, Halhed composed a poem in which a
‘care-worn Bramin’ sits ‘silent and sad’ by the Ganga, tracing ‘his country’s
progress to decay’. ‘Weak man’, thunders the river goddess; ‘Rouse from
this torpid lethargy of mind’. For the glorious British had destroyed the
‘bigot zeal’ of ‘spoilers’ like the Mughals. She next berates ‘Ingrateful
Hindus’ for not recognizing the white man’s ‘tender hand’ which ‘Pours
balm into your wounds’. These new rulers had restored ‘your country’s
laws’ and ‘the slighted Vedas’; they had ‘deliver’d [Hindus] from a tyrant’s
chain’. So, the Brahmin’s duty was not to whine about India’s decay but to


-----

show ‘glad homage’. [245] Almost as if in agreement, in their preface to the
_Code_ , the Brahmins expressed similar feelings. Of course, on the one hand,
like their peers who had been debating Christian missionaries, they
defended Hinduism. There was no one way to know god, for he ‘appointed
to each Tribe its own Faith’. [246] And so, sometimes, he manifested in ‘the
Mosque, in counting the sacred Beads’, sometimes ‘in the Temple, at the
Adoration of Idols’. This much stated, however, they validated the _Code_ . In
days of yore, it was announced, the Hindu religion was ‘catholick and
universal’, till it was ‘ravaged’ by ‘the Armies of Mahomedanism’—an
early voicing of what is the cornerstone of Hindu nationalist history today.
The ‘Laws of Mahomed [became] the Standard of Judgment’—a
historically unsound claim—breeding ‘Terror and Confusion’. Until, that is,
‘a Thought suggested itself to the Governor General’, to rescue the ‘Gentoo
Religion’. [247] In other words, yes, the British were protectors of Hinduism
itself. [248]

In fact, when Hastings later faced legal trouble in London, 112 Bengali

Brahmins couriered a memorandum in his defence. Under him, it was
recorded, they were ‘richly blessed’, as ‘he endeavoured’ for ‘the promotion
of our well-being and for the maintenance of our honour’. Indeed, Hastings
‘cherished us’ like ‘children’. [249] Pandits from Benares were equally warm:
Hastings had not only brought fame to the government but delivered
‘comfort’ to its subjects. ‘And all of us . . . offer our prayers for the
prosperity of the . . . empire of the King and the Company, who are a
veritable repository of never-failing kindness.’ [250] Among some men at
least, then, the British, despite foreign roots and Christian origins, were
viewed as new rajahs; for just some time, the kind of policy men like


-----

Malcolm advocated looked like it might work. For worldly Brahmins too,
this was not radical—they could come to terms with white men as they once
had the Mughals. Their very presence in Company offices demonstrated a
knack for survival. In a marble statue of Hastings, for example, we see the
ex-governor general in a toga, posing like a Roman legislator. To his left, at
a lower level, a Muslim maulvi pores over a Persian book. But to Hastings’s
right, stands a Brahmin. He has palm-leaf manuscripts in one hand, while
the other is raised to his chin, as he gazes upon the ground, lost in thought.
It is as if he cannot make up his mind, juxtaposed between a squatting
Persian master and the faux-Roman conqueror. The context is new but also
holds opportunity. And for better or worse, the Brahmin was in that spot—
and he would have to live with it. [251]

One might argue that as beneficiaries of British rule, these Hindus had

reason to air positive views. Besides, as Brahmins they might have been
pleased by the attention the new dispensation gave their texts and traditions.
252 Hindus of _political_ backgrounds—pressed by the Company’s might—
struggled, however. ‘Hindu law’, for instance, benefitted the Company in
statecraft. Brahminical theory recognized kingship only for Kshatriyas—the
second of the four ‘classical’ caste groups. But Indian princes were often
descended from the peasantry; Kshatriyahood was _negotiated_ and acquired.
Armed with hardboiled textualism though, the British could declare Hindu
rulers bogus: the issue of ‘needy adventurers’ and ‘lucky farmers’. Toppling
them was not, this way, unjust. [253] An early case comes from Tanjore. In the
1780s, a new rajah succeeded as per custom and precedent. But he was not
submissive. Sensing opportunity, a rival claimant’s faction demanded the
man back his title with ‘proof from the Shasters’. [254] Without irony, the

255
governor general placed this Maratha case from Tamil country before northIndian Brahmins, seeking ‘accurately quoted’ texts. So, even if the rajah
were backed by his ‘chief people’ and ‘general opinion’, [256] his status was
made reliant on book-wielding Brahmins of a different province. Indeed, it
was asked if his _own_ backers could quote ‘passages’ and prove ‘real
knowledge _’_ of Hindu law. [257] And soon, the British held the succession


-----

illegal, deposing the rajah; Tanjore pandits who disagreed were ‘ignorant or
corrupt’. [258] Simply put, the Company shrouded duplicity in malleable
legalese to do as it pleased. As an amazed Englishman wrote, ‘Brahmins
may be induced to sanction any wish of the British’; it was possible to find
in ‘Hindu law’ whatever suited the needs of power. [259]

The necessary—even natural—corollary to this attitude on the British

side was its manipulation by Indians. [260] This comes across in the case of a
rajah in Travancore in the opening decade of the nineteenth century. Hostile
to British influence in his state, with a lopsided treaty forced on him, he
supported rebels against the Company in 1809. The British won the day,
and so the rajah faced punishment—so vindictive, in fact, that his wife was
seized and put aside. Soon, the Company’s representative tried to foist a
new lady on the prince: sister of a minister loyal to them. However, the
rajah declared the act illegal. On the face of it, he had a point: The sastras
have rules he could hold against the annulment of his marriage. However,
the fact is that his particular dynasty was matrilineal: a local custom with
little reflection in texts. Marriage was _not_ a sacred bond, nor was it
indissoluble; polygamy and polyandry were permitted, and the rajah’s
_sister_ , not wife, was queen. But faced with British pressure, and aware of
the Company’s half-knowledge about ‘Hindu law’, the rajah’s advocates
read it to his advantage. They argued that he could never be separated from
his wife, nor a new one imposed; it was ‘forbidden’ by law—this when the
rajah’s predecessor had multiple wives, and no such ‘law’ counted. [261] In
the end, the rajah was reunited with his spouse. [262] The episode holds
lessons. For, as the anthropologist Bernard Cohn observed, the conquest of
India was as much a ‘conquest of knowledge’ as it was of land and goods.
263 And to pull on under colonial rule, Indians internalized even error,
shrewdly learning to exploit it for their own purposes. [264]

In fact, Hastings’s innovations too would unexpectedly come in handy

for Hindus. As we saw, brown men possessed overlapping, plural identities:
caste-based, sectarian, regional, linguistic, and, alongside these, the
religious. While this last had long existed—and thanks to Islamic rule,


-----

Hindus were conscious in degrees of their separateness from Muslims—the
legally enshrined colonial bifurcation of Indian society into two master
groups now allowed it a more concrete life. That is, where Hindus had
various forms of self-conception, sometimes in tension with one another,
the government’s approach empowered religion as an overarching, unifying
principle. What was a fuzzy, incomplete feeling received hereon a definite
impetus. Coupled in future with colonial censuses, Hindus would slowly
begin to conceive of themselves in a new manner. The British intended
enumerative exercises to help them ‘see’ India better; they ended up
enabling Indians to see _themselves_ in novel forms. With Hindus, thus, it was
established almost overnight that they comprised a numerical majority, as
against minorities like Muslims. [265] ‘Before head counts of people were
announced,’ we read ‘it was neither possible nor necessary for communities
across the land to identify themselves with any degree of preciseness and to
seek similarities or differences with others outside their immediate kin.’ [266]

Now, though, Hindu thinkers could focus more and more on what made
them a single grouping; to construct unity despite diversity. History,
knowledge and even the English language, would grow key to this, as the
next chapter will show. So much so that if Portuguese persecution in Goa
had been a local affair, it would eventually be perceived in national
accounts as an attack on subcontinental Hindus as a whole—as a people.

The British, in other words, might have viewed Hindus, to borrow that

line from our Mughal critic, like ‘pictures on a wall’. The latter, however,
subverting the same processes, would learn to portray themselves as a
nation awakening after long.

#### FOUR

 ‘AN INDIAN RENAISSANCE’

In the summer of 1826, the bishop of Calcutta arrived at the court of the
rajah of Tanjore in southern India. Reginald Heber had already travelled a
fair bit in the country by then, covering parts of upper India, and even
calling on the Mughal emperor in Delhi. The latter, the bishop recalled, was
dignified but all around this ‘poor old prince’ was decay and ruin as
matched his actuality as a pensioned-off relic. There was, of course, no
shortage of compensatory ceremony and valuable gifts were bestowed by
the king. But the palace was filthy, with even the hall where the Mughals
once sat in state ‘full of lumber of all descriptions, broken palanquins and
empty boxes’. The throne, in fact, was ‘so covered with pigeons’ dung that
its ornaments were hardly discernible’. [1] It was a foreshadowing of the fate
that awaited the descendants of Akbar the Great, who had once so amazed
visiting Jesuits. A haughty governor general had already declined to appear
before the emperor on the ground that protocol positioning the British as
Mughal vassals was now outdated. Indeed, by 1835, the king’s name would
be scratched off Company coins as well. Two decades later, after the Great
Rebellion (more on that in the next chapter), the last of the padshahs would
be toppled officially, paving the way for Queen Victoria to name herself
Kaiser-i-Hind, suzerain of India. What Heber saw in Delhi, then, were the
last trickles of old wealth and ‘native’ majesty; behind appearances, the
Mughal crown looked perfectly hollow.

In Tanjore, however, the bishop was pleasantly surprised. To begin with,

there was a mission at work here with a thriving community of Christians:
1300 Tamils attended a service where he was present. But the visitor had
also heard a good deal about the local Maratha rajah, noting with approval
after an audience how ‘I have seen many crowned heads, but not one whose
deportment was more princely.’ [2] This ruler, Heber reported, ‘quotes
Fourcroy, Lavoisier, Linnaeus, and Buffon fluently’, and had ‘a more
accurate judgement of the poetical merits of Shakespeare than those so


-----

felicitously expressed by Lord Byron’. Why, he even ‘emitted English
poetry’ of a ‘very superior’ variety, even as he was a ‘good judge of a horse,
and a cool, bold . . . shot at a tiger’. [3] It was ‘with the sincerest regret’ that
Heber took his leave, given that the place was ‘so favored and so full of
promise’—as he observed to a companion, ‘instead of the usual danger of
exaggerated reports and the expression of too sanguine hopes, the fault here
was that enough had _not_ been said’ about Tanjore. [4] An account of a second,
informal meeting requested by Heber before resuming his travels, in fact,
captures not only his animation but also a glimpse of the rajah’s material
and intellectual universe—a far cry from the rot so palpable in the house of
the Mughals.

The bishop paid a private visit to the rajah, who received us in his library—a noble room,
with three rows of pillars, and handsomely furnished in the English style. On one side
there are portraits of the Mahratta dynasty from Shahjee and Sivajee; ten book-cases,
containing a very fair collection of French, English, German, Greek, and Latin books, and
two others of Mahratta and Sanskrit manuscripts. In the adjoining room is an air-pump,

an electrifying machine, an ivory skeleton, [5] astronomical instruments, and several other
cases of books, many of which are on the subject of medicine, which was for some years

[the rajah’s] favorite study. He showed us his valuable collection of coins, paintings of
flowers, and natural history, with each of which he seemed to have considerable
acquaintance, particularly with the medicinal virtues of the plants in his _hortus siccus_ . . .
His stables contain several fine English horses, but that of which he is most justly proud,
as the rarest curiosity of an Indian court, is an English printing-press, worked by native
Christians, in which they struck off a sentence in Mahratta [sic] in the bishop’s presence,

in honor of his visit. [6]

Rajah Serfoji Bhonsle II of Tanjore (1777–1832) was used to glowing
reviews, not least because it was rather startling for white men to encounter
a Hindu prince surrounded by the outward appurtenances of European
modernity. Heber’s predecessor, for example, was certain that the rajah was
not just ‘a most accomplished Native Prince’ but also represented
something ‘new in India’. [7] Where the Mughal emperor’s throne, devastated
as much by British contempt as by pigeons, served as an artefact of expired
greatness, here was a seemingly virile mind, embracing the technological
and material promise of the West, matching also many cultural benchmarks.


-----

When Viscount Valentia, a British aristocrat, visited Tanjore in 1804, for
example, he was thrilled that the rajah spoke ‘very good English’, making
this one of those rare occasions when ‘I had been able to converse with a
native prince’ without interpreters. His palace was old but ‘handsome’, and
the rajah himself was a man of such excellent manners that ‘good nature
beams from his countenance’. A tour of the premises, including its famous
library, followed, and by the time he left, Valentia thought Serfoji an
unusual Hindu who ‘passes his life in a course of rational amusement and
study’, in contrast to ‘the generality of Asiatic princes, who are either slaves
to ambition, or sunk in the debauchery of the harem’. [8] Leaving aside the
cliché of Eastern depravity, which came so naturally to even the kindest
European voices, it was clear that on his Western visitors, Serfoji made a
most uncommon impression.

This had much to do with the circumstances in which the rajah was

installed in Tanjore—he was the very prince, described a few pages ago,
who won the succession by convincing the British of a stronger claim under
‘Hindu law’. Adopted in 1787 by the dying then-rajah, ten-year-old Serfoji
was meant to bypass the rajah’s brother. [9] But at the time, the Company
quite justly judged the adoption ‘irregular and deceptive’, and put him
aside. [10] However, soon the other candidate proved to be difficult, and here
Serfoji’s supporters sensed opportunity. ‘I see you as my parents,’ Serfoji
declared to the British, [11] asking that they ‘call me to Madras’. [12] His appeal
was granted, and at the Company’s southern headquarters, the boy was
exposed to European education, picking up fluency in English and meeting
everyone from Governor General Cornwallis to the sons of Tipu Sultan.
While traditional lessons continued, they were joined to a curiosity about
the West’s intellectual and scientific advances, and a lifelong addiction to
books. Meanwhile, his advocate, C.F. Schwartz (1726–98)—a missionary
connected to the Tranquebar Mission started by Ziegenbalg, and who had
been a friend of Serfoji’s adoptive father—pushed his claim to the throne. [13]

It was Schwartz who first raised the bogey of ‘Hindu law’ and the
incumbent rajah’s ineligibility according to those ‘translation[s] . . .


-----

published in Bengal’. [14] The effort bore fruit—when the imperialist Lord
Wellesley took charge, he deposed the ruler. [15] Lodging Serfoji in his stead,
he next obtained a transfer of Tanjore territory to the Company. Serfoji, of
course, was granted an abundant pension and he retained control of his fort
palace—not a bad bargain for a boy whose right to power was dubious. In
fact, his gratitude to Schwartz was such that decades after the missionary’s
death, he still referred to him as ‘father’. [16] The deposed rajah, meanwhile,
was exiled to a small town, where he died three years later, a parcel of
regrets.

Observing the fate of maharajahs whose lands were ‘assumed’ by the

British, a senior official would in time remark how ‘the loss of much of
their real power’ tended to make Indian princes ‘anxious to preserve forms
that yet remain of royalty’. [17] This typically took the form of religious
ceremony and acts of piety. Serfoji was no exception: One of his first deeds
was to eject British troops garrisoned in the eleventh-century Siva temple in
Tanjore, and having ritually purified it, to order renovations. [18] Tanjore was
once the seat of the medieval Chola emperors, and then the Nayaka dynasty
linked to Vijayanagara. Serfoji’s Maratha ancestors came here as agents of
an enemy sultan to assist the last of the Nayakas in a contest, only to
quickly seize the kingdom for themselves. Awkwardness about this lessthan-gallant ascent to power was papered over with poetry: It was claimed [19]
that Siva called on the first Maratha rajah in a dream, confirming his right
over Tanjore. [20] But another device to craft legitimacy was supporting the
temple and its patronage networks, much like the British would do with
Jagannath in Orissa. Serfoji, in fact, with power dissolved and his house a
shell of what it was, literally inscribed on the walls of the structure a
genealogy of the Marathas—a closing signature by a prince who understood
he and his kind were fast becoming history. [21] In that sense, he was enacting
a ‘traditional’ Hindu expression of kingship, anchored in religion and
dynastic glory.

But Serfoji was no tragic soul, seeking consolation in empty ritualism

and temple patronage. With the little authority left in him as master of a
single fort-city, and the monetary resources the British allotted him, the
rajah also inaugurated what has been called the ‘Tanjore Renaissance’ and
the ‘Tanjore Enlightenment’. It was, to quote a scholar, ‘a knowledgemaking process that combined indigenous wisdom with all that was [22]
relevant and useful’ in Western culture; it produced modern knowledge that
yet remained ‘rooted in tradition’. [23] That is, the rajah made a mark not as a
political being but as an innovative intellectual. For example, on the one
hand, Serfoji founded institutions for Vedic studies, meeting Brahmin ideals
of kingly conduct. But on the other, he also established twenty-one schools
offering free education of the European kind, albeit ‘disengaged from
Christian frames of reference’. [24] While years later, there would still be


-----

debates within the colonial establishment on whether vernacular or English
education ought to receive official backing, Serfoji—a rajah ‘with less
power than an English nobleman’ [25] —gave students instruction in five
languages: Tamil (of the masses), Marathi (of his court), Telugu (a
prestigious language from Vijayanagara’s heyday), Persian (favourite of the
Mughal order), and, of course, English (from India’s new overlords). [26] One
school, attached to an almshouse named after a beloved consort alone had
fifteen teachers and 464 pupils, with a Vedic _pathasala_ (academy) and
temple functioning in parallel. [27] All at once, that is, this brown prince
helmed a ‘native’ engagement with European modernity—a process, not
imposed by the British from above, but pursued with a measure of
autonomy.

These innovations were mastered by Serfoji in a period when Company

authorities in Madras were hesitant to support public instruction—in setting
up schools, the rajah was borrowing, in fact, from Christian missions, many
of which separately received his support too. Yet, he was also moulding
something new: Instead of using the usual highbrow term _sarva-vidyakalanidhi-salai_ (‘house for the study of all sciences and arts’), the palace
school was called the _nava-vidya-kalanidhi-salai_ (‘house of the study of
_new_ learning’), for example. [28] As with Christian mission institutions—and
here perhaps can be traced his mentor Schwartz’s influence—caste rules
were relaxed; orphans and disabled children were admitted; and food and
board provided to all in need of it. [29] Serfoji was equally conscious that in
an impoverished country, knowledge for its own sake would not go far—the
idea was to endow students with practical skills in gaining employment in
Company offices, including by providing access to languages of power.
Products of the Tanjore system would in time spread across southern India,
achieving distinction—one of the rajah’s aides, Subba Rao, was to not only
become author of the first English play written by an Indian, but also tutor
and then minister to the princes of Travancore: men who would themselves
acquire reputations as enlightened, modern rulers. [30] Moreover, the rajah
personally crafted textbooks, keeping them familiar to pupils in format,


-----

while also conveying new ideas absorbed from overseas. In its outer shell,
this was Hindu learning, but the yolk inside had a Western flavour. Only an
Indian well versed in European and ‘native’ ideas both could pull off
something like this; only a Serfoji could Indianize the white man’s
knowledge and smoothly blend it with local culture. [31]

An example appears in Serfoji’s adapted _kuravanji_ play format, which, as

the scholar Indira Viswanathan Peterson notes, was long popular in Tamil
country for its ‘heterogeneous characters, combined with its comic plot’,
and a fortune teller as its central figure. [32] The stories typically drew from
mythology and folklore, and were consumed by a variety of audiences. In
Serfoji’s _Devendra Kuravanji_ , however, there is a difference. In this
Marathi text, the goddess Indrani meets with a fortune teller and asks her to
speak of rivers, mountains and the numerous countries of the world. To an
extent, all familiar. But then, she demands unusually: ‘Tell me, what is the
moon’s orbit, and what planets revolve around the sun? What is the
diameter of the Earthsphere?’ [33] For this was a modern geography and
astronomy class, and Indrani’s interlocutor elucidates Copernican ideas,
weaving a verbal picture of the globe. Besides, as one writer put it,
kuravanjis usually featured temple towns: Tirupati, Chidambaram, Benares
and Rameswaram. [34] With Serfoji, however, the listener encounters a new
world: Delaware and Edinburgh, North Carolina and Ottawa, Jamaica and
Nigeria, New York and Lisbon. [35] Instead of Puranic tales and concepts, the
_Devendra Kuravanji_ edified and educated in a new way, transmitting what
the rajah had learnt in English to a wider audience in an Indian language.
Indeed, as the fortune teller declares to Indrani, ‘You know the cosmology
of the Puranas. Listen! I shall now tell you a cosmography and geography
different from that one.’ [36] Both Indrani and her discussant were known to
the listeners; it was what they spoke that was novel. Nor did this knowledge
seem too intimidating or disruptive. For emerging from the mouths of
established characters, they deftly sewed the unfamiliar into the familiar.

The rajah’s contemporary and court poet, Vedanayakam Sastri, a student

of Schwartz’s, also produced several compositions of this nature. Sastri—a


-----

high-caste Christian who would fall out with British missionaries in time
for refusing to renounce Hindu cultural markers and caste—authored a
poem for Serfoji in which the Biblical narrative is enmeshed with the facts
of science. Where the creation of man is discussed, Sastri tacks on a
detailed account of the human body: muscles, blood vessels, a precise count
of bones and more. Talking about Noah’s Ark and its building, he first
makes a detour to note ‘ninety species of trees’ around the Tamil
countryside. There are lists of insects, the varieties of rice cultivated in the
region and the types of fish in the water upon which the ark floats. [37] In
receipt of a stipend from Serfoji, and himself an instructor at a mission
school, Sastri was wedded to both his religion and modern education in a
regional idiom. He was also, like his patron, a man with an eye on the
future: When asked once about the contradiction between caste
discrimination and the principle of equality, Sastri explained that change
could not be forced, instead proposing something more incremental. [38]

Serfoji was fond of him—on days when he was barred by custom from
Hindu rites, Sastri would sing for him church songs and Tamil hymns. [39] It
is likely, then, that the missionary strategy, exemplified by de Nobili and the
like, of adapting Christianity to Hindu sensibilities, was here inverted to
promote the cause of the rajah and his friends. Except that it was not
religion they were selling but Western knowledge, as a means to adapt to a
changing world.

While the rajah patronized everything from Sanskrit academies in

Benares to missionary work in districts adjoining his seat, the hub of his
intellectual pursuits was, of course, Tanjore. In fact, by the 1820s, there was
such demand from every passing European to visit Serfoji’s palace that he
was forced to register a complaint about not wanting to make his home a
‘Shew House’. [40] But public curiosity can be forgiven given the sheer
activity underway in the fort. To its dispensary, for example, was attached a
posse of experts: doctors who specialized in handling poison, eye diseases,
urinary disorders and so on, their research and remedies catalogued in Tamil
verse. [41] Art supplies and painting material were imported for the court

painters, who invented a hybrid Anglo–Indian style and were soon in
demand with Company officials. [42] Most significantly, in a city with a
palace and a great temple, Serfoji emphasised a very different type of
monument: the Sarasvati Mahal library. Originally under the Nayakas, its
expanded shelves now featured 4500 books in Western languages, and ten
times as many Indian manuscripts. [43] European music occupied thirty
volumes, with local performers trained to play both the Indian veena and
the piano. [44] White residents in and around Tanjore were overawed by the
rajah’s literary hoard, delighted when he allowed them to borrow. Even
today, a visit takes us into a hall with cupboards stacked on cupboards,
many filled with palm-leaf texts in Indian languages. That most of this was
the collection of a single productive mind makes the experience only more
astonishing. If the rajah believed himself, as a British official grumbled, to
be ‘the most interesting object in Hindoostan’, one can forgive his
immodesty. [45]

Notably, Serfoji was not a dilettante satisfying an idle curiosity—as his

public education programme demonstrates, knowledge accumulated was
intended for as wide a dissemination as possible. The printing press, Bishop
Heber noticed, too was put to operation: While the rajah’s hope to start a
bilingual ‘national gazette’ never materialized, he did use it to publish a
Marathi translation of _Aesop’s Fables_ , besides seven other texts. [46] And
where his medical treatises stayed true to tradition by citing Hindu sages
from Sanskrit books, their _actual_ prescriptions were based on Serfoji’s
translations into Tamil of knowledge acquired from the latest European
journals. [47] As early as 1800, in fact, the rajah commenced medical
education, soon also taking lessons in anatomy with a British surgeon.
When a human body made its way to him, despite the risk of corroding his
caste status, he proceeded with his investigations. Intelligent as he was,
Serfoji found a way to avoid scandal: Human beings, he announced, were
‘wrought by the supreme being’, so inquiries into their physical constitution
were imbued with divine meaning. [48] Either way, as the historian Savithri
Preetha Nair notes, decades before the first modern dissection by a Hindu


-----

was reported in British territory to overblown fanfare, here, in Tanjore, our
prince set a precedent. [49] Serfoji also commissioned a wooden skeleton (for
high-caste Hindus around him presumably, who saw touching real bone as
taboo), besides obtaining a microscope and a host of other scientific gadgets
—a mark of wide networks and also passionate interest.

So too the rajah put the talents of his court artists at work, on the one

hand to produce portraits and material of a predictable type for distribution
as gifts, and also to illustrate the natural world around him: fish, crabs,
spiders, squid and prawns. [50] Botany was attended to: Plants were acquired
from as far as China and America, [51] and he obtained not only more
Sanskrit manuscripts but also seeds on a pilgrimage to Benares. The
‘wonders’ in Calcutta’s botanical garden thrilled him; its ‘significance,’ he
wrote to his son, ‘cannot be praised in a simple letter’. [52] As Viswanathan
Peterson states, ‘While his European counterparts were collecting Asian
exotica’, Serfoji was focusing on Western technology and ideas, spending a
fortune over three decades catalysing a small-scale Indian Enlightenment. [53]

The most remarkable detail, however, is that he achieved this without
causing injury to his position as a Hindu prince heading a social edifice of
increasingly defensive orthodoxy. He maintained dozens of temples and
built new ones, celebrating gods venerated in Tamil country, deities
imported by his Maratha ancestors, and festivals sacred to his Muslim and
Christian subjects. [54] In its outward manifestations and literary projects, his
kingly identity stayed rooted in the land’s cultural legacy, [55] and he was not
above seeking good karma by feeding thousands of Brahmins or presenting
cows, including to bemused white people. [56] Even his Marathi translation of
_Aesop’s Fables_ featured woodcuts of his gods. [57] This meant that all at
once, Serfoji was a ‘good’ Hindu, avoiding deracination. But equally he was
at ease with the modern world, dominated by the West and its ideas.

It was this supposed contradiction that the British could never

comprehend. Serfoji may have built a tower of glory to commemorate their
victory over Napoleon, and he did refer fawningly to ‘milk from the

[Company’s] breast’ when they raised him from a middling ‘Excellency’ to


-----

a full ‘Highness’ in title. [58] But even so, no European was ever allowed
entry into his temples, causing Valentia, for example, to wonder how
someone ‘with an excellent understanding’ and rational sensibilities could
yet remain ‘a slave to Hindoo superstition’. That he could be ‘more than
indulgent’ to Protestant missionaries and Catholics both, while holding on
as a ‘strict follower’ of Brahmin ideologies was, to visitors, inexplicable. [59]

To Serfoji, though, this was no paradox: Embracing knowledge, no matter
its provenance, sat comfortably with ‘native’ ideals. To admire European
advancements did not equal a wholesale purchase of European culture. He
could operate both medieval shrines and study cadavers, just as he might
use age-old poetic techniques to communicate fresh lessons. Indeed, long
before Lord Macaulay notoriously wrote off India’s languages and culture
as incapable of grasping modern knowledge, the rajah’s innovations
revealed the fallacy of such sneering opinions. [60] On the contrary, Serfoji’s
example demonstrates how Indians were capable of identifying ‘progress’
without becoming anglicized inside out. Hindus could, this dispossessed
rajah showed, engage with modernity on their own terms. One did not have
to abandon the ground of one’s forebears to walk in new gardens; one could
build a bridge, flitting back and forth as needed—a selective appropriation
of Western ideas that future nationalists would champion.

It is tempting to imagine, then, if Serfoji might have achieved something

path-breaking in India had he enjoyed greater power; whether the Tanjore
model could, by the strength of its own brief success and originality, have
been exported to other corners of the subcontinent. The British thought
Hindus no good, believing their glories to have faded with the ancient past;
and yet here was an exhibit who, even if at a modest scale, achieved
greatness in the present. But sadly, little was carried forward: After the rajah
died in 1832, the ‘Tanjore Renaissance’ wilted, with only paler versions
following in other courts. [61] The political economy of the colonial system
did not favour such experiments, while at a personal level, Serfoji’s heir in
Tanjore lacked energy and purpose. When in 1855 this man died without
male progeny (despite a harem of twenty wives, seventeen of whom were
acquired one desperate day [62] ), the very Company which once deposed a
sitting prince to consecrate an adoptee, denied his widows the right to
nominate a successor. [63] The Maratha line in Tanjore, so far as the British
were concerned, was extinct; it had become too expensive to maintain. An


-----

outrageous attempt was made to seize and auction the rajah’s goods, but the
royal dowagers fought this in a seven-year legal battle. And so, though his
dynasty’s rule ended, Serfoji’s library survived. [64] The Sarasvati Mahal
stands even now as a memorial to this extraordinary figure—prince, poet,
botanist, scholar and an Enlightenment soul who remained, all the same, a
committed Hindu. [65]

In 1806, less than a decade after his enthronement, Serfoji forwarded to the
governor of Madras a complaint about transgressions by a Company
official. F.W. Ellis (1777–1819), a magistrate posted not far from the rajah’s
seat, had used force to detain a palace peon in a police matter, leaving
Serfoji ‘disturbed in a very extraordinary manner’. His court and he, after
all, enjoyed political immunity, and the rajah protested that he ‘never would
have signed any Treaty’ were it known ‘I might be considered to be
personally amenable’ to the Company’s jurisdiction. The authorities moved
at once to repair his feelings: London chastised Ellis for ‘inexperience’,
while Madras would transfer him out of the district. Ellis did not appreciate
the ‘banishment’, [66] but the real irony is that had he and Serfoji fraternized
more, they would likely have got along: They had shared interests,
attempted similar things and some of the former’s writing coincided with
the Tanjore rajah’s experiments. For instance, just as Serfoji repurposed the
kuravanji for geography lessons, Ellis also innovated, as seen in a Tamil
text he produced, to promote the smallpox vaccine. In his _The Legend of the_
_Cow-Pox_ , thus, Ellis presents the Hindu lord of medicine in dialogue with
the mother goddess, learning of a sixth element she has added to the cow’s
five (established) sacred products ( _panchagavya_ ): ‘pearls’ (cowpox
pustules!) to protect mankind from disease. [67] A scientific discussion
follows on inoculation and vaccination, the aim being to inform its Tamil
audience in a familiar cultural mode of advances in medicine. [68] This was a


-----

Serfoji-style literary creation—traditional shape, modern content—
emerging surprisingly from the pen of an Englishman.

Ellis was what we today call an orientalist. In India, these were often

officials moonlighting as savants, with a stated desire for unearthing and
disseminating knowledge about the East in the West. [69] (Indeed, one
scholar’s formal day job included ‘hunting’ dacoits. [70] ) While missionaries
had for centuries been playing a similar role, their portrayals were inflected,
as we saw, by religion. Eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century
orientalists, on the other hand, were keen not so much to Christianize India
— _their_ appetite to ‘know’ the country stemmed more from wanting to
better _rule_ it. [71] This, after all, was what Warren Hastings envisioned when
propping up ‘Hindu law’—to restore to Hindus their traditional legal
systems, as he perceived it, inviting gratitude and legitimacy for his
government. ‘Every accumulation of knowledge’ about those ‘over whom
we exercise dominion’, he explained, was ‘useful’ in that it ‘attracts and
conciliates’. Showing an interest in local culture ‘lessen[ed] the weight of
the chain by which the natives are held in subjection’. [72] The chain itself
was non-negotiable, but with the right sounds, Indians could be lulled into
ignoring it. Or as the historian Richard Drayton notes, ‘Service to the cause
of Knowledge lent dignity to an enterprise which might have appeared
otherwise as mere plunder and rapine.’ [73] Officials, besides, had personal
incentives in scholarship too. For this was a type of ‘self-advertisement’ for
career advancement. [74] Simply put, though orientalists are often cast as
noble figures working with ‘few tools other than their enthusiasm’, [75] they
were and remained also instruments of colonial politics. [76]

Nevertheless, these men did break new ground and achieve a great deal;

around the same time that Serfoji grew besotted with modern science, white
officials launched a romance of sorts with _ancient_ India and its mysteries. In
the late eighteenth century, for instance, Sanskrit was assumed to be the
‘grand Source of Indian Literature, the Parent of almost every dialect from
the Persian Gulph [sic] to the China Seas’. [77] It was Ellis who amended
prevailing wisdom by demonstrating that peninsular Indian languages


-----

‘form[ed] a distinct family’. [78] It was not a passing factoid: Future research
would suggest that the Dravidian language group—as it is now called—
once straddled the subcontinent, illuminating a historical era prior to the
spread of Indo–Aryan culture. [79] Ellis’s finding also reined in the idea that
India could be known only through Sanskrit; there was a history to the land
—and Hinduism—beyond the ‘language of the gods’. [80] Similarly, while
‘natives’ had narratives of the past, registered in oral traditions, collective
memory and in writing, [81] this new crop of white explorers began to stitch
together diffused information, slowly developing a shared, scientifically
analysed [82] and systematically presented _Indian_ history—a commodity that
would prove useful for nationalists in future. For example, starting in the
1780s, officials noted inscriptions in an indecipherable script. With one in
Orissa, Brahmins knew it concerned Buddhists and viewed it, therefore,
with ‘shuddering and disgust’. [83] But it would be the 1830s, before James
Prinsep (1799–1840)—whose official duties were at the government mint—
joined inscriptional dots to decode Brahmi, ancestor to almost all Indian
scripts. [84] Suddenly, the etchings came alive, reanimating a written system
Indians had forgotten, and with it, fresh facets of the subcontinent’s story.

But there was more. Thanks to Prinsep, a heap of inscriptions scattered

around the country were confirmed as holding the words of one great figure:
Emperor Ashoka. Brahmin and Buddhist traditions spoke, of course, of this
third century bce monarch, [85] but he was hardly common knowledge.
Indeed, an 1808 book, the _Rajaboli_ ( _Story of Kings_ ), published by an Indian
no less, made no mention of the man. [86] It was through British inquiries that
Ashoka was recentered not just as one of India’s most distinguished rulers,
but as a global luminary, his influence as a patron of Buddhism felt as far as
China. In time, a lion capital from one of his monumental pillars would
inspire India’s state emblem; his _chakra_ , or wheel of righteousness, today
sits at the centre of the country’s flag. The Western ‘discovery’ of Ashoka,
in fact, followed the equally momentous identification of his forebears. The
celebrated William Jones (1746–94)—a Calcutta judge who was consulted
during Serfoji’s unusual succession, [87] and founded in 1784 the Asiatic


-----

Society where orientalist data was synthesized [88] —knew from Greek
accounts of an ancient Indian city called Palimbothra. In India, he came
across ‘Pataliputra’ in Sanskrit but locating the place proved a challenge—
until, that is, a retired map-maker and surveyor reported that in the course
of _his_ work, he had heard the people of Patna, in Bihar, apply the term to
their city. [89] One thing led to another, and by 1793, Jones was able to
declare that the Indian king ‘Sandracottus’ who ruled from Palimbothra in
Greek histories was likely Emperor Chandragupta, Ashoka’s grandfather.
For the first time, we read, ‘Indian and Greco–Roman history could be
synchronized’, placing the country’s past in a rational time frame and
chronology. [90]

Jones, in fact, was to become the godfather of Orientalism in India,

launching also a passion in the West for Sanskrit literature. On the one
hand, as part of the British quest for ‘Hindu law’, he would translate the
_Manusmriti_ into English. [91] But what cemented his fame was poetry. It was
through this Welshman that Europe acquired a fuller picture of ‘the
treasures’ of Sanskrit. [92] Here, he ‘discovered the Homers, Pindars, and
Platos of the East’, and in the poet Kalidasa he noted ‘an oriental
Shakespeare’. [93] His translation of the latter’s _Abhijnanasakuntalam_ as
_Sacontala: Or The Fatal Ring_ (1789) sparked a veritable craze in Europe:
The philosopher Schlegel thought it represented ‘the best idea of Indian
poetry’, [94] while Goethe wished to fly East, for ‘Sakontala, Nala [the other


-----

protagonist], they have to be kissed’. [95] One writer went so far as to flatter a
Prussian queen by comparing her with the play’s heroine, [96] while
Schopenhauer believed that as the revival of Greek literature had nourished
the Renaissance, Sanskrit would catalyse something similar in the modern
period. [97] Jones proclaimed the language itself to be ‘more perfect than the
Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than
either’. Indeed, he noted how Sanskrit bore ‘to both of [these European
languages] a stronger affinity’ than could ‘possibly have been produced by
accident’; they had ‘sprung from some common source’. [98] It was another
significant moment, for Jones had outlined what we identify now as the
Indo–European language family. The spoken tongues of Europe, Persia and
many in South Asia are descended, research confirms, from a common
mother. [99] This again placed India’s culture—once defined through
monsters and paganism—in a temperate global history.

With religion too, there were advances. H.T. Colebrooke (1765–1837)—

the son of a bankrupt former Company chairman—was able to see that the
Vedic religion predated Buddhism, and that Hinduism as it later evolved
was no resuscitation, but the novel Puranic system. [100] Despite its ‘seeming
polytheism’, he confirmed too that its ‘real doctrine’ was not. [101] And he did
this not on the basis of hearsay or secondary accounts, as with previous
commentators, but by way of a study of Brahminical scripture. In fact,
Colebrooke would, despite errors, [102] offer the first detailed account of
Indian philosophy also, doing so through Sanskrit texts and commentaries.
His admiration was, of course, not unqualified. Hindus were ‘the most
ancient nation of which we have valuable remains’, argued Colebrooke, but
it was also true that in their religion, ‘the true and the false, the sublime and
the puerile, wisdom and absurdity, [were] so intermixed, that, at every step,
we have to smile at folly, while we admire . . . the philosophical truth’. [103]

Though Christian critics at home accused Colebrooke of making a ‘display
of superstition’ for even so circumscribed an airing of appreciation, it was
nevertheless a scholarly leap compared to what had circulated so far. [104]

And he persevered, writing on everything from the daily rituals of the ideal


-----

Brahmin, sectarian differences in Hinduism, on Jainism and caste, [105] to
offering a lively zoological essay on ‘A Species of Ox named Gayal’. For
what it was worth, Colebrooke was also involved in the making of yet
another digest of ‘Hindu law’. While it added to his prestige, here, as might
be expected, he had limited success; our Englishman’s code was as
confusing as prior attempts. [106]

While orientalists, thus, rearranged and organized Indian tradition and

history, their approach was not, however, free of long congealed European
biases. H.H. Wilson (1786–1860), who would publish everything from a
Sanskrit dictionary to a translation of Kalidasa’s _Meghaduta_ , was
convinced, for example, that there was no need to journey beyond Sanskrit
to know India. Despite Ellis’s findings in the south, Hindus, he declared,
‘can be understood _only_ through [its] medium’; ‘it _alone_ furnishes us with
the master spring of all the actions and passions, their prejudices and errors,
and enables us to appreciate their vices or their worth’. [107] While Sanskrit
mattered, Wilson’s statement is akin to arguing that Europe might only be
unravelled via Latin, casting aside regional languages and their historical
and religious material. Earlier, Halhed—Hastings’s colleague who we met
in the previous chapter—published _A Grammar of the Bengal Language_
(1778). Bengali, he declared, was mauled by ‘illiterate generation[s]’ and
Islamic influence. So, he excised ‘words as are not natives of the
country’—‘unauthorized’ terms from Persian—and offered a version
‘derived from its parent the Shanscrit’ alone. [108] While Bengali _is_
descended from Sanskrit, over centuries it had formed a distinct identity; in
‘purifying’ it, Halhed ‘set the clock back’. [109] He himself admitted that his
version could not ‘be expected to convey a thorough idea of the modern
jargon’ actually in use. [110] It was Bengali as a white man—whose exposure
to the language covered a total of 200 folios [111] —felt it _ought_ to be spoken.
This is akin to a gang of foreigners landing in Britain, decreeing that
interlopers like ‘bandana’, ‘bagel’ and ‘banana’ be expunged forthwith from
English and that these be replaced with untainted Germanic alternatives. [112]


-----

There remained, then, a clumsy bookishness with which more than a few
orientalists went about interpreting India.

Worse still, this tendency to ‘purify’ assumed a tone of moral judgement.

So, if Jones was feted for his translations, into the same translations were
also braided Western, Christian sensibilities. Where in Kalidasa’s original,
Sakuntala is sweaty, for example, Jones transcribed a glowing complexion
to avoid shocking white readers with the text’s open sensuality. Where her
breasts are described, his inner censor purged the line, [113] so that Sakuntala
in Europe was a deterged, redacted heroine. [114] Colebrooke too, referring to
Magha’s seventh-century _Sisupalavadha_ , could not help but rue how ‘the
Indian taste for . . . licentious description’ had ‘disfigured’ even this work.
115 Remedial doctoring was the result, with little unease felt: As a third
orientalist wrote, India was, after all, England’s ‘literary property’. [116] All
along, these attitudes affected ‘natives’ too; faced with the censure of their
ancestors’ tastes, under colonial rule they would absorb feelings of shame.
Indeed, in the Victorian age, Hindus could surpass Victorians in stiffness,
stripping away or obscuring ‘embarrassing’ portions of their heritage. The
seventeenth-century Ksetrayya’s devotional poetry, for instance, has erotic
components; modern brown men, though, oscillated between rejecting him
and trying to rehabilitate him by concocting ‘spiritual meanings’ for playful
verses. [117] It was akin to dyeing a tapestry in the dull greys of Great Britain,
but it was done so that the ‘native’ could fit in with the age’s reigning
values. [118] And this slowly acquired real-world consequences: In Kerala,
where women conventionally moved about bare breasted, the female body
was hereon expected to blouse up. By the end of the nineteenth century,
even princesses began to sit for portraits grasping a cloth against their
breasts, retaining (topless) custom in private, but deferring to new
(‘civilized’) Victorian values in public.

But just as Serfoji proved to be anything but a stereotype, Hindus in

dialogue with the British too were not merely reacting or passively
absorbing new values. In their own ways, they took part in and influenced
Orientalism. To begin with, Englishmen in India were reliant on brown


-----

aides. And these mostly Brahmin assistants, the scholar Rama Sundari
Mantena reminds us, ‘were active, sentient beings’. [119] Some observed what
the British esteemed and pointed to Hindu parallels. Radhakant, a talented,
‘sensible’ aide of Jones’s, ‘attentive to English manners’, is an example: It
was he who explained that just as the Europeans had plays, Indians had
_nataka_ s; that its ‘best specimen’ was Sakuntala. [120] At the other end were
those who duped their patrons. Francis Wilford (1761–1822), an army man,
was mortified in his study of Hindu geography, thus, on learning that
seemingly ancient references to Britain were bunkum—his Brahmin aide,
even as he collected a handsome fee, simply manufactured 12,000 verses on
‘swetadipa’ (white island) and planted them in Sanskrit texts. [121] But most
importantly, there were those appropriating, mimicking and steadily _owning_
British methods and inquiries. Colin Mackenzie (1754–1821)—surveyor
general of India—archived 1568 manuscripts, 2630 drawings, 8076
inscriptions, 6218 coins and more in the south, [122] with five Brahmin
brothers. [123] He valued their ‘assiduity’ [124] and they showed devotion to his
mission. But as the historian Tobias Wolffhardt notes, payment alone does
not explain this commitment; the fact is that these siblings ‘could identify
with the project’. [125] One of them, after his master’s death, hoped to
continue his work; when turned down on what can only be called racial
grounds, [126] he founded the Madras Hindu Literary Society: an attempt at a
brown man’s Asiatic Society. [127] Another would publish books on India in
English, marking the rise of a distinct new entity: the ‘native’ who ceased
assisting the West so as to _address_ it. [128]

Indeed, in what was an unforeseen byproduct of modern Orientalism,

European researches contributed to a steady ballooning of Indian
confidence. For one, the orientalist retrieval of past heroes and its
celebration of brown men’s accomplishments injected pride into Britain’s
colonized subjects. It sparked self-worth among ‘natives’, galvanizing what
a twentieth-century historian called a ‘patriotic spirit’ and ‘manly’ feelings
in an age of political enervation. [129] Thus, from the brown man’s perch,
Ashoka was not a historical curiosity but an Indian hero; Kalidasa’s literary
exploits were evidence of what Hindus had once achieved—and could, if
they applied themselves, accomplish again. In the ‘degraded’ present too,
there were British writers who posited strong prospects for Indians. James
Tod (1782–1835), for instance, built up a glamorous image of Rajputs in


-----

India’s north-western deserts as warriors, seeing in them a spirited people,
rising throughout history to defend faith and freedom. He had his own goals
in this—the man hoped to recruit Rajput states as British allies by providing
them a measure of political autonomy. But to quote the words of a latenineteenth-century observer, the Scotsman’s history also ended up making [130]
‘Hindoos proud of their ancestors’. [131] The white man’s researches, that is,
accelerated the formation of modern identities and the Hindu self-image. So
much so that if Hastings intended Western scholarly scrutiny to render
chains of subjugation invisible, in only a few generations, ‘natives’ would
appropriate such scrutiny to first loosen—and then break—their shackles.
And just as Serfoji creatively wed modern ideas to tradition as a prince, his
countrymen would strategically seize on orientalist learning to assert
political individuality as a _people_ .

Nothing illustrates this as well as the career of the Bhagavad Gita—a

700-verse meditation in the 1,00,000-verse epic Mahabharata between
events of political negotiation and cataclysmic war. Lodged in a story of
pan-Indian appeal, the Gita’s teachings represent at one level the message
of god; a dramatization, as the scholar W.J. Johnson put it, of the bond
between man and the almighty. [132] A text that was always prized among
Hindu philosophers, orientalists too began to celebrate the Gita. For one,
Hastings, in promoting the 1785 English translation, wished to showcase
the sophistication of Hindu thought, declaring the Gita’s theology as
‘accurately corresponding’ with Christianity’s fundamentals. [133] While his
political goal was to resist lobbies at home urging anglicized government in
India, [134] more generally, the text satisfied the Enlightenment-era trend too
of ‘finding’ monotheism in the East. [135] Its translator, the ‘Sanskrit-mad’
Charles Wilkins (1749–1836), [136] thought the Gita to ‘contain all the grand
mysteries’ of Hinduism, and proof of ‘learned’ Brahmins’ loyalty to ‘one
God’. [137] In a Europe reeling from fabrications like the _Ezourvedam_ , the
Gita’s credentials caused a sensation—indeed, Jones advised his peers to
forget all that had preceded it. [138] In Germany, Schlegel viewed the text as a
‘handbook of Hindu mysticism’, while Humboldt thanked the heavens ‘for


-----

having allowed him to live long enough’ to soak in its wisdom. [139] While by
1869—as happened every now and then with Hindu material—a claim
would appear that the Gita _actually_ drew its ideas from the Bible, [140] the
text received massive acclaim in the West as a window into uncorrupted
Hindu spiritual thinking.

But even as orientalists valourized the Gita as part of their particular

preoccupations, how did Hindus take to this? To begin with, it cannot be
denied that British interest played a powerful role in popularizing the Gita
among large sections of Hindus themselves. Until the eighteenth century,
this was the preserve of a ‘circumscribed and erudite’ elite. [141] Why, even
Gandhi first encountered the Gita not in its Sanskrit original or an Indian
rendition, but in English. [142] The deity Krishna, who appears within as the
supreme divinity, besides, is a serious figure; he in _popular_ worship took an
endearing, mischievous Puranic form, playing pranks and attracting legions
of female admirers. [143] While this lovable Krishna has not been abandoned,
144 the Gita’s new-found prominence enabled Hindus to hold their own
against Christian criticism. Its success in Europe raised the text into a
talisman for fighting charges of idolatry in India. So much so, that in the
200 years after Wilkins, over 1400 translations of the book have been
published in dozens of local languages—a sign of its canonical centrality to
modern Hinduism. [145] Today, the Gita enjoys global recognition as _the_ book
of all Hindus, or what an early-nineteenth-century brown intellectual
considered the ‘essence’ of all their scripture. [146] Indeed some years ago,
Britain’s first Hindu prime minister was cheered in his ancestral homeland
for having taken his parliamentary oath with a palm on a copy. [147] It is one
of those ironies of history that this axiomatic stardom enjoyed by the text
derives in good measure from the attention it received via a Shropshire-born
civil servant.

Yet, this was not all. What British enthusiasm likely ignored was the

context in which the Gita appears in the Mahabharata. ‘Of the world’s great
scriptures,’ a scholar writes, ‘only the Gita is set on a battlefield’, [148] at a
moment where Arjuna, one of its heroes, is racked with guilt about going to


-----

war against his own kin. It is here that Krishna ‘enlarges Arjuna’s
awareness beyond the personal and social values’ that he ‘holds sacred,
compelling him to recognize why he must fight’. [149] This, in fact, would
turn the Gita—so adored by orientalists—by the end of the next century
into nationalist ammunition for Hindu elites _fighting_ the Raj. As early as
1857, in fact—soon after the greatest armed anti-colonial uprising in India
—a missionary warned of the Gita’s threatening potential. Krishna’s
exhortation to dismiss ‘unmanly weakness’ and pick up arms could justify
‘any leading mutineer’. [150] His fears were accurate. ‘The Gita is the best
answer,’ a future revolutionary would proclaim, ‘to those who shrink from .
. . aggression as a lowering of morality.’ [151] Indeed, by 1918, officials
would be describing it as a ‘text-book for the mental training of
revolutionary recruits’ in the country. [152] For besides all that the Gita
offered the soul, it could also be read as a book of action, [153] making it the
‘bible of the Indian national movement’. [154] Twentieth-century groups
actively venerated it as a totem of Hindu nationalism, and as a text to
surmount differences of sect and caste. [155] It was an amusing turn—
translating the Gita, Wilkins had ascribed Brahmins’ willingness to share it
with foreigners to the gratitude ‘natives’ felt for British rule. [156] And here
were ‘natives’ employing the same material not long after to show those
foreigners the door.

In sum, the orientalist assembly of historical knowledge was an

enterprise begun by a ruling race; its Indian appropriation, however, was
about ‘natives’ reclaiming agency. Western inquiries into their past would
allow Hindus to slowly attempt telling their own story, and in forms and
ways that put them on the road to asserting nationality. After all, as the
thinker Sudipta Kaviraj put it, ‘To give itself a history is the most
fundamental act of self-identification of a community.’ [157] There was no
disagreement that India had known greatness in the past. Had not Jones
himself, after all, declared that no matter ‘how degenerate and abased . . .
the Hindus may now appear’, ‘they were [once] splendid in arts and arms,
happy in government, wise in legislation, and eminent in various


-----

knowledge’? [158] The difference, however, lay in this: British voices saw in
India’s subsequent decline a justification for their own presence here, as
saviours and uplifting, civilizing forces. ‘Natives’, however, would view
foreign rule, in the scholar Monika Bhagat-Kennedy’s words, as purely
‘temporary tutelage’. [159] For them, as expressed in the writings of
nineteenth-century thinkers, knowledge of the past—one that was ‘arousing
the enthusiasm of European scholars even today’ [160] —was a force to
‘accelerate’ national progress; history was but a tool to ‘teach the present’
and shape a pathway to India’s ‘regeneration’. [161] That is, to quote a
Bengali intellectual from the 1880s, the point of history was to make people
‘complete beings’. ‘A person who keeps thinking that his ancestors have not
achieved anything of value will not achieve anything himself.’ [162]

It was this emerging ‘native’ desire for present-day achievement that

would unsettle the Raj. But for Hindus too, the journey ahead was long.
Chanting praises of ancient glory helped prepare the ground, yes, and to lay
a psychological foundation for articulating identity. Actively _building_ on it,
though, was a whole other process. And for many, empowerment lay in
embracing yet more modern learning—much like with Serfoji—focused not
only on history and literature but also science and technology. [163] These
were the planks on which Europe had risen to power; this was how Britain,
despite its ‘sterile soil’, rose to dominance in so many countries. [164] And so
these must also, they argued, be the instruments with which India—and
Hindu society—returned to its rightful place in the world.

Not long before Bishop Heber visited Serfoji in Tanjore, he travelled to
Hinduism’s most sacred city. [165] Benares was home to Brahmins from all
over the land—107 groups by a later count—and kings vied to maintain
almshouses and build pilgrim ghats along its riverbank. [166] The Company
had conquered the area in the 1780s, and soon after, Jonathan Duncan, an
associate of Hastings, was placed in charge. With well-meaning energy, the


-----

man set off ‘improvements’, ranging from taxes on new idols in a city
evidently overflowing with gods, to building public toilets. [167] This effort to
deliver ‘order’ was no success, though: In Heber’s day, its roads were as
cluttered as before, with cattle ‘lazily’ plodding alongside ascetics and
streams of beggars. [168] And yet, ‘in the midst of all this wretchedness’ were
mansions, and bazaars for diamonds, silks and foreign ware—for Benares
was also a trading centre. [169] But what truly shook Heber—and not in a
very welcome fashion—was the _vidyalaya_ (‘house of learning’), with 200
scholars engaged in Sanskrit studies. Walking into an astronomy lecture, the
bishop observed a pandit at work: The South Pole, he was telling his class,
was the perch of the tortoise Hindus reckoned bore the weight of the world.
Heber likely rolled his eyes, for the Brahmin ‘very slily’ added that this is
what ‘our people’ believed. It did little to mollify the intruder, who grew
irritated that such anachronisms were being peddled at government
expense. After all, the vidyalaya, also known as the Sanskrit College,
worked under British authority; the pandit speaking of the mythical reptile
was on the Company payroll. [170] It is no wonder that Serfoji left a superior
impression: that Maratha prince, living off a political pension, represented
something far more ‘modern’ to Western minds.

A view of Benares, by Thomas Daniell (1796), from the Wellcome Collection.

It is true that in the post-Enlightenment age, Puranic material was about

as reliable in knowing the world as Greek mythology. The Puranas spoke of
seven seas, for instance, but believed these to be of salt water, sugar cane
juice, liquor, ghee, milk, curd and sweet water. [171] To teach this as
established fact in the nineteenth century, understandably, rankled those
who actually sailed the oceans and knew them to possess no flavour other
than salty. But worse was the fact that if pandits taught outdated lessons, it
was because the British subsidized this. Not long after taking charge in
Benares, thus, Duncan proposed funding a ‘Hindoo College’ to preserve
‘the Laws, Literature and Religion’ of the land. This, he felt, offered twin
benefits. By ‘exceeding’ earlier patrons ‘in our attention’ to Brahmins in this
holiest of sacred sites, the Company would win popularity—a stance in line
with trends seen in the previous chapter. The second advantage was that,


-----

besides helping collect ‘complete treatises’ in Sanskrit, such an institution
would serve as a ‘nursery of future doctors’ of Hindu law, to ‘assist’
European judges. [172] Calcutta agreed: An ‘Institution founded expressly to
promote the study of Laws and Religion must be extremely flattering to

[Hindu] prejudices.’ [173] The idea, that is, was not so much the dissemination
of good knowledge as making the Company look less forbidding. And if
that was the 1790s, thirty years later, when Poona was taken from the
Marathas, the same logic saw the establishment of a Sanskrit college there
too. [174] It was only in the order of things, then, that Heber found pupils still
learning about the world-bearing tortoise, even as Serfoji transmitted more
updated lessons in Tanjore. Where a Hindu with agency and exposure
explored Western ideas proactively, the Company, in its anxiety to fit in,
seemed to side with obsolete learning. [175]

The orientalist justification for this was passionate. As Wilson wrote in

1836, the British had caused disruption in India. They had ‘exterminated’
Hindus’ conventional patrons (rajahs and others) and ‘usurped’ power and
wealth, untethering ‘native literature’ from its sources of shelter. Unless the
Company were willing to restore the princes it had flattened, it could not
afford a ‘supercilious indifference’ to Hindu learning. It was true that ‘we
cannot sympathize with their tastes’, but that was irrelevant; by supporting
what ‘natives’ ostensibly valued, the British would ‘avoid reminding our
subjects that we are still strangers’. [176] And he was not alone in adding to a
sense of moral obligation paranoia around security. As early as the 1790s, a
Company director thought it ‘folly’ to give brown men’s intellects a modern
polish, for armed with fresh ideas around liberty, they might conspire
against the British. [177] Decades later, a governor general concurred that
educating Indians was ‘contrary to reason’, because ‘[n]o intelligent people
would submit to our government’. [178] From this perspective, speaking of
sugar-water seas was safer, coming also with the advantage of reassuring
the British that they were satisfying ‘native’ expectations. Besides,
orientalist probing pointed to a fair deal that _was_ good in Sanskrit. Hindus
had compiled valuable material about ‘the virtues of plants and drugs’ and


-----

authored ‘treatises on Astronomy and Mathematics’. [179] Referring to the
_Bijaganita_ , for example, a medieval tract on algebra, an official pronounced
every ‘scrap of Hindoo science’ interesting. [180] Why, William Jones knew a
Brahmin who himself ridiculed the Puranic fable of the seven seas,
declaring the earth ‘spheroidal’, with salty oceans, based on a different
Hindu school of astronomy. [181] Brown men, that is, only needed reminding
of the best of their traditional ideas, not a potentially explosive cargo of
imported intellectual goods.

Others in the Company, however, thought differently. In 1829, officials in

Delhi argued that a dose of modern learning would inspire ‘natives’ to
‘ _cease_ to desire and seek independence’. It would turn their ‘national
character’ ‘Anglo-Indian’, bringing the two sides closer, and _averting_ risks
of a ‘reaction . . . on the English interest’. [182] Besides, did the Company not
have a cultural responsibility to implant ‘English principles’, if only to
make ‘natives’ smarter servants? [183] That is, the British, in the historian
Gyan Prakash’s memorable words, now began to conceive of a right to
‘dominate in order to liberate’ Indians from their ‘civilizational shackles’.
184 Hindu prejudices needed not reinforcement, this argument decided, but
dismantling. Intellectually, meanwhile, critics pointed to the limits of
Sanskrit. Yes, there was good, but an immensity of the ‘frivolous’ also
passed off for knowledge; [185] the ‘Quixotism of fair dealing’ was leading to
the ‘cultivation of Error’. [186] Who could reasonably endorse British
patronage for ‘superstitious’ studies such as on astrology? [187] Evidence too
supported a course correction. Within years of its founding the Benares
College, for instance, became ‘an object of [the people’s] ridicule’. For far
from ‘an assemblage of learned Hindus’, it seemed ‘a band of pensioners
supported by [government] charity’. [188] Orientalists countered by
suggesting an ‘engrafting’ of Western ideas onto the better portions of
‘native’ learning, [189] and translating ‘English works into Sanskrit’—a case
of new wine, old bottles. [190] But this opened more complications. The
Benares college principal would in time concoct scientific terminology in
Sanskrit, thus. [191] Hydrogen became _jalakara_ , ‘maker of water’, oxygen


-----

_pranapada_ , ‘that which gives breath’. Magnesia, meanwhile, was rather
traumatizingly rendered as _adahyapatamulajanakasya pranapradaja_ : ‘that
which is born from oxygen’. [192] Instead of a popular textbook, however, the
attempt unsurprisingly ended in an unwieldy word-pickle.

Through the first half of the nineteenth century, then, the British

oscillated between promoting ‘traditional’ learning and introducing Western
ideas, struggling, unlike a Serfoji, to marry the two. [193] But there were
technical questions too. Formally, from 1813, a modest sum was allocated
for educating ‘natives’. [194] On its utilization, however, competing
viewpoints emerged. Some wanted ‘schools for the elements of learning’,
others ‘colleges for the higher branches’. ‘Some would instruct teachers
only, some would merely provide books, some would teach the English
language, others . . . science through translations.’ Besides there was
friction on whether the ‘wealthy’ and ‘learned’ ought to be the focus, or the
‘general community’. [195] The answers varied. In the 1820s, the governor of
Madras recommended, for example, schools to maximize benefit; at barely
Rs 50,000, his part of India could have 340 modern institutions, [196] oriented
towards ‘improvement of the country’. [197] Others, betraying British class
influences, insisted on restricting colonial patronage to Hindu elites, [198]

believing: ‘light must touch the mountain tops before it could pierce to the
levels and depths’. [199] Or as the governor general said in 1839—eighty
years into British rule—time ‘has _not_ yet arrived’ for mass education. [200]

His successor agreed: White men ought to found colleges for ‘the higher
classes alone’. [201] These quarrels meant that action was often reversed. In
Delhi, schools opened by an official were terminated. [202] In Madras, the
governor’s schools were abolished after his passing, with funds funnelled
towards what would become a university. [203] Debate continued, with
officials in the same province disagreeing. [204] So as with that word-salad of
a textbook, the British architecture for education was also, until the 1850s, a
patchwork of indecision.

But in all this, what exactly did ‘natives’ seek? A vocal section wanted

schools and colleges both but in English. As far as elementary vernacular
schooling went, they already had infrastructure (so that when the colonial
state at last began to support primary education, they simply had to offer
grants and streamline village pathasalas in many regions). [205] Or as
Ziegenbalg had reported from Tranquebar as early as 1713, ‘one can find, in
all towns, places, and villages, schools in which the youth is informed in
reading and writing’. [206] These were conducted in the homes of local
grandees, in temples or under trees, imparting literacy, knowledge of the
epics and arithmetic, with students departing after acquiring skills requisite


-----

to their caste vocations. [207] Madras in the 1820s, thus, had over 12,000
schools with 1,88,000 students. [208] In Bengal, in the next decade, a survey
estimated one ‘native’ school per sixty-three children. [209] There were no
rigid caste biases either: If in some parts, Brahmins ran the schools, in
others, non-Brahmins took the lead. And in the classroom, students of
diverse groups and religions studied together (the usual exception being
‘untouchables’, lowest in Hindu society). [210] So, to quote an 1830s
traveller, ‘The Hindoos are not literally an uneducated people.’ [211] Which
meant, as another writer affirmed, that the ‘native mind although it is asleep
is not dead’. [212] The dispute, then, was on how to arouse it, improving the
quality and scope of lessons. If on the British side, powerful interests
wished to use Sanskrit, impart Western ideas to elites through this medium
and leave them to filter down, influential ‘natives’ wanted direct access to
English.

Writing in the 1860s, for example—demonstrating how long the wrangle

continued—a Hindu critic made clear that if India were to achieve
‘regeneration, it cannot be . . . by means of Sanscrit tuition’. The latter
offered ‘romance’, which orientalists certainly valued, but what Indians also
needed was ‘bread’. And for this English was essential. [213]

The Hindoo mind is wedged in prejudices, and the Sanscrit ‘cannot minister to a mind
diseased.’ The Hindoo patient wants food, and not poison. The benighted native wants to
have the film removed from his eyes; but the Sanscrit surrounds him ‘with a cloud
instead, and ever-[en]during dark’. He wants to _advance_ —which is the watchword of
Europe; but the Sanscrit would keep him far in the rear of nations, and hold his mind in
bondage to antiquated notions. The Sanscrit held some good some two or three thousand
years ago; it is effete in the present day. The Sanscrit belongs to the age of the bow and
arrow . . .The English belongs to the age of Armstrongs, Railways, and Electric
Telegraphs. To cultivate the Sanscrit would be to doom ourselves to seek a grain of truth
from a bushel of chaff—to perpetuate the reign of error, and to ignore those high
achievements of the human intellect which have changed the face of the world . . . Surely,
we do not want to uphold the geography [featuring] . . .Seas of Butter; but to know the
use of the mariner’s compass . . .We do not want dreamy speculations; but practical
energy and matter-of-fact knowledge. We want to be men of the nineteenth century, and
to be admitted into the comity of civilized nations. Unquestionably, it is through the

agency of the English that this object can ever be hoped to be accomplished. [214]


-----

While there was some romanticization of English here, the fact is that many
‘natives’ equated mastery over it to progress. Under colonial rule, this was
to a degree natural; and Hindus had some experience seizing on new
languages anyway, as with Persian under Islamic rule. About forty years
before, thus, a Hindu intellectual in Bengal, [215] protested the inauguration
of yet another Sanskrit college. Sanskrit, he groaned, took ‘a lifetime’ to
learn, and was a ‘lamentable check on the diffusion of knowledge’. It
offered metaphysics, literature and grammar—which excited orientalists—
but India had ‘numerous professors’ for these already; it did not require the
British to furnish more. [216] Instead of being fed ‘what was known two
thousand years ago’, he sought ‘mathematics, natural philosophy, chemistry,
anatomy’ and other ‘useful sciences’. _These_ were the subjects that had
elevated the ‘nations of Europe’— _this_ is what ‘natives’ must now have. [217]

There was conviction here. Not long after, Swathi Tirunal (1813–46),
Travancore’s rajah and a pupil of one of Serfoji’s
ex-aides, proclaimed English books a ‘barrier against many prejudices and
false notions’. [218] Earlier, in 1816, a judge was ‘struck with the enthusiasm’
for ‘western literature and science’, [219] while twenty years thereafter, in
Madras, 70,000 men signed a petition for the revival of the English schools
established by that dead governor. ‘We seek not education which depends
on charity,’ it was also clarified, for they would _pay_ for English. [220] One
entrepreneur who opened English schools in Bengal, in fact, was actively
chased by boys shouting: ‘Me poor boy, have pity on me, take me in,’ [221]

while another traveller observed that to master English, Brahmins would
even pick up the Bible. [222] Why, in the Company-sponsored Sanskrit
colleges too, pressure resulted in the inauguration of English sections, their
popularity surpassing those of the original, founding classes. [223]

The orientalists dismissed this as stemming from purely pecuniary

motivations. Indians picked up English but without imbibing seriously
Western ideas. They had ‘no taste for our literature, no participation in our
sentiments, no impression of our principles’, and, instead, remained ‘in all
essential respects of character . . . [at] a level with the rest of their


-----

countrymen’. [224] Their love of the ruling class’s language was precipitated
merely by hopes of employment. Was it wise, then, to invest in a selfish,
‘promiscuous crowd of English smatterers’, unlikely to serve as the
‘regenerators of their country’? [225] On the face of it, there was truth to the
charge. As early as 1626, trading centres had ‘olive-coloured Indian footboys’ who ‘prettily prattle[d] English’ as they assisted English merchants.
226 In the 1780s, schools Serfoji’s mentor, Schwartz, set up grew attractive
to job-seeking Brahmins. [227] In Madras city, a single road featured a
rumoured 100 boards advertising English training, [228] and it was not
uncommon for Company retirees to augment their income running language
centres. [229] And yet, this was an incomplete picture: As the scholar Parimala
Rao shows, most jobs available to Indians did not require English and the
higher vacancies that did were barred. Even when the latter were opened,
not many went for them: Of 900 boys who graduated from English schools
between 1824 and 1836 in Bombay, less than 100 sought government
positions. [230] The jibe that English education produced an army of clerks
was incorrect; it would generate ‘political leaders, professional men, and
intellectuals’—not unlike Serfoji. [231] And most significantly, many _did_ wish
to regenerate their country; indeed by the 1840s, we find, as the next
chapter will show, clear articulations of nationalist thought in India. And
this was addressed directly to the colonial power, in its own mother tongue.
232

Indeed, if in Calcutta the Company set up a Sanskrit college, the city’s

first _English_ college was born of a union of brown intellectuals,
businesspersons and dissenting white men. And where the state’s entire
budget for education was Rs 1,00,000, this contingent raised over Rs
1,13,000, almost wholly from ‘native’ benefactors. [233] A concerted effort by
Hindus—the institution was even branded ‘Hindu College’—to promote
Western learning, it would be said that ‘English Education was in a manner
forced upon the British Government’ by their actions. In 1827, a decade into
its founding, the college offered classes on ‘natural and experimental
philosophy, chemistry, mathematics, algebra’, with ‘Milton and


-----

Shakespeare’ on the side. [234] Where years later a governor would still
lament the absurdity of having ‘Natives rehearse Shakespeare’, [235] the fact
was that by 1831, Hindu College students displayed excellent ‘command of
the English language’—and, through it, ‘familiarity with its literature and
science’—exceeding ‘schools in Europe’. [236] Orientalists, though, remained
hostile. In Madras, an official wondered what the point was of introducing a
fraction of ‘native’ society to ‘the beauties of Shakespeare, of Milton and
with the learning of Bacon’ when the rest languished in ‘hereditary
ignorance’. The former would only grow ‘isolated’ from their countrymen.
237 A counter to this position, as voiced in the 1830s by Macaulay, was
market economics: ‘I know that your Sanskrit . . . books do not sell.’ But
‘English books . . . _do_ sell. I know that you cannot find a single person at
your Colleges who will learn Sanskrit . . . without being paid’ stipends. But
those ‘who learn English are willing to pay’ themselves. [238] Popular
demand was its own answer. [239]

The transition from Sanskrit to English was most pointedly expressed in

the mid-1830s, when the governor general ordered that state funding hereon
be reserved for only modern education in English, and that ‘artificial
patronage’ for ‘Oriental learning’ be gradually withdrawn. [240] Macaulay
endorsed the move. In his mind, English was to Indians what Greek and
Latin had been to Europeans some centuries ago: a potion for renaissance.
241 But how would knowledge touch the masses? In what are (in)famous
words in India, Macaulay advocated the creation of a section of ‘natives’
who ‘may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern’. A
‘class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in
opinions, in morals and in intellect’. It was this set—keen on Western ideas
and English—that would translate modern learning for the people, in their
vernacular languages. [242] The British, it was clear to him, had little capacity
to educate Indians—getting caught up in which language was best suited
was a waste of time. ‘What we now want are necessaries,’ wrote Macaulay.
‘We must provide the people with something to say, before we trouble
ourselves about the style which they say it in. Does it matter in what


-----

grammar a man talks nonsense?’ [243] In fact, Macaulay lambasted orientalist
peddling of antiquated Sanskrit as sheer irresponsibility. Would Indians
progress by learning ‘how they are to purify themselves after touching an
Ass, or what texts of the Vedas they are to repeat to expiate the crime of
killing a goat’? [244] No, the British must offer fresh ideas, or _nava vidya_ , as
Serfoji would have preferred. And for this they needed ‘native’
intermediaries, which, in a sense, was precisely what the Tanjore rajah had
also been.

Incidentally, such a class was on the rise—English-speaking ‘natives’,

transmitting new-found knowledge via local languages. [245] Master
Ramachandra (1821–80), for instance, taught at the government college in
Delhi, offering Western science in Urdu as well as original mathematical
research that expanded on ideas _within_ Indian traditions. [246] Later in the
century, B.P. Modak (1847–1906), a Deccan schoolmaster, authored a
chemistry textbook in Marathi; though ‘adulterated’ with English terms, he
would publish dozens more. [247] In this he was given the lead by B.S.
Jambhekar (1812–46), a Bombay professor, who, despite his early death,
achieved much: At seventeen, he translated Lord Brougham’s _A Discourse_
_on the Objects, Advantages, and Pleasures of Science_ , later advocating for
‘useful arts and sciences’ in the press. [248] In 1843, Dadoba Pandurang
(1814–82), also in Bombay published his _Dharmavivechan_ , combining
‘with Western rationalism India’s own religious dissent’. His Marathi
grammar would be of marked utility to translators. [249] Princes made
contributions too. The Travancore rajah mentioned before, Swathi Tirunal,


-----

set up an observatory and English school in his capital; his successors
would establish ‘scores’ of Malayalam-language institutions next. [250] One
of these heirs, Rajah Uthram Tirunal (1814–60), was an amateur physician
too, who delighted in parading his English-speaking daughter before guests.
For educating daughters was even more novel than teaching sons. [251]

Admittedly, these figures were few and scattered (and had their own class
and caste biases), [252] but they nonetheless shared a goal: to ‘transfer,’ as the
iconic Bengali educator Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar (1820–91) preferred,
‘the philosophy of the West into a native dress’. [253]

Indeed, if anyone feared that these men would be deracinated brown

sahibs, tending to mimic the West mindlessly, they need not have worried.
For while the likes of Jambhekar were consciously modern, they aspired to
an _Indian_ modernity. In Calcutta, for example, Akshay Kumar Datta (1820–
66), was a reputed Bengali textbook-writer, ‘Indianising European science’.
254 Covering everything from volcanoes to walruses in his work, 255 he also
edited a journal that made science familiar to brown audiences. Yes, on the
face of it he acknowledged Europe’s superiority: There was no doubt that
white men had pulled off technological miracles. Similarly, Hindus’ current
debilitation troubled him. They laboured, for instance, under the
misconception that whatever was traditional was best. [256] Custom, as we
saw in the Introduction, declared overseas travel polluting. Datta, however,
wanted ‘natives’ to open themselves to the world, and to abandon outdated
observances. Except, in urging them to do this, he did not simply suggest
following in Europe’s footsteps. Instead, culling from Greek sources down
to the Sanskrit epics, he argued that the Hindus’ _own_ ancestors had been
seafarers. [257] Significantly, Datta was not blind to the context in which
European science—which he so esteemed—came to India; he could see his
country’s political prostration. Or as he explained, the British conquest was
achieved by ‘lowly instincts’; white men showed ‘greed’, ‘self-love and
tremendous malice’. [258] That is, even as Europe’s technical achievements
were conceded, admiration was selective. [259] Accepting the value of
Western learning was not tantamount to legitimizing colonial _rule_ . Besides,


-----

the whole point of embracing foreign ideas was to revitalize ‘native’ society
—and a revitalized society would, it was a given, no longer require foreign
superintendence. [260]

This Indian propensity for selecting and accepting only those elements of

the encounter with the West as pleased them, was noticed by another cast of
men. With the government reluctant for decades to back elementary
education, especially in the vernaculars, missionaries had slid into that
space. In the south, a German father, for instance, starting in 1820,
established 107 schools in a space of fifteen years, catering to nearly 3000
students. [261] Soon after, colleagues opened 500 more in the area, bringing
38,000 students under instruction in total. [262] In Bengal, similarly,
missionaries through the Calcutta School Society ran over 200 schools by
1835, teaching some 5000 boys. [263] Of course, the education they supplied
was interlaced with religious propaganda, schools being perceived as
‘evangelistic agencies’. [264] The very act of learning English, one man wrote
in 1840, was calculated to leave students ‘tenfold less the child[ren] of
Pantheism, idolatry, and superstition than before’. [265] Another reported his
method of ‘giving [pupils] English phrases and sentences’ to learn. Only,
the sentences ‘might be arranged as to teach them whatever sentiments the
instructor should choose’. The hope was that some would form an
attachment to the Bible, and after conversion, ‘be made the instruments of
pulling down their own religion, and of erecting in its ruins the standards of
the Cross’. [266] In fact, as late as the 1870s, Madras authorities found
‘offensive’ allusions, targeting Hinduism and Islam, in textbooks used by
Christian organizations. Even a geography book urged the ‘people of India’
to accept the message of Christ ‘and endeavour to spread it’. [267]

And yet, despite the occasional conversion, most students proved adept at

digesting only parts of the academic fare. Missionaries often found that
children would memorize lessons, to pass exams. But hopes that they would
_understand_ them were disappointed. As a scholar suggests, ‘the [mere]
memorizing of texts’ was perhaps ‘an instinctive defence against a body and
form of knowledge that looked hostile to everything that was meaningful in


-----

the child’s environment’. [268] So too, instructors hoped that a scientific
curriculum would demolish their pupils’ faith in their gods; except those
pupils were not so malleable. On the contrary, according to a frustrated
master ‘no books would detain their attention for any considerable time
except the accounts of their own gods, and traditions’. [269] With very young
children, many parents did not worry about conversion—‘the missionary
may teach,’ it was noted, ‘as much Christianity as he pleases’ without
objection, because there was confidence that it would _not_ leave a mark. [270]

But even at higher levels, as early as the first decades of the nineteenth
century, a man of faith complained that despite exposure to science,
students felt no pressure to embrace the gospel. Yes, some of the more
‘preposterous errors’ and ‘revolting usages’ of Hinduism might be
abandoned but not anything further. [271] Indeed, one critic complained,
Hindus mastering ‘European languages, writings, and arts and sciences’
showed a distinct tendency to ‘father them on some of their own ancient
sages’. [272] And by the end of the century, though ‘Hinduism [had] been
simultaneously assailed by western education and by Christianity’, instead
of breaching it, Hindus were using new-found skills to actually ‘defend
their religion’. [273]

For missionaries, then, the religious and educational went hand in hand;

most of their ‘native’ wards, however, separated the strands, accepting
education minus direct religious baggage. Hindus, that is, desired
Enlightenment, but rejected the offer of _Christian_ Enlightenment. [274] And
this did not always require the invention at the hands of fabled sages
everything modern science had delivered. It could be done simply by
accepting that in life, different things served different purposes. Or as one
Hindu educator put it, traditional accounts that spoke of seas of nectar were
intended for the ‘praise of God’; _vigyan_ , or science, was a different
commodity. [275] The two occupied separate compartments, and one could
continue to value the Puranas as religious tradition, while accepting
contradictory scientific information in other respects. [276] This should not, as
such, be surprising. After all, science hardly upheld every tenet of

Christianity; yet, Christianity survived, and as we shall see in the next
chapter, even enjoyed a resurgence in nineteenth-century Britain. Indeed,
missionaries co-opted science to their cause, confidently publishing texts
with headings like ‘Botanical Objections to Hinduism’ and ‘Anatomical
Objections to Hinduism’, as if the Bible were exempt from similar
criticism. [277] By the end of the nineteenth century, in fact, Hindus would
actively consume works by Western thinkers who marshalled science and
reason in attacking Christian scripture. Or as a Madurai-based missionary
complained in 1888, in ‘abusing our religion’, Hindus ‘find ammunition
enough in the infidel tracts of [Charles] Bradlaugh and [Robert] Ingersoll,
which they freely use’. [278] Here again access to English was put to ‘native’
uses.

Ultimately, whether it was with education or Orientalism, the ways in

which Hindus responded did not meet their original promoters’
assumptions. Writing in 1817, for instance, a missionary lamented that
Indians accepted the Bible cheerfully, but not quite in fulfilment of
Christian hopes. Instead, some took it out of ‘curiosity’, others to barter it
‘in the markets’ and some for use as ‘wrapping paper’ even. [279] The man
probably felt a sense of crisis, but Hindus too were not as nonchalant as
they appeared. For into the nineteenth century, with British power secure,
missionary voices grew louder than ever before. Christian fathers were in
the streets, running schools, printing books and mounting, no matter their
own feelings of inadequacy, a more aggressive challenge than ever against
Hinduism. Orientalism also—even as it recrafted ‘native’ ideas of self—
assumed a missionary quality. Wilson, one of the leading Sanskritists of the
age, was transparent when he admitted in 1840 that in studying Hinduism,
one goal was to ‘overturn their [Hindus’] errors’. [280] F. Max Müller (1823–
1900), the celebrated Vedic expert, wrote of the Vedas as ‘the root’ of
Hinduism. [281] But while superior to living, Puranic traditions, this was, he
added nonetheless, ‘childish and crude’ [282] —to show Hindus ‘what that root
is, is, I feel sure, the only way of uprooting all that has sprung from it
during the last 3000 years’. [283] Many nodded in agreement. Or as a


-----

colleague wrote to Müller, ‘Your work will form a new era in the efforts for
the conversion of India . . . by enabling us to compare that early false
religion [of the Vedas] with the true.’ [284]

Which brings us to the third element in the remaking of Hinduism in the

nineteenth century, next to Orientalism and modern education: spectacular
conflict with missionaries.

 FOR GOD AND COUNTRY

In April 1853, a luxuriously produced copy of the Bible was placed before
Lord Dalhousie for his signature and inscription. It was intended as a
present for a high-born Indian, for whom the governor general entertained a
‘great fancy’. [1] ‘This Holy Book,’ the white man wrote to the brown, was
‘an inheritance richer . . . than all earthly kingdoms’—a uniquely snotty
remark to make to an adolescent who had just been deprived of his
kingdom, its riches—including the Koh-i-Noor diamond—and even the
company of his mother. [2] And yet, the gift was fitted to the occasion: A few
weeks prior, Duleep Singh (1838–93), the deposed maharajah of Lahore
and leader of the Sikhs, had converted to the Christian faith. It was a public
relations coup for evangelical missions in India, who for decades afterwards
advertised the submission of the son of the Lion of Punjab—Ranjeet Singh
—before the one true god. Tales abounded about how exactly the maharajah
was converted. When he was evicted from Lahore after the annexation of
his state, a graduate from a Christian mission school was chosen as one of
his attendants. Bhajan Lal, though Brahmin by birth, entertained Protestant
sympathies, and one day, Duleep Singh saw among his things the Bible.
‘What is this?’ asked the prince. When told it was the book of Christianity,
the maharajah evidently requested that a chapter be read. ‘Strangely
enough,’ the story went, ‘it was the chapter in Acts containing the account
of the conversion of Saul.’ And with that began the Sikh ex-monarch’s
transfer into the arms of Christ. [3]

It was an event of great consequence. In Calcutta, the British archdeacon

expressed hopes that Duleep Singh’s ‘conversion may have an important
influence on our missionary prospects’ in India. [4] Sympathetic press outlets
declared that the Company must now march against ‘ignorance,
superstition, moral debasement and misery’—all placeholders for ‘native’
religions—and spread Christianity. It would, they argued, be a victory to
‘eclipse [even] the glories of Plassy’ (sic). [5] The _Oriental Christian_
_Spectator_ proclaimed that this gain of the prince—‘no inappropriate
specimen of his nation’—would open up ‘remarkable opportunities’ to win
followers among Sikhs specifically. [6] Even the president of the Board of


-----

Control in London, expressed his hopes for ‘a civilized and Christian
empire’, and was ‘much satisfied’ when he learnt about the maharajah. [7] Of
course, the path to this moment had been paved carefully. When Duleep
Singh first expressed a desire to discard, as would be later stated, the
‘mummery, immorality and covetousness’ of his ancestral religion, [8] the
official line was that ‘no improper influence’ should be used to ‘induce His
Highness to abjure his original faith’. [9] Dalhousie meditated on the subject
for two whole years, and only when the maharajah’s guardian confirmed
that the boy was determined to switch religions was baptism arranged. The
great worry, naturally, was that any official enthusiasm on the British side
might provoke ‘native’ animosities. [10] The governor general was keen but
could not be _seen_ as keen.

This fear was warranted, because ‘native’ anxieties were indeed inflamed.

The deposed rajah of Coorg in southern India, whose daughter also
converted in British custody, [11] wryly remarked that Duleep Singh must
have been of ‘wonderful precocity’ given how he went from a nine-year-old
who had never ‘heard the word Christianity’ to forming ‘uninfluenced
convictions’ as a ward of the Company. [12] Decades later, the prince himself,
even after returning to Sikhism, continued to regard his conversion as a free
choice but hinted that he was placed in circumstances likely to encourage
this turn. He was, on the one hand, separated from his only surviving parent
—censured in the press as the Jezebel of Punjab [13] —who was prohibited
from corresponding with him; when they met after twelve years, she was
blind and shattered. On the other, during the years he spent under Company
control, he was given no instruction in his own religion, and few of his
countrymen from Lahore were permitted contact. [14] Indeed, when he left his
old capital, not a single copy of the holy book of the Sikhs, the Guru Granth
Sahib, was packed. [15] He was given no knowledge of ‘the history of his
country and family, and had,’ as a pamphlet he sponsored argued, ‘been
taught to look to the British Government as his paymaster as well as his
sole protector and guardian’. [16] His interest in Christianity, while born of
genuine curiosity, was at first only so serious that having vowed he would


-----

no longer play on Sundays, he did the exact opposite. When asked, the
teenager sheepishly said that he ‘forgot’ his recently stated, very solemn
convictions. [17]

In this situation, the influence of his superintendent, John Login,

consciously or not, was key. For the fact is that this devout Christian and his
family were all the society the maharajah was permitted for years, inclining
him perhaps to imitate them in lifestyle as well as in faith. [18] The first time
he broke caste taboos, for instance, in front of his retinue was when he
sipped from a glass used—and, thus, according to local beliefs, ritually
defiled—by Mrs Login. [19] And the government also privately began to prod
the prince towards a more radical break from his past. As a Company
higher-up wrote to Login in 1851:

It is his Lordship’s [Dalhousie’s] earnest hope that the boy’s spontaneous wish may prove
to be rooted and stable, and that he may imbibe with eagerness and perseverance that
knowledge of Christian truth which he has thus early and unexpectedly sought. To that
end our best and faithful exertions should now be steadily directed. We should content
ourselves with the consciousness that we are laboring for good, and with the hope that it
will in the end be fully and permanently secured. But in the meantime, his Lordship
enjoins upon all concerned that they abstain from trumpeting abroad either the nature of

their labours or anticipations of their issue. [20]

Dalhousie was as motivated by political goals as he was by religiosity. It
was ‘a remarkable historical incident,’ he wrote, ‘and if ever the finger of
God wrote upon the wall, it did in the sight of this boy’. [21] The
transformation of the maharajah ‘from darkness to light’ [22] was ‘in every
way gratifying’ to the governor general’s own evangelical sympathies. [23]

But importantly, since Duleep Singh was ex-king of the Sikhs, his
relinquishing their religion held strategic implications: ‘we could desire
nothing better for it destroys [the maharajah’s] possible influence for ever’
over that mass of warlike people. [24] There was no chance now of Duleep
Singh’s restoration; he was severed from his land, his subjects and culture.
And in this, Dalhousie saw the prelude to something greater. Ranjeet
Singh’s son was ‘the _first_ Indian prince of the many who have succumbed to
our power . . . that has adopted the faith of the stranger. Who shall say,’ he


-----

wondered, ‘to what it may not lead? God prosper the seed and multiply
it.’ [25] This desire for Christianizing India, expressed from the highest levels,
stood at an alarming distance from the caution advocated by Elphinstone,
Munro and Malcolm earlier in the century. In their time, when British
power looked less certain, ‘native prejudices’ were handled with care.
Dalhousie, in the 1850s, however, was restless, brusque even. [26] Imperial
authority was, to all appearances, tightly embedded and in a position
therefore to promote its own ideological programme. To view the Company
merely as a utilitarian entity transacting power and commerce was for small
minds. Instead, the governor general conceived of the British empire as a
means to disseminate the holy word also. By so doing the Company would
serve a taller purpose; with a little less self-doubt, it might achieve nobility
even. [27]

Dalhousie, of course, did his best to push this vision until his term ended

in 1856. And then the country responded: Within a year of his departure,
India erupted in revolt. [28]

About twenty years before the Great Rebellion, Daniel Wilson, the bishop
of Calcutta, stood on the deck of a boat on the Sutlej. Ranjeet Singh reigned
in Punjab on the river’s west, while the Company’s territories ended on the
eastern side. It was a border agreed to in 1809, and the British had relatively
imperfect information on the lie of the land in Sikh country. But this did not
prevent the bishop from making a dramatic gesture. As he sailed downriver,
Wilson gazed at Ranjeet Singh’s realm and crowed: ‘I take possession of
this land in the name of my Lord and Master, Jesus Christ.’ [29] His
companions might have been puzzled, because the Company seemed
unlikely to pick a quarrel with the Lion of Punjab; the Sikh kingdom would
implode only in the decade _after_ Ranjeet Singh’s death in 1839. But to
Wilson’s biographer, the bishop’s remark portended what was to come.
Given the ‘speedy’ nature by which the British took the region thereafter—


-----

exploiting infighting in the Sikh court in the 1840s—he saw proof of ‘how
faith has power with God’. [30] To seize these lands was Britain’s destiny;
‘Christian England’ only had to wish it, and the world would be delivered
by heavenly design. The Sikhs had looked formidable, but it was their white
neighbours across the Sutlej who were backed by divinity. Empire was no
longer about men doing politics. It became a holy mission entrusted to the
British, and it was the Company’s duty to spread the Christian message—
even if whole kingdoms fell in the course of this august pursuit. After all
these were ‘native’ states. They did not realize that Christian power
subjected them for their own best interests. [31]

For all the talk of destiny in the story around Bishop Wilson, though,

official attitudes towards Christianizing India featured much ambivalence
and hesitation. Formally, as early as 1698, the charter parliament granted
the Company for its trade in India, required it to support Protestant fathers
and to ‘instruct the Gentoos’ in faith. But as Ziegenbalg experienced with
the Danish in Tranquebar, Company men—fixated on profits—were not
enthusiastic about complicating commerce with religion. Where they were
mandated to have a clergyman aboard every ship of 500 tonnes and above,
they simply built their ships below that size; when asked to impart lessons
to ‘natives’, they interpreted this as meaning those Indians who worked for
them, rather than Hindus at large. [32] Groups at home were nettled by the
indifference. The SPCK—Society for the Promotion of Christian
Knowledge—lobbied London and presented proselytism as offering
political bonuses also. Making (Protestant) Christianity part of the export
merchandise to India, they argued, would prevent Britain’s rivals, the
(Catholic) French, from seducing Hindus into unholy alliances. [33] In an
argument that would be much repeated, it was claimed that turning ‘natives’
into Christians would cement British power; rulers and the ruled would
become one. [34] After Bengal, with its millions of souls, became Company
territory, calls for letting missionaries in to ‘save’ them grew. This was also
linked to shifts in public sentiment, including a reaction to the
Enlightenment and its elevation of reason over faith. British losses—its


-----

embarrassing expulsion from America in the 1770s, for instance—led to
murmurs that god was punishing its people for being tepid Christians. [35]

Britain, one bishop sermonized, had a ‘duty’ to convert all who lived under
its sway. [36] Power and wealth could scarcely be ends in themselves; that
would only birth sin. [37] What the country needed was purpose. ‘Civilizing’
its eastern subjects fit the bill—and the Bible, carried not far behind the
Company’s guns, offered the apparatus.

_Histoire Générale des Missions Catholiques_ (1846).

This sense of preordination pervaded even those not prone to religious

conquest. Into the early nineteenth century, claims began to appear that
there was something providential to the British subjugation of India. As one
journal rhapsodized: ‘What can be more astonishing, than that a handful of
Europeans, impelled not by the love of conquest, but by circumstances over
which they had no control, should have risen . . . from the situation of mere
adventurers, carrying on a petty trade . . . to the lordship of the greatest, the
most populous, and the most extensive empire, upon the face of the whole
earth?’ [38] Central to this was the growing myth of British superiority: The
white man’s character surpassed that of the brown; his religion was more
exalted than the latter’s archaic superstition; British values were shaping up
the age, while Indians languished in the past, helpless at navigating the
present. [39] Coinciding with the Industrial Revolution and material and


-----

technological developments in Europe, important minds bought into this
self-image of the West as natural leaders, showering gifts of liberty and
progress upon darker parts of the world. Where missionaries specifically
were concerned, all this change was a confirmation of the need for
revitalized religion. Revolution in France triggered fears of a similar
upheaval in Britain, for example, and to maintain stability, a return to faith
was advocated. [40] Inventions and ‘improvements’ were a mark of
achievement, but whether they were used for good or bad depended on
values—which also were anchored in religion. [41] As a new middle class
began to emerge, upsetting older norms in British society and its settled
elite, demonstrable piety became a currency for social mobility. And what
better way to show ‘good’ (bourgeois) values than by supporting projects to
‘save’ ignorant ‘heathens’ in faraway places? [42] Even as the British were
remaking India, then, India would catalyse a fresh impression of
Britishness. [43]

Among the earliest figures to urge diffusing Christianity in the

subcontinent was Charles Grant (1746–1823), a Company servant and
future director. Personal tragedy had made him a man of faith and a
committed mouthpiece for extending the benefit to Britain’s Indian subjects.
As early as 1784, Grant aired his belief that no matter how much ‘good’ the
British did—by way of law, stability and so on—if Indians’ _moral_ standards
were poor, it would lead nowhere. [44] Three years later, in association with
friends, he proposed government support for Christian missionaries.
Dismissing the so-called higher precepts of ‘Hindooism’—Grant was
evidently the first to use this term [45] —he argued that the whole religion was
‘an infinity of absurdities’. On this was heaped a selection of other
stereotypes: that India’s tyrannical rulers loved anarchy and that its people
were ‘universally and wholly corrupt’. In this state of affairs, if the British
had to govern, they would have to necessarily push a ‘Reformation of the
morals’. Indeed, ‘good Government’ required the people to possess qualities
only Christianity could supply; in their current state, they were ‘lamentably
destitute’ of even such basics as honesty and justice. [46] For all his passion in


-----

wanting to deliver Hindus from themselves, though, Grant’s proposal did
not fly. In 1790, Lord Cornwallis, then governor general, reiterated the
longstanding policy that the Company’s security rested on ‘native troops’;
to meddle in their religion would jeopardize security. [47] His successor also,
while wishing ‘eternal welfare’ upon Indians, warned that proactive support
to missionary work would ‘excite alarm’. [48] In the larger scheme of things,
then, politics prevailed over faith; Company men were Christians but not
Christian (or unpragmatic) enough to let faith dictate matters of state. [49]

But Grant was not defeated. In fact, over the next two decades, he would,

in coordination with allies, wage a propaganda battle in Britain to push the
missionary cause. Even as orientalists sang of the glories of ancient India,
its philosophies and (Sanskrit) literature, this parallel crop of men were
producing material that was ‘awful in its ethnocentric bigotry’, casting
Hindus as a class of infant-murdering, wife-burning debauchees, in
desperate need of reform. [50] Grant’s volley in his _Observations on the State_
_of Society among the Asiatic Subjects of Great Britain_ (1792) was ripe with
hostility. [51] Reminding the Company that it owed its successes to god, and
demanding its ‘warmest gratitude’, [52] Grant comprehensively denounced all
things Hindu. The average Hindu was congenitally defective, his character
displaying the worst of human tendencies: servility, cunning,
obsequiousness, abusiveness, slander, selfishness, malice, virulence,
barbarity, etc. These were people who sold their children into slavery for
cash—it did not matter that such things occurred during famines, which the
Company failed to alleviate [53] —and whose wives, for all their feigned
modesty, lacked ‘purity’. [54] If anything, India and its Hindus existed to
prove the West’s superiority. Thus, in Europe, there was a surplus of men of
good character; in India, meanwhile, not a single exhibit of ‘real veracity
and integrity’ could be located. Where in the West, deception aroused
shock, in India, it was a routine trait. William Jones and his ilk, preoccupied
with crumbling manuscripts, were naïve—the violence of the most ‘obvious
and popular tenets’ of living Hinduism laughed, tauntingly, in their faces. [55]

To support his polemic, Grant also threw in quotations from accounts by


-----

white men from the previous 100 years, including Company mandarins—
unimpeachable evidence, apparently, to back his catalogue of hereditary
Hindu sins. [56] Through all this, his principal thrust was simple: India _needed_
the British, even if neither party was yet persuaded of this.

Grant’s attack was a veritable chutney of old stereotypes that had long

been circulating (as seen in Chapter 1) and of contemporary evangelical
concerns. But while he did damage, his views were not swallowed
willingly. The Company, as before, had to balance ‘the world of domestic
politics’ in Britain along with ‘the world of British India’. [57] London was not
against missionary activities in principle, in 1752, for instance, authorizing
their men in India to give financial aid to Protestant fathers. But they left the
execution of such orders to local discretion—and officers on the ground
harboured reservations. [58] Which is why, even as Grant was decrying
Hinduism in Britain, his countrymen in India were—as we saw—
sponsoring temple festivals, giving gifts to deities, mimicking rajahs,
peddling ‘Hindu law’ and otherwise attempting to construct a bargain with
‘natives’. Where Grant and his supporters wished for their Christian world
to refashion the Hindu, Company officialdom saw in this a hazardous
collision of values, political institutions and religion. They had barely
managed to get comfortable in the country, and here was a proposal to try
and seize not just land but the minds and emotions of its people, through
spiritual crusades. Put off by their reluctance, Grant escalated the battle to
Parliament next. In 1793, his friend, William Wilberforce—celebrated for
his campaign against slavery, and who proclaimed Hinduism a ‘grand
abomination’—moved a resolution in the House of Commons. Declaring it
Britain’s ‘bounden duty’ to facilitate ‘religious and moral improvement’, his
hope was to have these goals listed in the Company’s charter, now up for
renewal. But the leadership at India House—the Company’s headquarters—
objected. Besides, Europe was unsettled after the French Revolution, and
some feared that spreading Christian ideas in India risked also transmitting
notions of liberty: a threat to British power. So, in the end, the charter was
renewed without the so-called ‘pious clause’. As Wilberforce said, ‘My
clauses thrown out . . . and our territories in Hindostan, twenty millions of


-----

people included, are left in the undisturbed and peaceable possession . . . of
Brama [the Hindu deity].’ [59]

But it was not a complete loss, and with time, the missionary cause

would thrive, setting the tone for the Victorian age with all its cultural
judgement and self-righteous stiffness. To begin with, Britain was
urbanizing, with an expanding working class. This segment was as
attractive to evangelical Christians as ‘heathens’, [60] evangelicalism being a
response to ‘the emergence of modern urban society’; a novel form of faith
for novel times, where spiritual authority was no longer the preserve of the
church. [61] Printing and the ease with which texts could now circulate,
backed by rising literacy, democratized religious practice. The Religious
Tract Society, for example, in the fifty years since its founding in 1799
‘produced nearly half a billion tracts, broadsheets, and handbills’. [62]

Evangelical Christianity conceived of each individual as a means for
spiritual and social rejuvenation. One did not need to be a priest or a
churchman; one could be a pensioner distributing tracts in taverns, or a cart
driver dropping pamphlets on the road—faith would piggyback on secular
life. [63] Nor was religion about listening to sermons; it had become a
_movement_ led by charismatic men of diverse origins, inviting people to
participate. For instance, among the first missionaries sent to India by the
Baptist Missionary Society (BMS, established 1792) was William Carey, a
shoemaker. [64] Some, in fact, lampooned evangelicals precisely for allowing
‘every inspired cobbler, or fanatical tailor’ to presume he had ‘a kind of
apostolic right to assist in the spiritual siege’. [65] One critic went so far as to
even call BMS men ‘detachments of maniacs’. [66] This did not deter
evangelicals from building, innovating and blending radical methods with
conservative ideas; change threatened the establishment but to them, offered
opportunity. [67] Religion, as it emerged from rarefied spaces into a world
where all rules were up for debate, saw also the rise of a ‘religious public’:
a large segment of laypeople interested in faith, and keen to serve. And if
Company and Parliament rebuffed their agenda, evangelicals cultivated this
very class with a near-entrepreneurial drive, to swell their clout.


-----

To be clear, the Company _did_ let a fair amount of missionary activity

pass. When Carey arrived in India, he attached himself to an indigo planter
with evangelical sympathies. While local authorities knew exactly who the
new man was and why he was in Bengal, on paper, they classed Carey as
merely an indigo maker. [68] In 1800, he learnt he could preach even in
Calcutta, so long as he avoided Government House. [69] In the peninsula,
governed from Madras, European missionaries had become a fixture over
previous centuries, so official attitudes were relatively relaxed. In 1806,
thus, agents of the London Missionary Society (LMS, established 1795)
reported how they had received every support from the administration. [70]

Officials too were torn between the contradictions of their position: A future
governor general wondered how ‘we who pay the Brahmins’ could deny
Protestants. [71] But given that vending faith was a lower priority than trading
goods and keeping order, much depended on individual officers’ attitudes.
U-turns occurred repeatedly. In the 1790s, thus, paranoia about French
ascendancy in Europe caused the Bengal authorities to view BMS
missionaries—some of whom espoused republican politics [72] —with
suspicion. [73] In 1806, at Vellore, mutiny by ‘native’ troops made the
Company more guarded. The British had standardized soldiers’ uniforms,
including turbans, moustaches, etc. But as was later noted, while nothing
‘could appear more trivial to the public interests than the length of the hair
on the upper lip of a sepoy, yet to the individual himself the shape and
fashion of the whisker is a badge of his caste, and an article of his religion’.
By interfering, rumours gained ground—not helped by missionary
peregrinations in the region—that the redesigned uniforms were a scheme
for mass conversion. [74] Again, evangelicals found themselves at the
receiving end of opprobrium. While cordiality was soon reestablished with
local authorities, in general these self-appointed white saviours continued to
operate in a climate of uncertainty. [75]

In Britain, meanwhile, something of a public feud began—a pamphlet

war of recriminations and verbal jousts. [76] In 1807, despite Grant’s best
efforts from inside the Company system as a director, his associates issued


-----

orders stating that, while not hostile to missionaries, they had no desire to
‘add the influence of our authority’ to religious work in India. [77] One critic
attacked these spiritual salesman as ‘madmen’ preaching a ‘puritanical rant
of the most vulgar kind’. [78] Of course, it was also convenient to blame every
kind of anti-British sentiment among Indians on them, but missionaries
supplied adequate cause for this. Some material from the BMS press, for
example, was so foul in its censure of Hindu gods and Islam that even Grant
was embarrassed. [79] But as renewal of the Company’s charter approached in
1813, the evangelical party saw a fresh window. The last time, twenty years
ago, they were a nascent force; now, gains had been made. Using all its
organizational muscle, the movement was able to excite public support for
the ‘pious clause’. Meetings were held, thousands of circulars issued and
petitions swapped across the country in a signature campaign. India _had_ to
be ‘saved’. [80] Parliamentarians also, observing the growth of the ‘religious
public’, for political self-interest felt they had to be mollified. [81]

Government, meanwhile, though still suspicious of freelance missionaries,
was warming to the idea of setting up an official outpost of the Church of
England in India, if for nothing else, to escape the allegation of being lazy
Christians. [82] So when in the summer of 1813, 908 petitions signed by
hundreds of thousands reached Parliament—‘the greatest number of
petitions ever presented’ till then—the direction of the wind was clear. [83]

And the missionary camp won: The Company’s latest charter featured a
clause on ‘religious and moral improvement’. The British were, from now
on required to afford, officially, ‘sufficient facilities’ in India to all who
wished to aid this cause. [84]

How did this turnaround occur? An important contributor was missionary

publications, which ranged from standalone travel accounts ‘revealing’ the
depth of misery in India, to exchanges in increasingly popular evangelical
journals on Britain’s duty to export religious enlightenment. It was just the
kind of emotional fodder to sway the public. Claudius Buchanan, a
Company chaplain who also served at the College of Fort William in
Calcutta, established to train young officers, [85] for instance, published


-----

_Christian Researches_ in 1811. Ostensibly a travelogue, it offered a colourful
(and coloured) picture of India. The author ‘knew’, thus, that he was
approaching the Jagannath temple at Puri because human bones were
strewn around this ‘Valley of Death’. The deity was the ‘Moloch of
Hindostan’ (a child-sacrifice craving pagan god in the Bible); temple
sculptures were ‘indecent’; when devotees sang, it was not the ‘tuneful’
Hallelujah but a ‘hissing’, and pilgrims voluntarily threw themselves to be
crushed under the deity’s chariot. Buchanan’s point was clear: to ‘know the
state of the people, look at the state of the temple.’ And if this significant
one was a carnival of sin, imagine, he urged readers, the habits of those that
congregated here. [86] They, not missionaries, were the madmen. Next,
Buchanan spoke of sati, listing precise numbers of women burnt near
Calcutta, evoking righteous disgust by adding how these crimes occurred to
the background music of drums and cymbals. Nobody could halt this, for
the Company ‘acquiesced in its propriety’. [87] In the name of security, the
British literally watched women burn. This was contrasted with Tanjore—
Serfoji’s seat—where there were ‘native’ Christians. Here, happily,
Buchanan saw ‘becoming dress, humane affections, and rational discourse’.
There were ‘no skulls, no self-torture, no self-murder, no dogs and vultures
tearing human flesh!’ ‘Christian virtues’ had transformed the ‘feebleminded Hindoo’: evidence of the ‘excellence and benign influence’ of the
Englishman’s faith. [88] In Bengal, under Company rule, that is, error
prevailed; in the south, meanwhile, under the nose of a Christian-friendly
_Indian_ prince, ‘natives’ were saved. [89] What more substantiation was
necessary to support the evangelical camp? [90]


-----

Such writing was oriented towards a broad goal: a change in Company

policy, making full use of the power of shame. Jagannath was, after all,
under British protection. A table showed sums ‘the English Government’
dispensed, including for the maintenance of dancing girls. ‘How much I
wish,’ Buchanan thundered, that the Company bosses in London ‘could
have attended the wheels of Juggernaut’ and seen what they condoned. [91]

The appeal of this kind of literature is clear: It entertained and shocked, but
most importantly, underlined the belief that the British—with the Bible—
were obliged to lift up the world. Its popularity was also not in doubt:
Within two years, in the run-up to the renewal of the Company’s charter,
Buchanan’s book went into a dozen reprints. [92] Even a quarter-century later,
_Christian Researches_ was inspiring young men to join the missionary
cause. [93] The author too was aware that he was catering to demand. In 1805,

his previous work, besides arguing for shining the Church of England’s
light on India, spoke of civilizing ‘natives’ as a matter of honour; of raising
‘ _our_ just and generous principles’ against ‘ _their_ base and illiberal
maxims’. [94] The appendices to this volume included pages on supposedly
normal local customs. Hindus, it was stated, fed children to sharks and
crocodiles; drowned their sickly relatives; performed bloody rites and so
on. [95] Equally, the much-discussed issue of security—the sternest argument
against missionary fervour—was dismissed. In Buchanan’s view, even in
‘ten centuries the Hindoos will not be as wise as the English’; raising their
moral stature would ‘never injure the [Company’s] interests’. In other
words, Christianizing India was not equated with liberating India; vassals of
Britain they were, and as such they would continue—only now in the good
books of god. [96] They themselves wanted it this way: Referring (selectively)
to Serfoji, Buchanan wrote how he positively wished for his ‘wicked
subjects’ to be turned into ‘honest and industrious men’. All with the aid of
pious souls from the West. [97]

But what stirred public interest was also the counterarguments. This

contest between opposing groups on the India question constituted its own
brand of what we see in televised news debates in India today; what is
called ‘infotainment’. For instance, Buchanan’s 1805 book provoked a
rejoinder in _A Vindication of the Hindoos_ (1808), by an unnamed Bengal
officer. [98] Offering an ‘impartial’ survey, the author argued that Hindus had
no need for Christian tutelage. They were a quite ‘correct and moral
people’; if there was superstition, this would recede without ‘rash’ foreign
interjections. [99] Where Buchanan exaggerated the worst of popular practice,
this critic cited sublime passages from Sanskrit texts like the Gita and the
orientalists’ favourite sastras. Page after page extracted content meant to
appeal to Christian sensibilities, at times elevating Hindu ideas over
Christianity. Many values evangelicals cherished were also shown to be
internal to ‘native’ traditions, thus. Additionally, quotations from Mughal
sources in praise of the Hindu ‘character’ were carried, as if saying that this
last set of conquerors recognized in Hindus virtues, not vice—and that the


-----

British must follow precedent. Moreover, the ‘Bengal Officer’ warned that
missionaries would attract only low castes; the church would grow
associated with degradation, not moral upliftment. [100] As for practices such
as sati, the wild numbers circulated by missionaries were based on lazy
data; it was _not_ a pan-Indian, mass practice, and to apply what happened in
fairly narrow circles to the totality of Hindu culture was mischief. [101] This
did not, of course, end the debate: Buchanan’s votaries eviscerated the
_Vindication_ . A review in the _Christian Observer_ , for instance, expressed
amusement that its author held Hindu and Christian ideas to be on an equal
footing; that he could not see how Christianity alone, ‘of all religions’, was
designed to ensure the ‘happiness of the [greatest] mass of the people’. [102]

Put simply, Christian ideas were not, and could never be, up for debate.
They set the terms against which cultures elsewhere would be
interrogated. [103] Or in the acid words of the historian John Pemble, the
British were determined to ‘civilize others, not to civilize themselves’. [104]

What is instructive here, though, is that even in defending Hindus,

friendly white men resorted to cliché and familiar tropes. Indomaniacs
romanticized the country, focusing on texts and ideas; those peddling
Indophobia picked on the most outrageous, ‘exotic’ aspects of practice to
make their case. [105] In this lay the beginnings of what would guide most
future understandings of Hinduism. This was either a spiritual,
otherworldly, philosophical faith, pinned to writings in Sanskrit; or it was,
at the other extreme, a wild raft of superstitious, devil-worshipping cults.
The spectrum of ideas and practice, and their constant negotiations and
intertwined coexistence, was lost amid these stark posts. [106] Hinduism, as it
was imagined now, had no history, it could not be dynamic and it could not
have evolved, or be subject to diversity. It was either this or that—both
wickets being fixed by white disputants. Indeed, it might be argued that this
was not even wholly about India but a debate on _Britain_ : its ideology as an
emerging imperial state, and its struggle to refigure contradictions born of
change, technology and religious ferment. But given that the British were in
power, their narratives of the world would gnaw at Indians also. William


-----

Jones had, romantically, observed how the ‘greatest singularity of the
Hindoo religion’ was that it did not persecute ‘those of a contrary
persuasion’. All views were ‘acceptable to the Supreme Being’ and each
‘adapted to the country where it is established’—a line Hindus took with
Ziegenbalg also, as we saw. [107] But now, itself faced with harassment,
Hinduism would acquire a new, defensive avatar. To regain agency, brown
men—especially those exposed to the colonial state—would also place their
religion in the white man’s prism. It was like playing ball on a Christian
field; Christianity laid the ground on which Hindus constructed their
defence. Hinduism would, in key respects, be Christianized, internalizing
that distinction between what was ‘good’ within and what ‘bad’. Debates
would begin among ‘natives’ on ‘true’ Hinduism and mass ‘corruption’.
They too would jettison the amorphous spectrum, reimagining faith as a
defensible monolith; as a fortified, Protestant Hinduism.

Interestingly, however, the 1813 victory in Parliament for the missionary

lobby was incomplete. For the new clause still upheld ‘the authority of the
local Governments’ in filtering European access to India. In effect, that is,
missionaries would continue to require permission and licences to operate;
the subcontinent’s gates had _not_ been thrown open to all. [108] So too the
‘natives’ right to ‘free exercise of their religion’ was affirmed, hinting again
that government was not keen to meddle in these matters from the perch of
official policy. [109] Indeed, evangelical groups were soon to find that there
was barely an improvement from earlier: As the historian Penelope Carson
has shown, licences could be denied, and in some cases, they specified
provinces, preventing access to others. Permission was contingent on what
the government deemed good behaviour, and so, could be withdrawn.
Similarly, while there was now an official Church of England bishop in
Calcutta, the first occupant of that post was himself cold to evangelical
societies—in his view, they trampled on his turf. [110] Of course, the
authorities did partner with missions in areas like education but remained
on guard to ensure that textbooks produced via such projects did not bear
naughty Christian content. And in Madras, when evangelical publications


-----

lashed out at local culture, they were promptly censored. [111] As late as 1834,
when the bishop of Calcutta—now someone well-disposed to evangelicals
—argued for lighter civilian oversight over spiritual traffic in India, the
governor general demurred. Referring to his predecessors’ ‘wise policy’, he

112
spoke of ‘danger’ if government lost control over ‘indiscreet or overzealous’ religious professionals. The bishop—the very man who would
theatrically ‘claim’ the Punjab from a boat—was not pleased. This official
church representative too began to doubt the British state’s moral fidelity. [113]

The propaganda war, therefore, continued even after 1813. This,

interestingly, had its peculiar economics, demonstrating how much Indian
affairs were dictated by domestic events in Britain. The associations and
societies involved in the evangelical cause functioned in one market. By the
middle of the nineteenth century, several boasted high revenues: the BMS at
£25,000 and the LMS at £75,000, for instance. [114] But they also competed
for attention from the same pool of public interest. [115] Tales from India, with
tragic widows, pagan customs, blood sacrifices and more were a way to
hook interest. [116] Illustrations began to appear in missionary publications, to
sustain the reader’s animation. For instance, an 1816 issue of the Church
Missionary Society (CMS, established 1799) periodical featured a fakir’s
image. A servant of the true god, the text declared, was ‘so affected by the
folly and superstition’ of this mendicant that he had a drawing made so ‘we
Christians may see what a sad state the Heathen are in, and do all we can to
open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the
power of Satan unto God’. [117] The next year, a picture of Jagannath
appeared, with a note on its ‘monstrous’ nature; this feature promised to,
next time, also show an engraving of the chariot before which ‘deluded’
idolaters committed ritual suicide. [118] By Christmas 1817, a depiction of
human sacrifice, complete with chopped head, and a trail of blood, made it
to print, with an account of the ‘indecent mirth and filthy singing’ that
accompanied this rite. And, of course, the point of these pictures—and the
expectation by way of returns—was clarified: Good Christians must ‘make
great efforts . . . to teach [these people] better’. [119] Given that the CMS


-----

journal was a market leader—printing 4,00,000 copies annually by 1824—
its hold on British imagination cannot be overstated. [120] The India debate
was being arbitrated, that is, not by experts or on terms of sobriety, but by a
press with religious bones to pick and zeal to market.

Of course, while missionaries may truly have been revolted by some ugly

practices [121] —human sacrifice did happen now and then, [122] and if sati


-----

figures were exaggerated, [123] that sati occurred cannot be denied, including
of infant ‘widows’ [124] —in constructing Hinduism for their British audience,
they betrayed ‘the relish of a voyeur’. [125] And this for reasons not wholly
spiritual. As the scholar Geoffrey Oddie has shown, a large portion of the
evangelical readership was lower class. It was therefore assumed that along
with simple language, the focus of missionary journals must be on lurid
externalities rather than complex (read boring) theological questions. [126]

Missionary writings were not an exercise in academic comparison but a
venture to expand the ‘religious public’: the economic and political
backbone for evangelicalism. This, in fact, handicapped voices resisting the
onslaught: _Their_ focus on texts and ideas—as seen in the _Vindication_ —
could convince discerning readers but not the broader mass. Sense, after all,
sells less than the sensational; a simplistic picture in black and white soared
above verbose attempts at nuance. [127] Besides, editors, whose ‘all
consuming task was to encourage subscriptions’, printed chiefly such
reports as offered a cocktail of pity, disgust and horror to persuade readers
to open their purses. [128] And once a set of themes began to ‘work’, they
were recycled relentlessly, as in earlier centuries. [129] Jagannath, thus, was a
recurring tale of perversion, with Buchanan cited repeatedly. Even wording
was copied, growing ingrained: Three decades after _Christian Researches_
appeared, Bishop Wilson also, when describing a visit to Puri, called it a
‘valley of death’. [130] Of course, he had fresh censure to add, but he did not
hesitate to credit Buchanan as the original fount of his feelings. So also with
sati, statistics made little difference; it had set itself in public opinion as
essential to Hinduism. [131] A subcontinent, with a formidable range of
customs and beliefs, much debate and disagreement, was reduced, in this
way, to an inventory of violent but arresting stereotypes. Again.

Ideologically slanted (and commercially profitable) writing on Hinduism

continued, therefore, steadily nurturing condescension among the British.
Some books, such as William Ward’s _A View of the History, Literature, and_
_Religion of the Hindoos_ (1815), attempted to guilt those who were still
suspicious of missionary narratives. [132] Let these apologists, Ward declared,


-----

‘assist the bramhuns . . . while the fire is seizing the limbs of the young and
unfortunate Hindoo widow’. Or ‘join the dance, stark naked . . . before the
image of [the goddess]’. [133] The language of moral outrage worked: Ward’s
book too enjoyed multiple editions and wonderful sales. It hardly mattered
that the author’s estimate of 10,000 yearly satis in Bengal was based on
assumptions and mathematical gymnastics; this when the actual record was
378 in the year of his book’s printing. [134] Others used what they portrayed as
reason to make a comparison. George Mundy in _Christianity and_
_Hindooism Contrasted_ (1827), thus, tried to demonstrate how the Bible
projected a consistent idea of god; the sastras, however, were confused,
with ‘fictitious’ deities. The Christian god was pure, while Hindu pretenders
were ‘addicted to every vice’, requiring ‘profane songs’ and ‘indecent
dancing’—how could anyone with the thinnest claim to common sense not
tell which faith was superior? [135] Then, lastly, there were translations like
the French missionary Jean-Antoine Dubois’s _Description of the Character,_
_Manners, and Customs of the People of India_ (1817). Allegedly plagiarized,
this book, with detailed notes on caste and Brahmins, was even purchased
and published by the Company to serve as an official manual. But despite a
relatively calm tenor, Dubois too did not hesitate to suggest that there was
ultimately little keeping ‘natives’ from cannibalism. He urged nonintervention, that is, not because Hindu culture had merits but from fear that [136]
experiments to reform would make a bad product worse. For Hindus simply
would not surrender their odious ancestral proclivities. [137]

But perhaps the most damaging of this literary surge was James Mill’s

three-volume _The History of British India_ (1817)—a ‘judging history’ he
published without once setting foot in the country it decried. This, in the
historian Thomas Trautmann’s words, would become ‘the single most
important source of British Indophobia’ hereon. [138] Mill, entirely guided by
existing European writings as research material, in a sense bookended what
had begun in the age of Warren Hastings. The scholarly foundation of Mill’s
critique, in fact, was works which had come into circulation from that
period—writings we know were garbled and full of limitations. [139]


-----

Unsurprisingly, with imperfect sources, Mill’s conclusions too were
deformed. For instance, his denunciation of ‘Hindu law’, which he used to
demonstrate that Hinduism, even in its most authentic, original sources—so
attractive to orientalists—was execrable. As proof he cited such
prescriptions in Sanskrit like one throwing adulterous women to be torn
apart by dogs. [140] This when, in _practice_ , adultery in Maratha country, to
give a single illustration, was addressed primarily through fines and
imprisonment. [141] Nobody, that is, was shredded. Because, however,
translations of ancient texts by white men were certified as ‘law’, they
became Mill’s truth. It was this ‘reliable’ information—which most Hindus
would not have recognized—that the man used to lambast them, both in the
past and present. He might as well have cited historical fiction. Instead, Mill
—who had once trained to become a pastor [142] —was touted as a formidable
expert and awarded a job at India House in 1819. [143] And, his _History_ ,
which at one point likens the Hindu to ‘the eunuch’ for excelling in the
‘qualities of a slave’, became prescribed reading for trainee civil
servants. [144] Even before they sailed out from Britain, that is, officers had
reason to prejudge India. The Hindu world, as constructed by the West and
its itinerant saviours, simply could not escape condemnation. [145]

In December 1836, John Poynder (1779–1849), a Company shareholder,
delivered an impassioned oration before fellow owners of India stock in
London. His topic was the pilgrim tax, levied on all who visited the greatest
Hindu shrines in the subcontinent. It was a traditional impost, the British
having inherited the system from ‘native’ rulers they displaced—at Puri
from the Marathas, for example. Not surprisingly, this infuriated
evangelicals. By now, this lobby was even stronger, having won a
substantial triumph: The renewal of the Company’s charter in 1833
removed all preconditions to work in India. Gates limiting missionary
access were finally dismantled. So, the movement pressed other demands—


-----

such as shirking profits from idolatry. The numbers, Poynder contended,
were shameful. Four shrines alone had, between 1812 and 1834, delivered a
million pounds sterling, after all expenses, to the Company through pilgrim
taxes. [146] Citing everyone from Buchanan and Grant to Mill and Ward,
Poynder decried this as ‘sin’. [147] Company men, of course, had a different
point of view, and were loath to forfeit this surplus. Early gains from
Jagannath alone, for instance, had funded infrastructure projects, including
a military road. [148] But for missionaries, this balance sheet was troublesome.
After all, whenever they railed against idolatry, Hindu interlocutors coolly
pointed to shrines maintained by the Company; to the revenue the British
smilingly amassed from their gods. [149] To mollify evangelicals, then,
London in 1833 had also issued orders terminating the pilgrim tax and
ending Company participation in temple affairs. But in what looked to
critics like deceit, they left the timeline for implementation to men on the
ground. [150] And three years later, their officers were conveniently
vacillating.

Lord Auckland, then governor general, tried to position things in a

manner that would pacify critics like Poynder. The Company, he explained,
only protected Hindu institutions as the law preserves ‘a prostitute from
robbery or a brothel from burglary’. It was not endorsing idolatry, only
doing its bare minimum by way of duty. As for profits, missionaries should
be relieved that instead of enriching the ‘Hindoo priesthood’, the pilgrim
tax subsidized ‘useful’ schemes. [151] But even if Auckland dismissed the
fuss, there is no denying that many of his own subordinates were now on
the missionary side. As the ‘religious public’ grew at home, men reared
within began to populate Company ranks, carrying evangelical motives into
the state machinery. [152] In fact, by 1834, one of Charles Grant’s sons would
be governor of Bombay: the place where Elphinstone had, in the previous
decade, pushed a policy of conciliation. [153] James Thomason, who would
govern the North-Western Provinces for ten years from 1843, was the son
of a Company chaplain. [154] The father of Lord Macaulay—who sat on
Auckland’s council—actively supported the 1813 campaign for the ‘pious


-----

clause’, personally distributing 1,00,000 circulars. [155] General Henry
Havelock, who would play a key military role during the Great Rebellion,
was son-in-law to Joshua Marshman, a BMS colleague of Carey’s. [156]

Missionaries, in fact, actively began to locate sympathizers in government,
adjusting strategies in India accordingly. The LMS, thus, chose Salem, in
Tamil Nadu, for a new post because its British collector was known to be a
devout evangelical Christian. [157] More generally, debates on India and
evangelicalism had formed the backdrop during formative years for an
increasing number of officers. Lord Dalhousie, for instance, who cheered
Duleep Singh’s conversion, was born one year after _Christian Researches_
first appeared. The future governor general’s Britain was very different
from Warren Hastings’s world; their perception of Indians too diverged. [158]

This accretion of internal pressure—with a comparable dilution of

empathy for the Company’s ‘native’ subjects—had been in the making for
decades. As far back as 1802, when Carey and Buchanan taught at the
College of Fort William, its students (future civil servants) were writing
essays that spoke of ‘thousands’ of ‘human victims’ annually slaughtered in
India for ‘horrid deities’ at ‘polluted altars’. [159] In the 1810s, the British
representative at the Travancore rani’s court not only made her give grants
to the CMS but also had missionaries appointed judges in her state. The
man was only imitating his predecessor—an uncle of Macaulay’s, who had
used _his_ influence to promote the LMS. [160] In 1822, the governor of Madras,
similarly, complained that a sub-collector at Bellary not only showed
‘prejudice’ against ‘natives’ but also crossed a line by using state resources
to distribute ‘moral and religious tracts’. Worse, the man was unrepentant
when accused of being a missionary in civilian clothing; instead, he cited
scripture and divine authority for his actions. [161] Indeed, a future Madras
governor himself would, less than twenty-five years after this, endorse
employing the Bible as a school textbook. [162] So also, the use of Company
officials and troops in organizing temple celebrations—requiring vast
numbers of peasants to be commandeered—generated uneasiness. [163] Was it
healthy to expect a white official, as at Surat, to propitiate annually a local


-----

river goddess with coconuts? [164] Increasingly, responses were in the
negative. One man refused to show himself at a festival as it happened on a
Sunday. [165] Another in 1838 resigned on the count that when joining the
civil service, he had not signed up to ‘assist in, and uphold, the idolatrous
worship of India’. [166] In Dhaka, officials openly defied orders to let a case of
sati proceed; it created a moral conundrum for the judge deciding the matter
too, who observed that as a man he rejoiced at the officers’ stand, but in his
formal capacity he could not brook disobedience. [167] Even so, whatever
superiors said, much remained contingent on who was on the ground.
Sometimes a senior officer might aid missionaries, while a junior thwarted
them. [168] If, as occurred in Peshawar in the early 1850s, one official was
hostile to evangelicals, his successor might reverse the attitude, showing
welcome. [169] Within Company ranks too, then, a war of principles was
underway. [170]

In these circumstances, even Auckland—who disagreed with the ‘spirit

of fanaticism’ that had crept into the British government—had to
grudgingly acquiesce to change. [171] Tolerance for the Company acting as
‘the dry nurse of Vishnu’ was dwindling. [172] Under pressure at home, the
directors were practically forced to reiterate their orders, and by 1840, the
pilgrim tax was terminated in Bengal. [173] Bombay and Madras followed
suit. [174] In the latter presidency, over the coming years, the state withdrew
from the religious space: Small village shrines were handed over to priests,
larger ones to local committees, major pilgrim centres to influential
community leaders and so on. [175] This general policy, however, upset
Indians: In 1831, towards the end of his life, Serfoji took it as an affront that
white officials were absenting themselves from Tanjore’s festivals—after
all, these religious events were pregnant with political symbolism also. [176]

Other old practices too were dying: The firing of salutes by British troops at
Hindu events, their placing of ritual offerings (like those coconuts at Surat)
before regional gods and so on. Everything that, earlier in the century, was
construed as a small price to pay for power was now considered wicked. [177]

Or as one Company man remarked to a subordinate, ‘every act’ they were


-----

obliged to perform in connection with Hindu temples made them liable, as
_Christians_ , to the charge of idolatry. [178] The British no longer felt any
incentive to fit the ‘native’s’ world; it was the ‘native’ who had to reconcile
to rescripted rules. Auckland was distressed: Allowing ‘mistrust’ to emerge
about the Company’s pledge of ‘toleration’ was unwise. [179] But by
Dalhousie’s era, even at the top there was little room for such sensitivities.
Not only did this governor general support evangelicals, he was also viewed
as endorsing them when he granted converts the right of inheritance in their
original families. Hindus filed thousands of petitions in protest. [180] One went
so far as to ask: ‘If the eldest son of the King of England becomes a
Catholic, will he be allowed to inherit the throne?’ [181] But there was no
answer because India’s rulers were no longer listening.


-----

The BMS’s first convert, as depicted in George Smith’s

_The Life of William Carey_ (1885).

Understandably, wrath towards missionaries was on the ascendant in

Hindu circles, especially among high-caste groups. As early as 1800, when
the BMS acquired its first convert—a carpenter—a crowd of 2000
reportedly gathered in objection. [182] In the south, Catholics were not as
much of a fear—de Nobili’s strategies were still in place—but Protestants,
backed by power and ‘more aggressive’ in tone, looked a threat. [183] The
conversion of Brahmins was advertised with grating triumphalism: As
Carey remarked, ‘What great thing is it to have a Carpenter and a distiller
reject their cast [sic]?’ [184] It was the cream they
craved. Zeal showed, and not always tastefully: One BMS proponent was
compared, by his own colleague, to a hawk eyeing its prey, when he
identified potential targets for preaching. [185] Another actually went insane


-----

on finally procuring two converts after years of toil. [186] Missionaries also
evinced a devious delight in their scholarly pursuits: The BMS project of
translating the Ramayana was combined with joy that ‘Satan’ was to ‘be
shot in his own bow’; sales of these ‘destructive fables’ would ‘supply a
fund for circulating the oracles of Truth’. [187] (A Hindu, meanwhile,
reciprocated by describing the BMS’s Hindi-language Bible as ‘milk in a
vessel of dog’s skin’. [188] ) Remarkably, even at this late date, dislike for
Protestant reverends stemmed from the insistence that Christianity was the
_only_ path to god. The whole of the Hindu world was built on plurality. The
Christian picture of things, however, seemed totalitarian. So, over a century
and a half after Ziegenbalg was told off in the south, a northern Hindu critic
would also question this presumption. Nobody, it was confirmed, objected
to Christ, whose teachings were ‘nectar for the soul’. ‘But that _only_ Christ
was the saviour’ was hubris. [189] Missionaries would not—could not—give
way. And their unyielding stance triggered Indian restlessness. A CMS man
in Benares—holiest of Hindu sites—noticed this in the 1840s. Ten years
ago, preachers were laughed at; told ‘no one will believe you’, he reported.
Now, however, Hindus admitted: ‘You have already conquered our bodies,
and you are in a fair way of conquering our minds also.’ [190] It sounds like a
compliment, but the fact is that the missionary had become a threat. [191]

Naturally, many on the ‘native’ side now prepared to resist. This could

take the form of jeering and tearing up of pamphlets, as in 1836, in
Nagapatam in Tamil country. [192] Or, as occurred in Travancore when that
evangelical British agent retired, the Christians he had installed in high
places were sacked. [193] One text even constructed a Puranic-style narrative
in which hell faces a serious depopulation due to Hindus’ devotion to their
gods; it is to restore ‘cosmic balance’ that a false avatar, Jesus, arrives to
hoodwink people—and resupply hell with waylaid souls. [194] But a key
means was the public disputation. Charles Leupolt, that Benares-based
CMS missionary, noted how bazaars, streets and riverbanks were all fields
for toil. [195] Predictably, arguments flew back and forth. Once, for instance,
Leupolt got into a debate on god’s nature. According to a Hindu school of


-----

belief, the supreme exists in all beings and things; for Leupolt, however,
this was equal to cutting god into pieces. There was, he stressed, a
distinction between god and his creation. But his Hindu discussant brushed
this off. The sun, he declared, was only one; and yet, it could be reflected in
a thousand vessels. This did not mean there were a thousand suns, only that
the same power manifested in myriad ways. [196] Leupolt was not convinced.
If god were present in all beings, every thief could blame his thievery on
divine play. [197] There was something very immodest and shameful, he
believed, in the Hindu claim that god existed in all of them. His memoirs
also speak of other obstacles. Once a fakir appeared, anxious to convert,
only to be dragged away. Another time, Leupolt was talking to a crowd,
until interrupted by a monkey dressed in the British soldier’s uniform, sent
in by miscreants. Even Hindus amenable to becoming ‘disciples’, insisted
they should not be branded Christians or made to renounce caste. [198] This
might have been an option for de Nobili two centuries ago but not for the
CMS man; so, sympathetic candidates also turned away. [199]


-----

A Christian missionary preaching at a Hindu festival from the CMS’s

_Missionary Papers_ (1851).

Soon, Hindu–missionary debates, in fact, became grand spectacles,

watched by heaps of people. Bombay was the scene of many such events.
The _Oriental Christian Spectator_ reported one from 1830, between a
‘native’ supporter of John Wilson—a Scottish evangelical—and Brahmins,
held over several days, with a hundred listeners. As ‘the onion and musk are
known by their odour’, vented the Indian convert, so Vishnu’s avatars could
be separated from Christ. This time the argument we witnessed in Benares
was inverted: The Hindu side accused _Christians_ of dividing the almighty
into three—as the father, the son and the holy spirit. To this, the convert
brought up the analogy of the sun! There was the sun, its light and heat, and
yet, it was all one. Wilson stepped in to highlight the absurdity of the
incarnations: One of them arrived to retrieve the Vedas, lost when the god


-----

of creation was asleep. But how could god, who was omnipresent, not know
the hiding place? Could god sleep? When, another time, the Hindu party
repeated their proposition that there were many paths to salvation, Wilson
disagreed. There was one god and he could only have created a single set of
laws—this was no buffet. [200] To which a Brahmin demanded: ‘why did God
not give [these laws] to us’; did god make a mistake or had he _intended_ for
Hindus to be distinct? Clearly the debate was heading nowhere, and by the
fourth day, only thirty men stayed listening. [201] One thing was obvious,
however: Wilson and his aide had mastered Puranic material, skilfully
summoning evidence from within Hindu traditions. In excoriating the use of
idols, thus, they confidently quoted Sanskrit critiques of the practice. [202]

Besides, the entire exchange was held in the region’s Marathi language,
which these men had painstakingly learnt. [203] The Hindus realized they
would have to match this rigour. [204]

A worthy opponent appeared the next year, and a six-day debate

followed. In fact, after the public performance, Morobhat Dandekar, the
Brahmin speaker, printed his arguments in his _Hindudharmasthapana_ ( _The_
_Foundations of Hinduism_ , 1832). Dandekar thought it puzzling that
missionaries complained so much about idolatry—as if Hindus held the
images themselves to be gods—when, in fact, it was a means to make
divinity accessible. Their very fundamental understanding of the religion, in
other words, was flawed. On avatars, Dandekar cited the tripartite Christian
idea of god. ‘If . . . these three Divinities occasion no bewilderment of [the]
mind,’ how, he asked, ‘can the worship of Rama . . . and other gods
occasion . . . bewilderment’? [205] Moreover, as Hindus collected in temples,
Christians gathered regularly ‘to take a piece of bread . . . muttering a few
words to eat it up . . . drink spirits . . . [and] pour water on the head’. [206] In
principle, then, temple worship was similar to attending church. On Christ,
while Dandekar thought it estimable that he suffered pain on a cross for
humankind, Hindu gods achieved those precise results without ‘submitting
to a reproachful death’. [207] That is, to argue that Jesus was superior because
he bled, and that Hindu avatars, on account of merrier lives, were inferior

was silly; they just did their job better. [208] But more to the point, why did
god _let_ Christ suffer? ‘What! Had he no other ways of saving the world?’ It
was Christianity which, by arguing that god’s hands were tied, brought an
‘indelible stain’ on his greatness. [209] Hinduism was more logical. It
perceived the almighty as a ‘shopkeeper’, who ‘with a view of bringing all
the customers’ to his counter took diverse forms. [210] But then again,
Dandekar finished, it was ‘the way of all men to expose the faults of others .
. . never to look at their own’—and Christian missionaries were particularly
susceptible to this defect. [211]

Naturally, Wilson felt this written charge had to be addressed, publishing

_An Exposure of the Hindu Religion_ (1832). It followed the standard
approach: There were false religions and only one that was true; Hindu
ideas, such as that the earth rested on a tortoise, were puerile; the Puranas
were puddles of confusion; its deities had promiscuous tastes and so on. [212]

To this, Narayan Rao, a friend of Dandekar’s, issued his
_Svadeshadharmabhimani_ ( _Espouser of His Country’s Faith_ , 1834). [213] His
effort was to demonstrate that the Bible ‘even on its own terms’ was a
mess. [214] Why did god rest after creation; was he lazy? He made man in his
own image; did that mean god looked human, suggesting that Christians
too, effectively, had an idol in mind? Why did he not create Eve as he did
Adam—why steal a rib? [215] In what was becoming a tedious pattern, Wilson
returned fire with _A Second Exposure of the Hindu Religion_ (1834). Sanskrit
too was deployed. John Muir, a civil servant with evangelical leanings,
produced the _Matapariksa_ ( _An Examination of Religions_ , 1839), which
provoked three responses from pandits over six years. [216] One of these
soberly reasoned with Muir; another, citing Valtaya, Hiyuma and Pena—
Voltaire, Hume and Thomas Paine!—was incandescent, casting aspersions
on Jesus, adding that the real spiritual journey was from Christianity _to_
Hinduism. [217] But a transition to print did not terminate public disputations:
As late as 1857, Bombay witnessed a clash between a Hindu thinker,
Vishnubawa Brahmachari, and missionaries. Conducted before 2000
spectators, their verbal tourney lasted months. [218] Wit helped. When told


-----

that his intellect equalled that of an ant against an elephant, the Brahmin
smiled: ‘[A]n ant can creep into the trunk of an elephant and cause [its]
death.’ [219] In this instance, the Hindus claimed victory, for after a point, the
missionaries did not return. [220]

Unexpected reversals of this type could afflict Hindus also, though.

Among the critics of Muir’s Sanskrit treatise was a man called Nilakantha
Goreh (1825–95). He began his spiritual life as a staunch Brahmin—
evidently, he refused to study at the Government Sanskrit College in
Benares because this entailed dealing with Europeans. [221] So too, he gave up
the worship of Siva for Vishnu, because the latter, he believed, better fit the
exacting standards of the scriptural corpus and Hindu theological principles.
In fact, Goreh attacked Siva’s character, not unlike missionaries, inviting
worry that he might one day defect. [222] Yet, the young man’s first opinion of
missionaries was decidedly poor: ‘He heard [them], only to despise, or to
show his superior knowledge and skill,’ we are told. [223] Why, he was only
twenty when he produced his rejoinder to Muir’s _Matapariksa_ —the
‘sharpest’ of the three that appeared. [224] Since Sanskrit had a small audience,
he next composed prose in Hindi, poking fun at Christianity. [225] He actively
went out to argue with a CMS missionary hoping to ‘compel them either to
leave the country or to confine themselves to the instruction of the
Christians’. [226] Except that by 1848, following engagement with the CMS, it
was Goreh who became Christian. This of course came as a shock to his
Hindu kin and the community in Benares. [227] When his wife was baptized—
dying days after—they blamed it on trauma from being forced to venerate
the Bible. [228] But the real concern was that Goreh, a Sanskrit scholar, would
become a dangerous instrument in the missionary camp. And indeed, the
man would eventually publish _A Rational Refutation of the Hindu_
_Philosophical Systems_ (1862). [229] Coming from an ex-Brahmin, the attack
was sharp; it seemed almost a betrayal. [230]

Though missionary gains in numbers remained modest, high-profile cases

like this one boosted morale. If Goreh, a Brahmin, were won in the north, in
the same period, the son of a rajah of Cochin in the south also converted.
Jacob Rama Varma (1814–56), as he would be known, was a Vaishnava,
who impressed his royal father by becoming, early in life, a fine scholar of
Sanskrit and the Puranas. During a course of study in English at a mission
school, however, he developed an interest in Christianity. His teacher was a
CMS missionary and both agreed that image worship was crude. From this
initial point of conjunction, Varma soon found himself listening to sermons.
A lucky escape from death convinced him of Christ’s power, and a little
later, when unwell, he vowed that if he survived, he would convert. And so,
in 1835, the rajah’s boy went Christian. [231] To Hindus, of course, such cases
were worrying: The jibe that people converted for money, to escape their


-----

232
inferior station or from other opportunistic motives did not explain highstatus converts. If, that is, men already possessed of social, cultural and
material capital _still_ opted to exit their parental faith, Christianity clearly
offered something meaningful. [233] Or worse, there was a gap in Hindu ideas
and a point of weakness. But high-caste harvests were not easy for
Protestants to accommodate either. While as late as 1870, a missionary
would speak of the ‘thrill’ of converting Brahmins, [234] this meant having to
look away from ingrained Hindu legacies. Many Brahmin converts, thus,
thought of themselves as _Brahmin_ Christians; conversion did not mean
throwing out ‘caste dignity’. [235] After all, as one scholar observes, just as
race did not miraculously vanish when the brown man joined the white
missionary’s church, so too caste could never recede by fiat. [236] Where
Catholics like de Nobili embraced this—transformed it into opportunity
even—modern evangelicals struggled. [237]

In 1841, the editor of _Bombay Gazette_ was compelled to resign. His crime
was simple: allowing outrageous Indian opinions to be aired in his
newspaper. It began innocuously, with the man inviting ‘natives’ to express
views on matters that would ‘benefit the Indian people’. One midtwenties critic, Bhaskar Pandurang (1816–47)—brother of the teacher [238]
Dadoba Pandurang, mentioned in the last chapter—took up the offer, and
from July-end to October, sent in eight letters. Signing them ‘A Hindoo’,
these are counted among the earliest critiques of British imperialism by an
Indian; indeed, in his very first letter, our ‘Hindoo’ hoped to ‘methodically’
make his case. [239] Conquest, he began, was a fact of history; he would not
begrudge the British that they had seized India by the rules of power. But
what then? Unless conquered people were invested in the new order,
resistance was natural. And yet, instead of conciliating Indians, ‘You keep
yourselves quite aloof’ and ‘conduct yourselves with such haughtiness and
pride as if you were quite a distinct and superior order of beings’. Racism,


-----

that is, would not do. India ‘gained nothing’ from British rule, Pandurang
added, the white man’s claims of bringing the land peace being ‘humbug’.
‘Natives’, for example, were asked to be grateful that the Company had
ended the predations of mercenary armies and dangerous tribes. And yet
‘your trading system’ had ‘more effectually emptied our purses in a few
years than the predatory excursions of these tribes could do in some five or
six hundred years’. [240] ‘You plunder us on all sides’, he went on, and
‘pompously’ point to ‘petty things’ like public infrastructure. Sure, the
British might not oppress like ‘Barbarians’, but this was because they didn’t
need to; ‘under the garb of law and justice’ they possessed fancier tools of
extraction. [241] Oppression was still the primary feature of empire, and no
quantity of gloss and sophistry could mask this.

Where religion was concerned, Pandurang believed things laughable. The

Mughals too sneered at Hinduism, but they did not push Hindus away from
office and respect. Besides, when someone converted, there were tangible
benefits. But what did the Company offer? ‘Can you point out a single
instance of a Native who has embraced’ Christianity and was subsequently
‘nominated to a high civil appointment’ or ‘treated on equal terms with his
white skined [sic] Brethren?’ [242] British dislike of sati was touching, and
certainly it was bad to burn widows, but expressions of ‘common humanity
vanish away in the mighty vortex of your _political_ cruelty’. [243] This was also
why good rajahs were pushed off their thrones, for the British had a shady
incentive in propping up the ‘weak and imbecil [sic]’ as exemplars of
‘native’ character. [244] To civilize ‘natives’ that is, those ‘natives’ would
constantly have to be projected as uncivilized. In any case, how was the
Indian character to improve? ‘You have taken away our money . . . made us
wholly dependent on your bounty’, filling the gap with unsolicited lectures
on morality. [245] Writers, with ‘the pomposity of words’ and a ‘show of
erudition’—a reference probably to Mill—urged Hindus to be grateful for
the empire, [246] but British rule was a ‘bitter curse’; government by a ‘race of
demons’. [247] As Christians, the Company might presume they would get
away with this, in the guarantee of ‘final beatitude thro’ the medium of your


-----

Saviour, Jesus Christ’. But it was fallacy: ‘How could you dare hope that all
your enormous crimes . . . will be pardoned in Heaven?’ In fact, the British
were mocking god. But then again, ‘the most treacherous are always the
most prosperous’. [248] Perhaps greed in the present was worth the risk of
eternal damnation. [249]

Pandurang’s criticism of Company rule, in fact, marks the context within

which the religious entanglements between Hindus and missionaries were
occurring. It was symptomatic of a new dynamic in India: the _political_ fight
between ‘native’ and colonizer. Talk of faith did not, that is, emerge in a
vacuum, and debates around it were merely an outlet for a veritable basket
of grievances. Evidence of this appears in interesting ways. In 1828, for
instance, a missionary found that in north Indian villages, at the annual
enactment of the Ramayana, the epic’s villains were dressed like the
governor general and Company troops. [250] So too, press records reveal
brown voices articulating resistance. Leupolt in Benares was alive to the
threat. Government, by permitting ‘natives’ Western education were, he
wrote, ‘nourishing vipers’. Indians were devouring texts to ‘expand their
minds, and fill their heads with knowledge’, not least of which was the
language of political rights. And given that these ideas were penetrating
‘native’ skulls without a simultaneous Christianization of the soul, it could
only have heinous consequences: ‘Indians [awakened] could in one night
destroy all the English throughout the length and breadth of the country.’ [251]

He was not wrong: Dandekar’s debates with Wilson, for example, were
cheered in the ‘native’ press. In 1823, _The Brahmunical Magazine_ warned
that if missionaries wished their religion to be viewed warmly, ‘you [too]
should not throw offensive reflections upon the religion of others’. [252] One
brown intellectual, in arguing for his countrymen to absorb modern
education, similarly asked: ‘Is it not owing to the power which knowledge
has given to the people of so small . . . a country as England’ that they could
seize India? ‘Why is it thought the most extravagant dream to suppose

[then] that _India_ should ever conquer England?’ [253] In the next year, as the
Company’s charter was up for renewal, the _Bombay Native Observer_


-----

similarly called for a ‘total’ renovation of British policy; in its extant form,
it ‘implanted sorrow, misery, and aversion’. Brown men, simply put, were
starting to speak up. [254]

While argued effectively—and sharply—the sentiments Pandurang

expressed in English for the benefit of an equally English audience were not
unprecedented, however. In fact, they had been building up. As early as
1809, when the _dewan_ (minister) of Travancore attempted to box the
Company out of Kerala, his proclamation to the people made matching
points. The British were welcomed as friends, but they betrayed that trust
with ‘ingratitude and treachery’. When terms of treaties no longer suited
them, he claimed, they revised it using craft and threats, until whole
kingdoms were extinguished. Warning that if given further room, they
would ‘put their own guards in the palaces’, ‘destroy the royal seal’,
‘suppress the Brahmanical communities’, impose ‘exorbitant’ taxes, ‘put up
crosses and Christian flags’ and do all that was ‘unjust and unlawful’, the
dewan appealed to Travancore’s people to fight. [255] His pitch, simply, was
that the Company threatened not just one or two isolated aspects of life but
an entire order. And the people responded—an inquiry after the revolt
revealed a ‘deep rooted’ hostility, and a desire for the ‘subversion of [the
Company’s] power’. [256] And this, in an area not even under direct British
rule—unlike Bengal, that is, this coastal state remained under a rajah, and
_yet_ , its people hated the Company. Indeed, the ‘most respectable men in the
Country, and the mass of the people’ had answered the dewan’s call from ‘a
sense of duty’. [257] But what is telling is the dewan’s use of the language of
justice. Just as British officials and missionaries enlisted moral jargon to
back their claims, Hindus here brought forth _their_ readings of principle to
attack the enemy. To this, of course, were added points of public interest,
such as taxes, but the glue binding them was emotion. And emotional union
—or at least a simulation of it—with Indians was the Company’s perennial
infirmity.

In the end, as is well known, the country saw widespread rebellion in

1857. The British would later infantilize ‘natives’ by dismissing the revolt
as provoked by the supply of cartridges greased with animal fat—of cows
and pigs—thereby upsetting Hindu and Muslim ‘prejudices’. Large parts of
the Bengal army mutinied, launching a year-long military resistance. [258]

Viewed this way, the rebellion was carnage by an irrational people lashing
out over a triviality. But the fact is that the cartridges were merely the match
that lit the fire; powder had been accumulating for years. It was feared, thus,
that the Company, via the cartridges, use of which entailed loss of caste,
was seeking to turn entire regiments Christian. [259] The increasingly visible
nexus between the state and missionaries gave credence to rumours. After


-----

all, could white men attack Indian religions in the streets without official
backing? [260] Indeed, evangelicals waved Christian texts at Hindu festivals,
including before men attending to the deities. [261] British love of beef also
soured things—by the mid-nineteenth century, an estimated 3,50,000 cows
were being slaughtered yearly in India to satiate the white man’s palate. [262]

So, once violence began, righteous judgement was reversed. When English
officers demanded the soldiers’ loyalty, the reply was: ‘You Banchats

[sister-fuckers]! have _you_ been faithful to the King of Oude [Awadh]?’,
whose lands had been seized. [263] Economic woes featured too: Every
annexation of Indian territory caused disruptions; each time the British
‘extinguished a court’, it ‘narrowed the areas of Indian employment’. [264]

Company soldiers were drawn, after all, from the rural mass that bore the
brunt of British policies. [265] Religion gave these grievances moral force, to
back which the rebels sought political legitimation from dispossessed
‘native’ icons, like the Mughal emperor. Indian ideology, frames of thinking
and ethnicity were summoned in resisting the Company, bringing together
everyone from Brahmins to the ‘untouchables’ and tribal groups. [266] And the
realization that ‘natives’ were capable of such a combination—even if
imperfectly—horrified India’s foreign masters. [267] The danger men like
Munro and Malcolm had warned about all those years ago, finally came to
pass. [268]

This is not to suggest that religion played a simply instrumental role. For

many, fear of their culture, way of life and identity being trampled on was
real. And faith was an expression of all that mattered. In Awadh, after its
annexation, one rumour announced that the Company was readying to send
a hundred missionaries to convert their freshly acquired subjects. [269] When
the rebellion failed, and a group of soldiers, on their way to execution, was
interrogated, they too said: ‘The slaughter of the English was required by
our religion.’ [270] Even those who did not join the mobilization gave it tacit
support: Company policemen remarked to one witness that though ordered
to challenge the rebels, they would not do so. ‘All black men are one,’ and it
was ‘a matter of religion’. [271] In the south, missionaries heard ‘[t]errifying


-----

rumours’ that the rebellion was against Christians, whose religion would be
‘exterminated’. [272] Faith became a means here to articulate a variety of
concerns. As the historian Rudrangshu Mukherjee writes, religion was ‘the
source of solidarity and fraternity . . . something that was imbricated with
their entire life’, informing the ordinary peasant-soldier’s view of the
world. [273] A proclamation issued by a Mughal prince reflects this.
Identifying the common threat—the Company and Christianity—it cast
Hindus and Muslims both as defending the correct way of things. Noting
the Company’s tax policies, the exclusion of Indians from ‘posts of dignity’,
the destruction of Indian industry and so on, the document presented 1857
not as a rebellion but a ‘holy war’. [274] In fact, after the collapse of the
resistance, when Queen Victoria issued her well-known proclamation of
1858, declaring the end of Company rule for direct government by the
British crown, she guaranteed religious non-interference. But even then, a
rebel leader declared:

In the Proclamation it is written, that the Christian religion is true, but no other creed will
suffer oppression, and that the laws will be observed towards all. What has the
administration of justice to do with the truth or falsehood of a religion? That religion is
true which acknowledges one God . . .Where there are three Gods in a religion

[Christianity], neither Mussulmans nor Hindoos—nay, not even Jews, Sun-worshippers,
or Fire-worshippers can believe it true. To eat pigs and drink wine, to bite greased
cartridges . . . to destroy Hindoo and Mussulman temples on pretence of making roads, to
build churches, to send clergymen into the streets . . . to institute English schools . . .
while the places of worship of Hindoos and Mussulmans are . . . entirely neglected; with
all this, how can the people believe that religion will not be interfered with? The rebellion
began with religion, and for it, millions of men have been killed. Let not our subjects be
deceived; thousands were deprived of their religion . . . and thousands [preferred to be]

hanged rather than abandon their religion. [275]

Hindus and Muslims were one in this—they had been wronged. And the
villain of the piece, of course, was the white man. The Company had
conquered and betrayed; it had violated treaties and the spirit of justice; it
had toppled ‘native’ founts of authority, while failing to fit the mould and,
finally, by allowing missionaries and their cultural project to intrude into
India, they had attacked a powerful element of the Indian identity. A leading


-----

evangelical had, a few decades before, glibly remarked that no concerted
anti-British effort was possible in India, for ‘Hindoos resemble an immense
number of particles of sand, which are incapable of forming a solid mass.
There is no bond of union among them, nor any principle capable of
effecting it.’ [276] And yet, less than fifty years later, the British empire
received its worst, most threatening paroxysm. The Great Rebellion was
chaotic, fragmented and had its internal dissonances and problems. Yet,
even in the _attempt_ to give it an overarching goal, there was danger. Or as
verses composed in one rebel leader’s camp showed, the emerging Indian
sentiment was clear:

It is the holy country of the people dearer to heaven.

This is in our ownership and Hi[n]dustan is ours.
The Firangis [British] coming from distant land[s] used deceit;

Plundered our dear country with both hands.
Today the martyrs have called upon you, o countrymen:

Break the chain of slavery and rain fire.
Hindu, Muslim and Sikh are our brothers.

This is the flag of freedom to which we salute. [277]

But jolted as the British officialdom were, what impact did events of that
blood-soaked year have on missionaries? Evidently nothing that inspired
circumspection. Many, in fact, remained steadfast in their convictions, even


-----

identifying god’s hand in the floundering of the revolt. Or as was declared
at a meeting in southern India in 1858, if anything, it was now time to
double down and bring yet more pressure on government to promote the
Christian cause. ‘The system hitherto,’ its official statement announced,
without any hint of irony, ‘has been deference to idolatry and indifference
to Christianity. We plead for a reversal of this system.’ [278]

And so, the battle—inaugurated in the age of Charles Grant—raged on,

unresolved. [279] As for the Hindus, a sense of crisis was clear, to resolve
which, answers would need to be found.

 ‘NATIVE LUTHERS’

_Dessins_ (1827).


-----

In the town of Bhagalpur, Bihar, in January 1809 an Englishman had a
quarrel with a ‘native’ of standing. The Company’s district collector was
waiting ‘among some bricks’ by the roadside when the Indian passed that
way in a palanquin. Provoked that the brown man did not descend and do
him salaam, Frederick Hamilton used an ‘epithet of abuse’, spewing
expletives even as a servant in the Indian’s retinue vouched that his master
simply did not see him. Hamilton was not placated. Mounting his horse, he
chased after the palanquin, getting its occupant to climb out and prostrate
himself. His ‘indecorous’ verbal emissions did not cease, though, providing
a background score to these happenings. Soon, the whole town heard of the
Indian’s ‘public indignity’. Complaining later to the governor general about
the ‘degradation’ that resulted, the latter asked if this were the standard
‘natives’ should expect from the British. Sure, in the age of the Mughals,
men were expected to grovel to show ‘external respect’ to their superiors.
But was not the Company ‘milder’ than the regime they replaced? Did they
not claim to have introduced an ‘enlightened and more liberal policy’ as
rulers? [1] The appeal worked: Hamilton was rebuked, despite influence in the
British establishment, and told to learn to behave. As for the ‘native’, he
had won a small but significant triumph, of both principle and self-respect.

The man in the palanquin—Ram Mohun Roy—would go on to become

one of the most striking Indians of the century. Born in the 1770s, [2] he
belonged to a house of Brahmins who swapped religious and philosophical
pursuits for worldly prosperity through bureaucratic service. On his paternal
side, his ancestors had served the Mughal state and their _nawabi_
representatives, mastering Persian and Arabic in the process—languages
Roy also learnt. His mother’s family, however, remained wardens of faith,
officiating as priests to the goddess Kali. And so, chiefly through maternal
influence, it is believed, Roy absorbed Sanskrit and explored the Brahmins’
sacred texts also. Added with his own later study of English, this polymath
quality would allow the Bengali to cultivate not only erudition but also a
new vision for Hindu society. Besides, he was rich. By his late twenties,
aided by an inheritance, Roy was a moneylender, whose debtors included
Company officials. In his forties, he owned several homes in Calcutta, not


-----

to speak of estates that turned in handsome rents. He also worked with more
than one civil servant—and so well that one of them continued to engage
him despite orders not to do so. [3] And to crown it all, towards the end of his
life, he would be granted the title ‘rajah’ by the Mughal padshah, as whose
envoy Roy sailed to Britain, bedazzling a fresh cast of persons. [4]

Given his antecedents, talent and social standing, one can see why Roy

felt confident enough to demand action against his maltreatment by
Hamilton. In fact, he was used to standing up for himself. He would later
recall that already in his teens, he was asking difficult questions of his
family on custom and faith. [5] From the opening years of the nineteenth
century, Roy’s scholarly inquiries would steadily upset everyone—from
Muslim clerics, missionaries of the BMS, orthodox Hindus to even his
mother (who, in her vehemence, instigated a grandson to sue him for half
his property). [6] But while he occasionally needed bodyguards, his
convictions won the man respect among intellectuals (including orientalists
like H.H. Wilson) and young ‘natives’. By the time of his death, in 1833, he
would be known even in America; he became, we read, ‘the first global
Indian’. [7] When Roy arrived in Britain in 1831—statuesque, turbaned and in
Mughal robes—crowds gathered to peer at him, resulting in ‘police
intervention’ in at least one town. In London, even as the exactions of
fashionable society left Roy physically depleted, he became likely the first
Indian to sit in the royal pavilion with the British monarch. [8] The press,
besides, was transfixed; soon, newspapers circulated talk of a romantic
entanglement with an Englishwoman. Some also believed the Brahmin had
fathered a child in Bristol. [9]

But a supposed mixed-race family aside, what is more fascinating is

Roy’s intellectual journey. He belonged, on the one hand, to a class of
Anglophone Indians who did not view British rule as a disaster. When
younger, Roy claimed, he felt ‘aversion’ to the Company, but mature
reflection convinced him that British authority would aid the ‘amelioration
of the natives’; the ‘foreign yoke’ could translate into an instrument for
regeneration. [10] On the other hand, he worked to also defend Hinduism from


-----

missionaries. This was not, however, the furious stance of other antievangelical figures. Unlike many of them, Roy admitted that there was
indeed much in Hinduism that was woeful, and sati, as with foreign critics,
topped his list. He judged religion by an ethical yardstick: All that passed
his test was welcome; what did not, had to be excreted. [11] And, sati, a
‘barbarous and inhuman practice’, this husband of two wrote, failed here; it
was simply glorified murder. [12] Over time, Roy also creatively reinterpreted
scripture, constructing a Hindu rhetoric for reform, while calling out
missionary hypocrisy. Indeed, when white men hit Hindus with the charge
of idolatry, Roy accepted it but also returned the favour by highlighting
corruptions in the Christian religion. [13] Orientalists lamented Hinduism’s
decline from ancient glory; Roy sniffed about Christianity’s loss of original
purity. [14] He was also more than capable of delivering the occasional punch:
Encountering racist nonsense about ‘Asiatic effeminacy’ once, he reminded
his interlocutors that Jesus was an ‘Asiatic’. [15]

But Roy was not in the business of pitting one faith against the other; all

religions, he seemed to suggest, suffered from insincere custodians. To him,
religion was not to be conceived of as a defence of dogma but as a
celebration of ethical conduct; and to do this, mankind needed no
intermediaries. These ideas first appeared in 1803–04 in his Persian
exposition, the _Tuhfat-ul-Muwahhidin_ . [16] Around the world, Roy observed,
humans acknowledged ‘One Eternal Being’; and god, in turn, subjected all
of humanity to the same rules, emotions, physical limits, joys and so on. If
then, rival religious traditions claimed to better represent god or exclusively
offer means to serve him, they were only peddling man-made inventions;
_institutionalized_ faith had no divine authority. The proof lay in how
religious regulations were so divergent. For instance, Brahmins claimed
god’s authority to use idols; Muslims denied idols, insisting _this_ was god’s
real wish. ‘Now,’ asked Roy, ‘are these contradictory precepts . . . consistent
with the wisdom and mercy of the . . . disinterested Creator’, or were they
purely ‘fabrications’ by mortals? God only made uniform laws; it was men
who ‘invent[ed] doctrines’ that fostered ‘disunion’. It did not matter if the


-----

parties in question were Hindus or non-Hindus: They were governed, Roy
held, by worldly prejudices. And unlike him, most of society was too ‘blind
and deaf’ to admit this. [17] It seemed a radical take on the idea of religion
itself; so radical, in fact, that Roy himself appears to have softened his tone
somewhat in future. [18]

Even so, the _Tuhfat_ is surprisingly aligned with European Enlightenment

thought. [19] Some have tried to demarcate a Western intellectual genealogy
for its ideas—surely, Roy knew at least fragments of Enlightenment
philosophy to express something so tantalizingly similar? But the fact
remains that at this stage, his exposure to European writing and English was
limited; what is more probable is that these ideas emerged from his
Persianate education. [20] Besides, India’s bhakti saints from the early-modern
period, like Kabir and Nanak, also articulated similar ideas: Their teachings
may well have influenced Roy. [21] But if in the _Tuhfat_ he also targeted Islam
—and possibly got into trouble [22] —its basic tenets would inform his
approach chiefly to Christianity and Hinduism. The existence of these rival
religions, in and of itself, does not appear to have caused Roy grief: They
were, he believed, the functional product of geography, cultural peculiarities
and historical dynamics. But for this reason precisely, they could not be
unnaturally forced into other regions. [23] As for core precepts, these were
ultimately the same, drawing from natural laws and guided by reason. This
had two results: Missionaries found fault with Roy for denying Christianity
its universal ambitions, while Hindu conservatives resented his questioning
entrenched ‘native’ customs. They saw, for instance, the 1829 British ban
on sati as an assault on Hinduism; Roy, however, not only invited state
intervention but also energetically campaigned against sati. Because, to
him, this was not Hinduism: God did not ask to burn women. Men did. [24]

And like Protestant minds that advocated a return to ‘pure’ scripture and its
uncontaminated ideas, Roy would—from within Hindu society—seek to set
off a Reformation of sorts. This was, in his mind, the only way Hindus
could navigate modernity.


-----

Roy’s reform agenda for Hinduism began in the mid-1810s, through a set

of tracts in Bengali (later translated into English)—a very missionary
technique, making full use of the power of the printing press. [25] The choice
of language is telling: Unlike Persian, which catered to elites, Roy hoped
Bengali would filter downwards. In fact, he printed hundreds of copies of
his writings at his own expense and had them freely distributed in the hope
of reaching as wide a readership as possible. [26] He was not, that is,
appealing to Brahmins and intellectuals only but a larger audience—a
successful strategy that helped centre his ideas in reframing Hinduism more
generally in the nineteenth century. Here, however, European influences are
visible in the form of prevailing orientalist wisdom that ‘true’ Hinduism
could be located only in its ancient, authentic Sanskrit texts. And that all
customs not ‘imperatively enjoined’ by such sources were open to reform. [27]

This is clear from the fact that where his 1803–04 _Tuhfat_ came from a time
when Roy had minimal interaction with Europeans, by now, a decade later,
he was in fluent contact with orientalists and missionaries. [28] So a textualist
attitude towards religion, preferred by dominant outsiders—and in line with
his Brahmin roots—sat easily with Roy. And through him and his
successors, it would slowly become natural for many other Hindus also.
Just as evangelicals in Britain nurtured a ‘religious public’, that is,
reformers like Roy were cultivating one in India: a class that in time would
also glaze their Hindu identity with nationalism. [29]

To start with, Roy argued that the reigning brand of Hinduism was a

travesty: a view that was manifestly growing among a set of Indians, given
that an English-speaking Brahmin from the south aired similar thoughts in
the same period. [30] And so, Roy wrote in 1816, his endeavour was ‘to
convince my countrymen of the true meaning of our sacred books’, while
proving in tandem to British appraisers that ‘superstitious practices which
deform’ living Hinduism were inconsistent with its ‘spirit’. [31] The goal,
then, was twofold: to teach Hindus that their religion, _as it existed_ , was not
actually their religion; and to persuade Europeans—as exemplified by
James Mill and William Ward, whose notorious works appeared in the same


-----

years—that they had misjudged Hinduism. This was, patently, a top-down
reading of faith: a marriage of a Western conception of what any religion
ought to look like (such as the emphasis on scripture) with the slant of a
Brahmin synthesizing European and ‘native’ ideas. [32] Except that in this
case, what was a fluid system, which in its ability to absorb all manner of
cults and beliefs had plural origins, hastened its move towards
regimentation, with a one-source pedigree—and this time not in writings by
foreigners. It was not, to be clear, the ‘invention’ of a new faith. For
‘communities constantly renew themselves . . . and creative individuals can
. . . make a critical contribution’. [33] The process, besides, was afoot ever
since Hindus encountered Islam. But for all that, Hinduism had stayed an
amorphous system, until colonialism and evangelical perils inspired some
Hindus to espouse a firmer outline. Modern Hinduism was not, then, as
some argue, a synthetic British construct. It was nevertheless a fresh
incarnation, necessitated by political and social crises—somewhat like
Vishnu assuming different forms to address problems in various ages.

Indeed, reformers could find justification for Hinduism’s rebranding

_within_ the Hindu tradition; as we saw in the Introduction, this was a
constantly transforming, responsive universe. Or in the words of a later
writer, ‘As knowledge grows, our theology develops.’ [34] So, even if the
terms were set by foreigners, sufficiently ‘native’ roots could be located for
adopting and indigenizing those very terms. The Sanskrit corpus, as we
know, is capacious enough that, with a bit of flexibility, evidence for
everything might be discovered in it. [35] Roy knew this: In his tracts, he cited
Vedic verses to set Hinduism in its new frame—as a uniform, nonidolatrous monotheism. Belief in the ‘unity of God [was the] real
Hindooism’ of ‘our ancestors’, he would assert—a line that also lumped
together all Hindus everywhere as one ‘us’, descended from a single set of
spiritual progenitors. [36] Doing so, however, involved a bias in curation: The
quotations Roy chose, thus, were not from the oldest part of the Vedas.
Those, with hymns to many deities, rubbed against his goal of a rational
Hinduism. (In fact, in London, seeing a scholar study these, he told him not


-----

to ‘waste his time’. [37] ) What Roy preferred was the Upanishads—
philosophical ruminations, themselves diverse, and which had received
orientalist praise [38] —from which he harvested lines to manufacture a tidy
profile for Hinduism. Of course, he made errors and his knowledge of the
Vedas was incomplete. But few could tell. [39] Bengal had hardly any Vedic
experts, and it took a Tamil Brahmin to spot flaws in Roy’s postulations. [40]

And in any case, this selective reading of scripture—embracing some bits,
excising others—was never just a spiritual matter; it was political. Or as
Roy acknowledged, ‘[T]he present system of [Hindus’] religion’ was not
‘well calculated to promote their political interest’; so, ‘some change’ was
imperative. [41] And given that few showed any urgency, he had personified
himself as a torchbearer for renovation. It is also not, therefore, a minor
detail that Roy was perhaps the first Hindu to appropriate ‘Hinduism’ as a
term and label in his writings. And by this he meant his own version of it. [42]

Ironically, this was the missionary method too: to pick and choose

whatever pushed pet ideas, though in their case, it was to excoriate
Hinduism. But more directly, Roy, like Protestants, placed scripture over
‘custom and accumulated tradition’. Even his Bengali versions of Vedic
extracts, which in translation were infused with his own messaging,
mirrored Protestant efforts to vernacularize the Bible. [43] So also, having
accepted the premise of Hinduism’s decline from unparalleled purity, Roy
had to explain how this happened. And here, he parked blame with
Brahmins—another missionary theme, directly descended from the
Protestant battering of Catholic ‘priestcraft’ in Europe. [44] For instance, just
as Francis Xavier, the sixteenth-century Jesuit, accused Brahmins of veiling
monotheism from the masses, Roy argued that Hinduism’s loftiest ideas,
‘concealed within the dark curtain of the Sungscrit language’, never reached
its beneficiaries thanks to Brahmin cunning. [45] Where Xavier charged this
class with exploiting gullible ‘natives’ for gifts, Roy too declared that
Brahmins pushed the ‘absurdity of idolatry’ for selfish ‘comforts and
fortune’, hiding what really mattered: ‘knowledge of their scriptures’. [46]

And finally, he attacked Puranic Hinduism and its gods, in a tone


-----

reminiscent of James Mill and missionary pamphlets. Krishna, he declared,
committed unholy acts with women; Siva’s (phallic) icon was so ‘indecent’,
it was ‘impossible’ to describe ‘in language fit to meet the public eye’; Kali
was singularly unladylike, with her taste for ‘wine, criminal intercourse,
and licentious songs’. [47] Declaring himself ‘unwilling to stain’ his pages
with more ‘stories of immorality’, Roy prayed: ‘May God speedily purify
the minds of my countrymen from the corruptness’ which enslaved them,
and ‘lead their hearts to that pure morality’ of (designated parts of) the
Vedas. [48]

Roy was clear on what his religion was not. But what _was_ ‘pure’,

distilled Hinduism? The Upanishads, he announced, saw ‘polytheism with
contempt’. [49] Given, however, that he could not ignore the many Vedic
deities, Roy added that idolatry was _tolerated_ as a ‘last provision for those .
. . incapable of raising their minds’. Sadly, the ‘generality of the Hindoo
community’ existed in ‘defiance of their sacred books’, in this infantile
state. [50] As we have noted before, it would have startled most Hindus to find
that they must tailor religious life according to texts; that they must dismiss
gods in temples as so many rocks. And yet the legitimacy Roy’s ideas
gained suggests that enough Hindus did welcome his interpretation. [51] In
other words, he was filling a genuinely felt gap; Hinduism’s extant avatar
opened it to attack, and as national feelings grew, room for such criticism
had to be eliminated. Besides, much of what Roy said was familiar. ‘The
greater religious systems of Hinduism,’ after all, were ‘always . . .
accompanied by individuals or groups who challenged them.’ [52] The
perception of image worship as a subordinate practice came from the ninthcentury philosopher, Sankara; Roy’s anti-idol stance was anticipated 600
years before in the south by Basava; Brahminical ritualism, which Roy
disparaged, was attacked in western India as far back as the fourteenth
century by thinkers like Namdev. [53] Even his critics did not squirm at the
idea of a single supreme being, for they too recognized it; what they denied
was Roy’s view that Puranic Hinduism—with its temples, gods and myths
—was false; that one could slice Hinduism into religious ideas (good) and


-----

religious practice (bad). [54] So, despite innovation, there was much that
would have been recognizable to Hindus in Roy’s hybrid vision. That is,
even if the brackets within which Hinduism was being placed betrayed
Protestant influences, the paternity of the substance inside seemed
justifiably Indian. [55]

And yet, there was a difference from older intellectual stances. While

India had never faced a deficit of ideas, these were often scattered. They
had rarely been lined up so neatly, with single-minded purpose. After all,
earlier philosophers, even as they planted in the Indian mind notions fitting
Roy’s project, also upheld elements that sat poorly with him. Basava
lampooned idolatry but challenged claims of Vedic supremacy too: Roy’s
veneration of the Upanishads would not have appealed to this medieval
forebear. Namdev and the bhakti poets believed in a devotional culture,
often focused on a humanized god, not just divinity in the abstract—this too
would have made Roy fret. [56] Sankara’s prescriptions on finding the
formless god were for the ‘ascetic and [Brahmin] intellectual’, while our
nineteenth-century man urged it on Hindus in toto; here again was
dissonance. [57] So even if these ideas had swirled about, it was the
combination of colonialism, modernity and the Christian threat that helped
chisel them into a uniform, formal Hinduism. Similarly, while those earlier
figures mattered, it is open to debate if they ever saw themselves as
‘reformers’. [58] This is also why Roy’s work seems such a direct corollary to
the missionary project. White men berated Hindus and advertised their faith
as purer; Roy modified this to sell Hindus not Christianity but a deepcleansed, scripturalist Hinduism that could withstand Western censure.
Evangelicals dreamt of transforming brown men through the Bible; Roy
intended to do the same, but with Vedic passages. [59] Both thought Hindus
deluded and competed, with proportionate condescension, to ‘save’ them.
And yet Roy’s political genius lay in erecting a serious obstacle in the
missionary’s path: a new ‘ancient’ Hindu alternative to Christianity, which
rendered conversion theoretically—as well as theologically—redundant. [60]


-----

This did tragically, however, circumscribe what it meant to be Hindu.

Hinduism historically featured jostling, exchange and a good deal of
negotiation, with Brahmins subsuming all kinds of practices. While this had
its politics and was hardly neat, even in the nineteenth century, Hindus lived
a fascinatingly rich life, with ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ aspects entwined. A
memoir by a Deccan writer, born just before Roy’s death, captures this
reality. The man came of the Kasar caste of smiths. His prosperous family
lived in a Brahmin area and viewed vegetarianism as ritually purer; yet they
continued to eat meat, speaking in code of fish as ‘water beans’, mutton as
‘red vegetables’. They bowed at Brahmin-led temples, but Brahmins
likewise participated in their goddess rites featuring flesh and liquor;
vegetarian values evaporated at such moments. The writer’s father
diligently read the (Marathi-language) Gita, and through it engaged with
Hindu philosophy; meanwhile, an uncle paid visits to the shrine of a
Muslim sufi. The women of the household prayed to serpents but also made
vows on Muharram; and in general, the family engaged as much with the
so-called inferior gods and shepherd priests as with Brahminical rites. ‘My
life,’ the author concluded, ‘was marked by the grossest inconsistencies’
and ‘contradictory doctrines’—inconsistent, that is, from the new
viewpoint. [61] But that was precisely it: To Hindus, variety had been normal;
their religious world was, as one scholar put it, like a Venn diagram of
overlapping experiences. [62] This was not proof of decay, as missionaries,
orientalists and Roy believed, but an organic reflection of history. [63] By the
nineteenth century, however, new norms prevailed, demanding consistency.
But in what might have vexed Roy, our kasar memoirist, instead of
pledging himself to reformed Hinduism, hopped the fence to Christianity.

Roy’s final years were spent away from home, in Britain, where he

became a star. Meanwhile in India, the ideas he voiced would gain a robust
intellectual life. [64] But if he was described as a ‘native’ Martin Luther, Roy
never achieved Luther’s practical success. His followers gathered in a group
called the Brahmo Samaj, which upheld the ‘Eternal Unsearchable and
Immutable Being’ and pledged itself against ‘graven image[s]’. [65] This was,


-----

however, too unemotional a faith to persuade more than a few; instead,
Brahmoism stayed a tiny sect, while worship of Siva, Kali and Vishnu
continued predominant. [66] Indeed, Roy was unable to convince his mother
even: While he forsook Puranic Hinduism, the lady defiantly clung on,
spending her last days serving Jagannath at Puri. [67] Where Roy endured,
then, was in identifying a formula to ennoble Hinduism in modern, Western
eyes—the English-speaking intelligentsia especially found his Upanishadsbased framing attractive. Moreover, he blunted the Christian threat to
Hinduism. Between 1820 and 1823, Roy published much on Christianity,
reiterating his stance from the _Tuhfat_ . Jesus’s moral teachings, he
pronounced, deserved praise; all beyond that, such as miracles, was
nonsense. (Besides, Roy warned, Hindus had a stockpile of these: Christ’s
walk on water paled next to Agastya, who drank an ocean, only to restore it
via the bladder.) [68] Missionaries retorted by arguing—like Roy’s Hindu
critics—that he could not coolly delink ethical precepts from the remainder
of a religious package. The real fear, though, went beyond this: for by
subjecting Christian scripture to analysis, to sustained interrogation by
reason, and interpreting it on _his_ terms, this brown man reversed what
Europeans did to ‘native’ religious literature. [69] Roy’s strategy, that is,
allowed Hinduism to hold its own in a changed, unequal world—and in key
respects, to turn the tables. [70]

In fact, Roy’s lowering of Christ as just another spiritual guru like

Confucius in China, [71] would help claim not equality but superiority for
Hinduism: for _this_ faith was not dependent on human mediation. [72] So too,
unlike Christianity, which, visualizing god, ascribes human features to him,
the Upanishads’ transcendent divinity rose above petty conceptions. And
this confirmed that Hindus owned the rational truth. [73] The very stick with
which missionaries beat ‘native’ religions was pointed the other way; to
good Hindus, _Christianity_ looked ‘Heathenish’, and to convert from the
Puranic religion to the cult of Christ was tantamount to replacing ‘one set of
polytheistical sentiments’ with another. [74] In time, this would popularize a
boilerplate argument that is recycled even now: that the West might surpass


-----

India materially, but in spiritual affairs, India rules. [75] As for Hinduism’s
contemporary degradation, it was irrelevant: All nations had ‘the ignorant
and the enlightened’; it was the latter who embodied their culture’s
values. [76] Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, a late-nineteenth-century writer, thus,
admitted ‘the duty of every Hindu, actively to assail’ the ‘absurdities’ which
‘subvert[ed]’ Hinduism. [77] But criticism from white men was laughable.
After all, if a Hindu travelled to Europe, he too might see in the Catholic
veneration of saints a polytheism—by standards applied in India, this
should prompt him to at once declare Christianity idolatrous. [78] No, what
mattered was principles. And here, even if the Hindus erred, Hindu _ism_ was
good. To argue otherwise was risky: for Christianity too must then bear
responsibility for ‘all the wars, all the massacres, all the murders that have
been committed in its name’. [79] Yet again, then, the colonizer was shown his
drawbacks, in a mirror of his own making—now seized on by ‘natives’. [80]

That said, Chatterjee—whose _Bande Mataram_ (1882), banned by the

colonial state, later became India’s national song and slogan—would
journey a step further than Roy. For, even while confirming his belief in a
paramount divinity, he questioned the near-totalitarian obsession with
monotheism:

. . . what is the high ground which monotheism is believed to occupy . . .? Why is a pure
monotheism . . . a rational worship, and polytheism mere stupidity . . . What evidence is
there, that God is One and cannot be many? That the government of the Universe unlike
that of society, is carried on by a single Personal Being . . . If you come to the question of
evidence . . . there is probably as little in favour of monotheism as of polytheism . . . You
may point to the unity of design apparent in nature, as indicative of a single Designer . . .
Will you infer from the unity of design apparent in a building that it was the work of a

sole architect, who had no masons or labourers to co-operate with him? [81]

That is, the Western frame itself was flawed—and, Chatterjee seemed to
suggest, Indians would do better to free themselves from operating within
its limits. Today, we might describe this as intellectual decolonization; a
smashing of that mirror. But back then, the writer was evidently ahead of
his time. For in the nineteenth century, many Hindus continued to give
purchase to the colonizer’s perception of the world. And so, Roy’s strategy
lived on, growing powerful: an aspect that might have provided him a sense
of achievement. As it happens, however, the postscript to the Bengali’s tale
is more amusing. A few years after he died, Roy’s body was exhumed and
reinterred in a cemetery in Bristol. Except that here, his well-wishers
deposited him under a canopy designed to look like an Indian temple. In
other words, Roy—the Brahmin laid to rest in Christian soil; the ‘native’


-----

who had railed against idolatry—became, in death, enshrined like a Hindu
deity. [82]

Somewhere around 1840, a teenager in Kathiawar, in western India, had a
crisis of faith. The son of a Brahmin revenue collector and banker, he was
raised in good comfort, much like Roy. Unlike the Bengali reformer,
though, this young man had no knowledge of English—he studied Sanskrit
texts and his vernacular tongue and was slowly being introduced also to the
ritual prescriptions for men of his caste. One night during Sivaratri—the
annual festival to Siva—our protagonist was asked to join a ceremonial
vigil at the local temple. No one was supposed to sleep, and with his father
being quite rigid about religious rites, he expected very much to have to
stick both to the letter and spirit of the proceedings. Except, however, that
within hours, daddy dozed right off. The teenager decided to do better,
perhaps due to the vigour and determination of the young. Except that his
reward was not magnified devotion but doubt. For at one point ‘in the
middle of the night’, a mouse appeared and ‘began to take liberties’ with the
mighty Lord of Destruction. The image of Siva showed him astride his bull,
Nandi, trident in hand; and yet, the deity seemed powerless as the mouse
‘ate away all the offerings that lay piled before’ him. This, it is said, shook
the watching Brahmin boy: What was the point of venerating a god who
seemed helpless before a trespassing rodent? Was Siva even present in the
idol or was this a ‘piece of clay’? [83] In any case, as dawn approached, the
teenager found himself in distress—his faith had suffered a crack, right
down the middle. [84]

It is possible the story of the mouse is a bit of gloss in the official

narrative around Dayananda Saraswati (1824–83), but it is meant to reflect
the early seeding of scepticism in him—and the belief that temple-based
Hinduism was inadequate. As such, the experience was not unique: The son
of the Cochin rajah too, mentioned in the previous chapter, was triggered
when a priest absconded with a family deity’s jewels—surely, god could not
have been present in the shrine, if his goods were so easily purloined? [85] In


-----

that case, though, the boy moved to Christianity, assuming the name Jacob;
his younger contemporary in Kathiawar, on the other hand, became a
reformer within Hinduism—yet another ‘Luther of India’. [86] Of course, the
transition was not instant, taking years after that late-night epiphany.
Dayananda, the story goes, yearned for answers, and began to study under a
guru. But then his family, fearing his increasing disinterest in worldly
matters, ambushed him with an antidote: a woman. Frustratingly, the trick
failed, and Dayananda, aged twenty-two, took drastic steps: The night
before his wedding, he ran away. Whatever possessions he carried with him
were stolen (by a band of mendicants, as it happened, who argued he had no
need of earthly possessions in a spiritual quest). His father, at one point,
even tracked him down and gave him a thrashing. But Dayananda fled a
second time—now with success. He would never see his kin again; and by
the time he returned to Kathiawar as a famous man, bonds of blood had
entirely dissolved. He was a renunciant, and to this day, the identity of his
family remains unsettled. [87]

Dayananda’s life arc could not be more different from Roy’s. Where the

Bengali moved easily in urban and colonial spaces, our wandering Brahmin
from the other side of India was a more traditional Hindu ascetic: a
sanyasi. [88] Unlike Roy, who preferred to appear in rich robes, for decades
Dayananda wore a loincloth; only in the 1870s, on the advice of Roy’s
intellectual heirs in Calcutta, did he give up this state of déshabillé to make
himself presentable to cosmopolitan audiences. [89] So too where Roy’s
intellectual evolution had a genteel quality, Dayananda’s was rough and
uneasy, featuring all kinds of unhappy experiments with beef-eating pandits
and grand but disappointing monks. [90] Both travelled: The Bengali, in
service of the Company, went as far as Bhutan up north and Madras in the
peninsula; the Kathiawari, meanwhile, roamed barefoot through western
and upper India, doing yoga in its jungles, and climbing Himalayan slopes
in search of fabled, mountain-dwelling ascetics. [91] Roy read a fair deal about
Western science; Dayananda learnt from cutting experience. Once, for
example, as he walked by a river, he found a corpse afloat. Pulling it ashore,


-----

Dayananda opened up the cadaver. ‘I . . . examined the heart and compared
it with descriptions in the [Sanskrit] books. I did the same with the head and
the neck.’ Sadly, he reports, ‘there was not the slightest similarity between
the text and the corpse’. The episode shattered all vestiges of unquestioning
faith in received knowledge. When Dayananda resumed his journey, the
books were bobbing alongside the mangled body. [92]

All along, though, the would-be hermit was hungry for spiritual answers.

He consumed tantric texts only to dismiss them as ‘disgusting literature’,
with ‘obscenities’, the worship of ‘indecent images’ and rites featuring
‘liquors, fish, and all kinds of animal food’. [93] Ironically, he himself grew
addicted to bhang—a cannabis-based drink—which, by his own admission,
took time to shake off; the initial hope was that transportation into a
different plane might aid his quest. [94] Idolatry he was already against, and
his travels confirmed his view that Hindus in general were attached to outer
forms as opposed to inner substance. Even ascetics let him down, some
with their performative quirks: One, for example, had loud conferences
with unknown beings in the dead of the night. [95] Finally, after a decade and
a half of wandering, during which time he learnt what he could, where he
could, Dayananda found a guru. In Mathura, a temple-town linked to the
deity Krishna, there lived a blind sanyasi who hated idol worship. [96] Even
as, all around him, pilgrims adored images of the romantic, cowherd god,
this man promoted a more austere Vedic religion. When they met, the story
goes, the guru asked Dayananda to head down to the river and first eject ‘all
the nonsense’ he had learnt in his thirty-six years. [97] Then began the
teaching, and at a standard, we read, that surpassed lessons even the
philosopher Sankara received a thousand years ago, from _his_ guru. [98] In fact,
the old man played a central role in turning Dayananda away from a
personal quest for answers, into a preacher addressing the world. [99] And
after some years, when the disciple was ready, the blind elder outlined his
mission: to ‘devote everything’ to propagating ‘the Vedic religion’. [100] To
become what admirers—in a rather missionary tone—described as a
‘soldier of Light’, ready ‘to fight untruth and the false gods’. [101]


-----

This narrative neatly accounts for Dayananda’s espousal of a Hinduism

anchored in the Vedas, and there is no reason to disbelieve it. But what is
interesting is that this view emerged not from any direct exposure to the
British or familiarity with orientalist scholarship; it came from a deep and
genuine disillusionment with the world as it was, and Puranic Hinduism’s
inadequacy to supply solutions. This is linked to a larger phenomenon: that
‘traditional’ Hinduism too was a dynamic space, not a frozen monolith; it
had figures within clamouring for change, even if they did not transact in
English. Thus, for example, contemporary to Dayananda, was the Tamil
Saiva saint Ramalinga (1823–74). He was not concerned with a uniform,
purified Hinduism; instead, his focus was modernising Saivism. In this, he
borrowed from past Saiva figures, composing, for example, erotic
devotional poetry to Siva (a big no-no for anglicized Hindus). [102] So also, he
challenged established Saiva institutions and endorsed a more accessible
faith, not in a Western jargon but using Indian precedents and concepts. For
him, Tamil, the common man’s tongue, was preferable to elite Sanskrit.
Indeed, he even invented new forms of temple ceremony, thus countering
the idea that ritual and tradition are unchanging. To be clear, there were, of
course, Roy-like Saiva reformers too, deploying Protestant techniques and
who internalized a ‘textual fundamentalism’; [103] Ramalinga, on the other
hand, worked with a different set of instruments. Unburdened by the
obsession with looking ‘rational’, this meant he could even make claims of
direct revelation from Siva and of miracles: anathema to reformers of the
Westernized variety. But for all that, Ramalinga’s work was also reform—
born, though, with little foreign stimulus. [104]

So also, in Orissa, there emerged the Mahima Dharma, described by the

end of the nineteenth century as a cult of ‘Hindu dissenters’. Its founder,
Mahima Swami, first arrived in the region in the 1820s but became a
prominent teacher only three-and-a-half decades later. Supported by two
others, including a poet, he travelled across the region, winning followers
among tribes and low-caste groups—sections disenfranchised by prevailing
Brahminical high culture. Over time, the movement spread not just in
Orissa but also into Bengal in the east, Telugu country in the south and


-----

Assam in the north-east. Revealingly, here too we meet miracles: that poet
and co-founder of the movement was blind, we are told, until restored his
vision by Mahima Swami. But having seen how much suffering marred
humanity, he opted for blindness again. What is interesting is that the
Mahima Dharma did not—at least in theory—recognize caste, ritual
discrimination (except for treating Brahmins as unrighteous), tribal blood
rites and image worship. Indeed, in 1881, five years after its founder’s
death, a group of fifteen marched into the great temple at Puri, evidently to
destroy its idols, none of this under missionary instigation. The keystones of
this sect were simply ethical living, non-violence and good conduct, drawn
from regional bhakti traditions as well as Buddhism; it was a message
similar to Roy’s, except it had bubbled up from below. In time, of course, a
Vedic ancestry too would be ‘discovered’ when Mahima Swami’s
successors, without irony, began to Sanskritize and bridge his ideas with
Brahminical Hinduism. But either way, the Mahima Dharma also was born
not out of dialogue with the West, but as a movement within the Hindu
world. [105]

Dayananda, in part, represents something similar, except that as time

passed, he did not hesitate to borrow from Roy’s school of reform. That is,
he was able to reorient his localized, bottom-up campaign with tools that
appeared in direct correspondence with colonialism and Christian
evangelicalism. The process took time: When Dayananda first debated
Brahmins on idolatry, their exchanges were held in Sanskrit—something
that reveals the narrow audience he had in mind. [106] So too it was in
orthodox circles that his reputation as an iconoclast grew: One pandit, in
fact, would meet Dayananda only with a screen hung between them because
it was inauspicious to behold an apostate. [107] But slowly he learnt Hindi to
reach a wider section of north Indian society in their mother tongue, while
also picking up skills that made missionaries such a force in the religious
market. He began, for example, printing pamphlets to spread his
message. [108] He also evinced curiosity about English, seeking texts from
abroad, and asking ‘a Bengali to teach . . . and to read to him Max Müller’s


-----

translation of the Veda’. [109] Schools—a missionary favourite—were set up
to raise a platoon of preachers for Dayananda’s reformed Hinduism. [110]

Despite many hiccups along the way, what we observe here is a ‘traditional’
ascetic very consciously attempting to enter new spaces, using technology,
experimenting (and failing) and even learning from the competition.
Dayananda, that is, unlike many non-cosmopolitan Hindu religious leaders,
brought an added quality to the equation: an entrepreneurial eye to widen
his venture beyond implicit limits.

Interestingly, in this too there is a partial precedent. If Dayananda trekked

up from Kathiawar to the Gangetic belt, a generation before there was a
Brahmin who did the reverse, settling in western India after his own
spiritual peregrinations. This founder of the Swaminarayan sect, Sahajanand
Swami (1781–1830), was, in fact, Roy’s contemporary and was even
compared to him as a reformer. [111] He preached a form of monotheism, but
pivoted not on a formless being but Krishna. Individuals from all castes
were welcomed, even if caste itself was never repudiated. And, like
Dayananda, Sahajanand too was alert to changes in the world, and the
opportunities these presented. For instance, he cultivated the Company’s
government to help establish his sect, which for years faced persecution. In
certain Swaminarayan texts, thus, the Company _gavendra_ (governor) is cast
as a protector. [112] His reform programme also sat well with the British:
Though sati was unusual in Kathiawar, Sahajanand was a vocal critic.
Hearing of him, in fact, the bishop of Calcutta briefly believed he was ‘an
appointed instrument to prepare the way for the Gospel’: a Hindu clearing
the rot for Christians to comprehensively redraw the picture. [113] While that
did not happen, to British writers, Sahajanand—who was seen by his
followers as a living god, maintained in pomp and who travelled with a
veritable army—was exactly the type of reformer they preferred. He was
not radical like Roy, nor did he coopt a Western conceptual language, which
always held risks for British authority. Instead, he sold reform in small,
diplomatic, ‘native’-looking doses. But for our purposes, Sahajanand

matters for one more reason: that even as he built up a ‘traditional’ Hindu
sect, he maneuvered it through a very modern, shifting landscape. [114]

Dayananda, however, did not approve of the Swaminarayan veneration of

Krishna. [115] For the core of _his_ Hinduism— _Arya Dharma_ , faith of the
Aryans—was the Vedas, as with Roy, and a shapeless, formless divinity.
This is not surprising: When with his parents, Dayananda had already
studied the Yajur Veda, in keeping with family convention. [116] His rule was
simple: ‘Whatever was not to be found in the Vedas . . . [was] false and
useless; whatever was found in the Vedas,’ on the contrary, was ‘beyond the
reach of controversy.’ [117] That is, the only area where Dayananda was
unyieldingly dogmatic was Vedic infallibility. [118] But where his Bengali
prior built on the (chronologically later) Upanishads, Dayananda preferred
the Samhitas: the oldest section, with its hymns. The Upanishads were
acceptable, of course, so long as they did not contradict earlier parts; and if
one admitted they were _not_ divine revelation but appendices of human
authorship. But what, then, of deities catalogued in the Samhitas? To
Dayananda, these were not gods, just aspects of the almighty—an
interpretation critics attacked as sophistry, to conceal polytheistic values. [119]

Or as one acerbic writer quipped, Dayananda was a ‘heretical fool’ who
read ‘the Vedas according to the figments of his own imagination’. [120]

Additionally, he viewed most other scriptural sources as ‘false’: the Puranas
provoked Dayananda’s ‘contempt’, for example. [121] Because they
represented decline. An explanation was conjured via a marriage of history
with dramatic license. Five thousand years ago, Dayananda claimed, all
humanity subscribed to the Vedas, and India was paramount in the world.
Indeed, in the epic war of the Mahabharata, every king—including of
America!—sent troops. [122] But after this cataclysm, decay set in. War bred
disunion, the truth of the Vedas was ‘perverted’ and Brahmins became ‘false
spiritual guides’—all at the cost of real Hinduism, hereafter eclipsed by the
Puranas. [123]

In this last point one can identify Protestant influences: Indeed, in

Dayananda’s _Satyarth Prakash_ , a Hindi text produced in the mid-1870s and
then expanded some years later, the term _poplila_ (or ‘popery’ in its English
translation) appears repeatedly, borrowing from Protestant polemics against
the Catholic church. [124] Similarly, like Roy, his tirade against Puranic
Hinduism aligns with missionary views: Worshipping Siva through the
lingam, he argued, was ‘an act of barbarians’; the Vaishnavas’ claims of
divine incarnations were not only nonsense but an insult to intelligence. For
example, if the divine boar Varaha—one of Vishnu’s avatars—lifted the
earth on its tusks, what exactly was the beast standing on? The ‘breast of
the popish author’ of this fable? [125] Understandably, incandescent Hindus
branded Dayananda ‘a Christian in disguise’. [126] But then, he castigated
Christianity too, as well as Jainism and Islam. If Jesus could multiply bread,


-----

‘Why did he not make sweet pudding for himself out of earth, water, [and]
stones’ instead of wandering ‘in his starvation to the fruit of fig trees?’
Islam railed against temple images but in turning to Mecca and its Kaaba,
Dayananda declared, it endorsed ‘a great idol’. As for Jains, their teachers
were plain old ‘sinners’; Dayananda, in fact, blamed this class for spreading
idolatry in India. [127] By the 1870s, in other words, the man who earlier
worked in a relatively slim professional space, engaging with Sanskrit
pandits, grew cognizant of a wider religious public. He realized also that
besides restoring ‘pure’ Hinduism _among_ Hindus, he would have to also
preserve it actively from encroachment by _non_ -Hindus. [128]

For Dayananda, this transition had much to do with a visit to Calcutta

earlier in that decade. In fact, his biographer notes that until his arrival here,


-----

no evidence exists that he ‘even thought about Hinduism in “national”
terms or in . . . comparison with other religions’. [129] What made all the
difference was an encounter with Roy’s successors at the Brahmo Samaj. It
was in Calcutta too that Dayananda read the _Brahmo Dharma_ (1848), a
Samaj guidebook, the influence of which is pronounced in his own _Satyarth_
_Prakash_ . [130] Put simply, the very idea of packaging his ideology in book
form may have been inspired by the English-speaking reformers in Bengal.
The world of the ‘traditional’ Hindu connected with Roy’s, growing
stronger for it. Soon Dayananda was doing lecture tours in cities; after
Calcutta, in 1874, he went to Bombay, where his own venture, the Arya
Samaj, was founded. ‘His long and mostly fruitless efforts’ in pilgrim towns
in upper India had, we discover, taught Dayananda ‘that the regeneration of
Hinduism would not be effected through pandits and the brahmins: they had
too big a stake in the status quo’. Instead, urban elites—men walking in
Roy’s footsteps—were more receptive to new ideas and fresh
interpretations of old ones. [131] It was another issue that these figures did not
entirely agree with Dayananda. But as one senior personage explained,
‘What does it matter’ if there was partial discordance? So long as enough
points did ‘accord with our principles’, cooperation was justified. [132] And
so, Dayananda—a sturdy, six-foot-tall sanyasi who once lived near-naked in
forests—won legitimacy among India’s coat-wearing, English-speaking,
armchair intellectuals.

In fact, Dayananda had an advantage over Roy when it came to winning

supporters. He was at a glance a Hindu ascetic: This endowed him with a
degree of general reverence wherever he went—an appeal a worldly,
cosmopolitan figure like Roy could never command. Secondly, he travelled
extensively and had lived among the people—again a different setting from
Roy and his lordly existence. But most critically, Dayananda’s openness to
learning from the urban reformist set, and _blending_ it with his own mission,
brought him long-awaited success. His idea of Hinduism was sculpted
originally with his blind guru in ‘traditional’ settings, but he adopted
strategies of the ‘modern’ city reformers in marketing that idea. That is, if


-----

Roy united Eastern and Western principles, Dayananda did so with impulses
_within_ India among different classes. This may be why the orthodoxy saw
him as particularly menacing. As early as 1869, in Benares, after a debate
with orthodox pandits, he was attacked. [133] As his fame grew, so did risks:
In Poona in the next decade, after Dayananda delivered lectures, his hosts
held a procession with their guest perched on an elephant. A rival party
responded with a march ‘honoring a donkey as a mock saint’—in the end,
stones were hurled and things nearly escalated into a riot. [134] Apparently,
there were also attempts to murder him, and his death in 1883 after a
painful illness is ascribed to poison; in hagiographies, Dayananda
understandingly forgives his treacherous cook. [135] His wicked enemies, we
are informed, even weaponized lust—they sent him a woman once, hoping
to mince his reputation for celibacy, post coitus. Except when the lady
arrived, she observed ‘a mystic light’ all around her target and instead of
disrobing, was reduced to ‘shedding tears of penitence’. [136] It wasn’t a
miracle, à la Ramalinga, but it came close. Dayananda too, that is, did not
occupy the world of the purely ‘rational’. Enough was invested in emotion
also. [137]

Understandably, then, Dayananda did not always pass tests of reason.

One Hindu critic would declare ‘Dayanandism’ a ‘sham’ based on a
mischievous interpretation of the Vedas. [138] A Christian noted, similarly, that
if ‘Dayanandis’ were challenged with points countering their preceptor’s
claims, these were craftily played down as metaphorical. For example,
Vedic animal sacrifice—how could this be symbolic when there were rules
on ‘slaughtering . . . distribution of the various parts, the method of cooking
and the way of eating’ the animal? [139] One man even branded Dayananda a
‘dangerous _enemy_ of the Veda’. [140] But the sanyasi was unmoved: Past
interpretations of the great scriptures were simply flawed; he, meanwhile,
had cracked the code to reach the right conclusions. In fact, as he became
aware of Western technology, Dayananda pinned these also to his favourite
texts: a step that permitted him to scorn foreign advances, while
nevertheless appropriating them for Hindus. Or as Müller wrote, ‘Steam-


-----

engines, railways, and steam-boats, all were shown to have been known, at
least in their germs, to the poets of the Vedas’. [141] He was not exaggerating.
The _Satyarth Prakash_ tells, for example, of guns in ancient India; that all
the ‘sciences and arts’ in ‘the whole world’ had ‘their original start’ in Vedic
minds. [142] Future writers would put this down to an inferiority complex, [143]

but for what it was worth, Dayananda lashed out at Müller too, decrying
him as a hopeless scholar; [144] as an imposter whose real design was to
subject Hindus to the Bible. [145] Stubbornly dismissing all criticism, then,
Dayananda clung to his view that the Vedas were the source of everything.
Or as he said to a missionary once: ‘I do not believe there is a single error in
any of the Vedas.’ And ‘if you show me one I will maintain that it is the
interpolation of a clever scoundrel’. [146]

All along, boosted by growing success, in the second half of the 1870s,

Dayananda developed a political project: a renaissance backed by India’s
Hindu princes. This was a proposal his guru had also entertained, and with
good reason. After all, even if the British ruled 60 per cent of the country,
the rest was under the control of ‘native’ royalty. And properly directed,
these men—who owned resources and social capital—could do much to
propel Dayananda’s vision. In 1877, he went to a durbar hosted by the
governor general to proclaim Queen Victoria empress of India; most of the
land’s princes had gathered here, opening the possibility of wooing them as
a class. [147] Nothing came of it. Next, in 1881, Dayananda landed in Udaipur,
whose ruler was one of India’s highest-ranking Hindu princes. For six
months he stayed here and certainly made an impression, even if not all his
prescriptions worked: Dayananda expected the maharajah to go
monogamous, while the latter startled his visitor by suggesting he head a
Saiva institution—and, more gently, cease attacking image worship. [148] Still,
Dayananda was quite optimistic when he went to Jodhpur next. Evidently,
this state was full of Vaishnava ‘fanatics’ and the sanyasi warned: ‘The
more stubborn the perversity of a people, the stronger should be the
remedies employed to uproot it.’ [149] Except, however, that its prince was
uninterested. He hosted his visitor and treated him well but showed little


-----

further resolve. [150] Dayananda even sent the maharajah letters of
admonishment, with no effect. In fact, Arya Samaj accounts insist that the
primary obstacle was a royal concubine; or in a more vivid rendering, a
‘base bitch’. [151] Interestingly, the same lady—Nanhi Jaan—is accused of
plotting the poisoning that allegedly killed Dayananda soon afterwards. [152]

But if rousing princes—a proposition Hindu nationalists would again

consider a half-century later—failed, Dayananda had success galvanizing
ordinary people towards action. That is, he began identifying causes with
the potential to unite Hindus, otherwise fragmented into castes and sects. [153]

The cow offered itself here as an option: castes, middling and high, all held
the animal sacred, and Dayananda urged them to proactively protect it. [154]

Reverence for the cow also had the benefit of separating not only the beefeating British but also Muslims from Hindus. Dayananda’s views first
appeared in an economic shape. Deploying arithmetic, he argued that ‘the
milk of one milch-cow’ could ‘support 25,730 persons’ in the great scheme
of things. So too, ‘three yokes of oxen’ raised ‘48,000 lbs of corn’, feeding
thousands. On the other hand, if the cow were _eaten_ , it could only ‘appease
. . . 80 carnivorous persons’. [155] In short, cow slaughter was bad economics:
a line addressed to men of reason. But in 1882, Dayananda also highlighted
the cow’s emotional appeal, founding the Gaurakshini Sabha (‘CowProtection Association’), members of which turned public squares into
pulpits. Understandably, this provoked violence with Muslims, [156] while
also serving as a means to coerce ‘bad’ Hindus—beef-eating low castes—
into turning ‘good’ by accepting Brahminical values. [157] And after 1888,
when a British court held that the cow did not fall under the category of ‘an
object held sacred’, and was _not_ protected by law, [158] its protection was
transformed into a nationalist issue. Indeed, in 1893, the colonial state was
surprised to find massive numbers of peasants signing cow-protection
petitions. [159] That is, men from various linguistic and caste communities
began to visibly constitute a united Hindu front under the banner of the
divine bovine. Or as the governor general recorded, the cow ‘supplied the
whole of the disloyal elements . . . with a popular backing which they could


-----

not have obtained from any other source’. [160] In fact, by 1907, Dayananda’s
organization would be branded seditious, suspected by hyper-paranoid
officials of plotting the overthrow of the British. [161]

Funnily enough, when Dayananda died, it was believed that the Arya

Samaj he founded would fade into obscurity along with its pet causes. Or as
Müller wrote in an obituary:

India is in a process of religious fermentation, and new cells are constantly thrown out,
while old ones burst and disappear. For a time this kind of liberal orthodoxy started by
Dayananda may last; but the mere contact with Western thought, and more particularly
with Western scholarship, will eventually extinguish it. It is different with [Roy’s]
Brahma-Samaj . . . They do not fear the West; on the contrary they welcome it; and
though that movement too may change its name and character, there is every prospect that

it will in the end lead to a complete regeneration in the religious life of India. [162]

But the sanyasi belied his British critic’s prophecy. For it was the _Brahmo_
Samaj that faded, all but vanishing by the next century. [163] Meanwhile, the
Arya Samaj, which already had nearly seventy-nine branches at the time of
its founder’s death, firmly planted itself in India. Today, it runs thousands of
schools, hospitals, colleges and orphanages, with large international wings.
The anglicized gentlemen’s Hinduism exemplified by Roy’s disciples, with
its god of reason, did not flourish. [164] Instead, Dayananda’s message—
despite feuds between his moderate and radical followers—found welcome
with millions. On the one hand, it crafted a middle-class Hinduism,
especially in Punjab and upper India. Or as a commentator put it, it was the
faith of the ‘minor civil servants, schoolmasters, local pleaders, medical
practitioners, and other active citizens’. [165] On the other, it positioned itself
as ‘an effective competitor to [Christian] missions’, ‘dogging the
missionary movement, copying its organizations . . . and countering its
strategies at every turn’. [166] Indeed, within a few years, Hindu reform
receded as Samaj workers instead channelled energy towards puncturing the
hopes of _rival_ faiths; it became a defensive enterprise, evincing a ‘patriotic
antagonism’ towards competitors. [167] Or as Gandhi would wryly note: ‘The
Arya Samaj preacher is never so happy as when he is reviling other


-----

religions.’ [168] Most significantly, _shuddhi_ (purification) schemes were
developed, to re-convert those who departed Hinduism for Christianity or
Islam. In 1913, 9000 persons, thus, were reclaimed in Jammu; in 1923,
15,000 in Rajputana followed. [169] Just as Francis Xavier some centuries
before converted villages en masse in the south, now in the north converts
were recouped—also en masse.

The Arya Samaj, that is, was transformed into an organism nobody had

seen in India before: a Hindu evangelical movement. [170] And a uniform
Hindu identity was no longer an intellectual argument alone; it was
acquiring muscle to remake reality. [171] Viewed another way, where Roy set
the stage with a theoretical basis for defending Hinduism, Dayananda went
a step further: He became the grandfather of a mass-based Hindu
_nationalism_ . There was only one problem, though, blocking the rise of this
new politicized Hindu identity. And the name of that problem was caste.
For if Hindus were internally a divided people—where Brahmins ran even
from the ‘polluting’ shadows of their lowborn countrymen—how could they
unite in the face of external foes like the missionary? Furthermore, the
lowborn were now discovering their own power and voice, rejecting the
pretensions of their self-appointed superiors. So much so, that Hinduism—
under siege from the outside—looked like it might also crumble from
within.

When in 1875 Dayananda came lecturing to Poona, among the men he met
was a middle-aged radical called Jotirao Phule. [172] Born in 1827 to a
greengrocer, Phule came from the Mali caste of gardeners. It was one of the
area’s middling communities: not so high as to assert elite status but not so
low as to be condemned to untouchability. Additionally, his family was
prosperous: Phule’s grandfather had served as official florist to the Peshwa’s
household before the Company takeover, and in this capacity owned a gift
of tax-free land. His maternal family, similarly, were headmen in a nearby
village. Among his peers, then, Phule belonged to what might be described
as the cream. [173] Even so, little suggested this Mali boy would one day
become a public icon; that long before Gandhi made the term familiar, _he_
would be addressed as _mahatma_ (great soul). Like most children, Phule
went to a vernacular school, acquiring basic literacy and arithmetic skills.
As his next logical step, he joined his father’s trade and would have


-----

remained there until it was time for his own issue to someday follow.
Except that Phule’s road took an unusual turn. For in his teens, he went
back to school—this time, at a Christian mission that taught English. It was
a life-defining experience. And within a short span, it transformed this latest
recruit into one of modern India’s great anti-caste ideologues. Indeed, by
the time Phule died in 1890, many viewed him as the ‘father of Indian
social revolution’. [174] Which is not to say he was universally admired
among all Hindus: One Brahmin likened him, in sarcasm, to a ‘jewel’—
among the mean and lowborn, that is. [175]

Phule’s life, in fact, exemplifies one of those little discussed

consequences of colonialism in India: the political mobilization of
subordinate castes, which successfully utilized British rule to bargain for
just treatment from their traditional superiors. [176] It is proof of how
missionary activities too, even as they incensed Hindu elites, offered
marginalized sections of brown society a toolkit for self-assertion and
agency. [177] Plain numbers demonstrate the impact: In 1819, the BMS alone
had 7000 students in their schools, and the LMS, 4000; in the 1820s, it was
estimated that a total of almost 40,000 students were under instruction in
evangelical institutions. [178] To be clear, neither mission schools nor British
officials actively intended to alter power dynamics within Hindu society.
Governor Elphinstone, for example, argued _against_ encouraging English
education among low castes. [179] As rulers, white men preferred courting
elite Hindus exclusively, seeing in them ideal consumers of Western
learning. For missionaries, meanwhile, schools were an instrument for
conversion, not a charitable scheme to produce local reformers. English
education was only the ‘preparing of a mine . . . which shall one day
explode and tear up the whole [of Hinduism] from its lowest depths’. [180]

Exposing ‘natives’ to Western science came with the expectation that they
would ‘lose confidence in [their] own religion’, allowing for the missionary
to flush out the debris and point to the true faith. Schools even helped
promote the Bible; added with other textbooks, ‘no Hindoo would ever
scent persecution’. [181] But as often happens, the results of such plans did not


-----

match their sponsors’ calculations. For if some ‘natives’ converted—
causing serious social tremors [182] —most simply picked up ideas from their
teachers, refashioning these to alter arrangements within the Hindu world.
Phule, though no enemy of conversion, [183] was one such beneficiary. He
learnt from missionaries but adapted their strategies to his own anti-caste
activism. [184]

As with many others, it was reading that made Phule the man he would

become. Having joined the mission school, he partook of its usual academic
menu. But English meant that literature of another type was also accessible,
especially given that this period saw the germination of Indian nationalism.
In 1848, certain English-speaking Brahmins gave Phule and his friends a
copy of Thomas Paine’s _Rights of Man_ (1791), hoping to fire up hostility
towards the British. Our reader, however, saw in Paine ‘potential for
radicalism of a very different kind’. [185] To begin with, he was inspired not
only to think about men but also the prerogatives of women. And he was,
first and foremost, a doer. Unlike many high-caste reformers who made fine
propositions in public but failed to enact these in domestic settings, Phule
began at home. His wife, Savitribai (1831–97), had entered his life as an
illiterate child bride. Not only did Phule share school lessons now, his
support for her individuality was such that in time, she would emerge as a
poet and activist in her own right. [186] Savitribai eventually attended a
mission institution, qualifying to teach as well—one of her poems, in fact,
celebrates the emancipatory power of ‘Mother English’. [187] Unsurprisingly,
the first venture Phule and she launched in 1848, inspired by
missionaries, [188] was a girls’ school. But what made it historic was their
declaration that they would open up education to all classes, including
‘untouchables’ (Dalits). And of course, such boldness came at a price:
Within a year, Phule’s scandalized family threw the couple out. [189]

Their experience with promoting education among marginalized groups

would, however, go a long way in shaping Phule’s future ideology. That


-----

first school they established, for instance, did not last, because most Hindu
students refused to sit at an equality with Dalits. So, a little later when the
Phules made a second effort, they had to separate ritually ‘polluted’ pupils
into an exclusive institution, instead of mixing them with the ‘clean’. [190] The
affair was instructive of how deeply set caste was among Hindus. But
compromise did not end their ostracization. In 1856, Savitribai’s brother
was still berating her for tutoring Dalits. Our lady, not one to give up before
‘idiots’—and in full possession of the courage of her convictions—insisted
that she and her husband were doing ‘God’s own work’. [191] Here again we
see the appropriation of missionary language, with different goals. But
brave words aside, life was difficult. If in 1852 they were lauded by the
British for their ‘labours in the cause of education’, [192] harassment was also
in perennial pursuit. Much of this was aimed at Savitribai—a childless,
educated woman who rejected domesticity—and she was often pelted with
stones and dung as she walked to work. Remarkably, she did not recoil:
Savitribai simply began, it is said, to carry an extra pair of clothes whenever
she stepped out. [193] With time, she got bolder. In 1868, thus, while at her
maternal home, she heard of a couple—a Brahmin man and a Dalit girl—
who were about to be murdered for an inter-caste romantic dalliance. ‘I
rushed to the spot and scared’ the mob away, she wrote, warning the irate
folk of ‘grave consequences’. [194]

The consequences she referred to was punishment under British law,

which by now superseded customary, caste-based punishment. This was to
become a key plank for the Phules: the window colonialism opened for
change, not least by way of criminal law which did not discriminate
between castes. In fact, Phule would be accused of showing a little too
much _rajabhakti_ (uncritical loyalty) to the British; of being a missionary in
Hindu clothing. [195] One can sense why. While at one point he harboured
anti-colonial feelings, by his own admission, his perspective soon
shifted. [196] Political freedom as urged by (mostly) high-caste thinkers lost its
appeal; instead, _social_ liberation seemed more urgent. The chains Phule
wished to throw off were caste, superstition and Hinduism itself—by which


-----

he meant the ‘selfish counterfeit faith’ of the Brahmins. [197] This, in fact, set
him apart from most reformers of the time. Their articulation of change
accommodated modern values within the Hindu fold. By design, they did
not repudiate Hinduism. Phule, though, felt no such emotional allegiance.
Instead, he used rational elements of the missionary critique to examine his
culture. Colonialism, to him, had divested Hindu elites of power; lower
orders, contrastingly, found _hope_ in British rule. [198] So too if men like
Dayananda, while acknowledging its flaws, never rejected caste itself,
Phule was allergic to the very principle. It came from two different ways of
viewing the world. Caste was foundational to Hindus because their society
was ‘order-oriented rather than justice-oriented’. That is, Hinduism’s
diversity made finding equilibrium between the many its main priority, not
equality. [199] Phule, though, was drawn to a bolder idea—to him, deliverance
lay in modern egalitarianism, not inherited hierarchy.

This comes through in his act of dedicating his famous 1873 polemic,

_Gulamgiri_ (‘Slavery’), to the ‘Good People of the United States’ for
abolishing ‘Negro Slavery’ (sic). [200] His determination to educate Dalits also
stemmed from the same ideals. Indeed, Phule parted ways with some
associates because the latter evidently held basic literacy adequate for
Dalits. Phule, however, urged _education_ , not tokenism. [201] His appeals to the
British were also framed in words of justice and humanity. In his
_Brahmanache Kasab_ ( _Priestcraft Exposed_ , 1869), for example, he asks how
Queen Victoria, who presided over the termination of slavery in the British
empire, was blind to the suffering of her low-caste Hindu subjects. [202] In
schools he founded, children recited: ‘Tell Grandma we are a happy nation,
but [millions] are without education.’ [203] This thrust on (Western) learning
as a pathway to social awakening appears in most of his publications. In an
1855 play, thus, a peasant couple are hoodwinked by a cunning Brahmin
peddling hocus-pocus and threatening grave consequences on their unborn
child. Joining emotional blackmail with gaslighting, he swindles them. But
then enters a missionary, bringing light and common sense. Rapidly, he
breaks the peasants’ faith in stone gods, and exposes the Brahmin as a


-----

charlatan. Yet, in the end, the man and his wife decide to remedy their
ignorance not by converting but by enrolling in one of Phule’s night
schools; education is recognized as their passport to wisdom. [204] In 1882,
Phule would also feature among those rare nineteenth-century voices
endorsing compulsory primary education. [205]

But appeals to the public required more than just a rationalistic argument

if they were to excite action; they needed emotional stimulants. Which
meant Phule had to also tell a _story_ with heroes and villains. Where
nationalists pointed to the British as the bad men, our reformer found his
antagonists in Brahmins. To him, in fact, this class was the personification
of all that was evil in Hindu society. As such, this position has a history.
Tamil Saiva saints, for example, did not hesitate to take a similar stand in
medieval times. [206] In the Maharashtra region itself, there was a ‘tradition of
tension’ with Brahmins, who, under the Peshwas, had been a ruling class
until 1818. [207] Besides, there was the memory of bhakti poets like Tukaram,
incidentally also a grocer. ‘He who refuses to touch [Dalits],’ this
seventeenth-century thinker sang, ‘has a polluted mind . . . a man is only as
chaste as his own belief.’ [208] So, as with Dayananda and Roy, Phule’s vision
too might be linked with existing traditions of dissent within Hinduism. [209]

Like those men, he too enlisted a novel reading of history for his cause.
Factually speaking, for example, many segments of Hindu society,
including kings and landed elites, were invested in caste. [210] Thus, well
before the Peshwas, non-Brahmin Maratha kings of the province actively
sustained this system. [211] Phule, however, hoped to unite all non-Brahmin
groups under a common label—Sudras (the lowest of the four-fold
hierarchy in Sanskrit scripture), leaving only Brahmins beyond the pale. So,
in _his_ writings, caste is the devious offspring of priestcraft, born to chain
Hindus under a selfish elite. This, of course, was a stance missionaries took;
they also believed that Brahmins—in reality a diverse, fragmented class,
with internal dissonances— _imposed_ all that was ugly in Hinduism with
totalitarian power. [212] Phule embraced and then expanded on this
(admittedly simplistic) theory.


-----

Critically, in the process he would redefine the idea of being ‘native’.

Simply stated, the entire lot of people now subject to the British could not
claim this tag. It applied, he argued, only to non-Brahmins. Or to cite
Savitribai, Sudras alone were India’s true ‘natives’. [213] In giving this idea
legs, Phule—whose writings reveal his eclectic reading, with references to
everyone from George Washington to Darwin—seized on prevailing
(Western) scholarly notions of an ancient Aryan invasion of the country.
This, he claimed, proved ‘beyond a shadow of doubt that the Brahmans’ had
come as ‘conquerors’ to India; they were a ‘race’, ‘highly cunning, arrogant,
and bigoted’. Proof was located in the Brahmins’ own texts—Vedic
references, thus, of wars between gods and demons were ‘the distorted
reflection’ [214] of conflict between Aryans (Brahmins) and India’s natives
(Sudras). The victors’ faith spread through violence that would shame even
Nero. Indeed, Phule declared, the Brahmins’ ancestors did not hesitate to
order ‘wholesale extermination’ even. [215] Over thousands of years they then
subjugated the Sudras psychologically, foisting _khote grantha_ (false books)
on them, [216] as well as a religion that prostrated them from birth to death,
with unnecessary ceremonies, pilgrimages and expensive donations. [217]

Brahminism, ‘like the coils of a serpent’, ensnared Hindus; [218] all of Hindu
history emerged from an original race war. [219] In fact, Phule looked warmly
at the arrival of Islamic power in India: By smashing temples and Brahmin
control, Muslims _nearly_ liberated Sudras from bondage. [220] While that did
not yield lasting results, in the present, there was opportunity again to find
freedom via the British—also despatched by god. [221] Indeed, Hindus had
reason to be grateful for foreign rule; if, Phule declared, they had learnt
humaneness despite living in the toxic world of caste, it was thanks to white
men. [222]

Infuriating conservatives, Phule also attacked Puranic Hinduism in a

pungently satirical tone. The Vedas hold a verse suggesting Brahmins are
superior to all because they sprang from the head of the creator, Brahma;
Sudras, on the other hand, emerged from his feet. But Phule had some
questions: Was Brahma’s head also a uterus? Did he menstruate? When the


-----

Brahmin infant was born, did the creator breastfeed it? [223] On Vishnu’s
avatars: Narasimha, the man-lion emerged from a pillar, but who cut the
umbilical cord? [224] Parasurama, another incarnation, was said to be
immortal. But had anyone seen him lately? Phule promptly wrote an open
letter—dated 1 August 1872—demanding that the Puranic hero present
himself in six months. [225] Ravana had ten heads with as many mouths; it
was ‘miraculous’ that he got through life with a single rectum. [226]

Essentially, then, tales recorded in Sanskrit were rubbish; _Aesop’s Fables_
were a thousand times better. [227] As for everyday ritual practices, the less
said the better. Brahmins ‘purify themselves by drinking the urine of the
cow’—a reference to how a small quantity of the said substance is sprinkled
with other products of the animal to sanctify persons and places. And yet, if
offered clean water by a Sudra, they deemed it impure. [228] In what is equally
interesting, while Phule attacked the ‘higher’ Hindu gods, he presented folk
deities like Khandoba—venerated chiefly by non-Brahmins—as historical
heroes, deified for resisting Aryans during those early days of conflict. [229]

That is, at a time when most Hindu intellectuals played down the ‘inferior’
deities, Phule positioned them as emblems of respect and resistance.
Predictably, his critics rolled their eyes: That snarky Brahmin critic cited
before announced, for instance, that our grocer’s son was so towering a man
of ideas, he exceeded Gibbon in achievement. [230]

Importantly, this set Phule apart from other subaltern reformers of the

day. In Travancore, for example, Narayana Guru (1856–1928) rose as
spiritual leader to the Ezhavas: a populous but ‘polluting’ community. Like
Dayananda, he too wandered a great deal in his early years, meditating in
caves and debating with sanyasis, till he arrived at his most famous maxim:
that there is only one caste (humanity), one religion and one god. [231] In
1888, he set up a Siva shrine for Ezhavas—an act of defiance, considering
that temple consecration for ‘higher’ deities was the Brahmins’ preserve. He
established, that is, ‘counter temples’ for low-caste groups. [232] Like Phule,
the guru was blunt—when in the 1920s, Gandhi asked him if Hinduism
offered means for spiritual liberation, he nodded, adding though that people


-----

needed worldly liberty too. [233] Yet, unlike Phule, Guru’s reforms entailed a
degree of Sanskritization, including adopting the habits of high-caste
Hindus; it was not a total defiance of Brahminical authority. Thus, speaking
of toddy-tapping, a vocation associated with Ezhavas, he proclaimed: ‘The
tapper’s body stinks, his clothes stink, his house stinks, whatever he touches
stinks.’ Ezhavas must give up this impure profession; those who demurred
were to be treated like a ‘diseased limb’. [234] Blood sacrifices and rites with
alcohol for ‘evil gods’ were replaced, similarly, by conscious association
with ‘civilized gods’. [235] He also urged learning of the Vedas and Hindu
philosophy, and, himself a Sanskrit scholar, taught these. [236] So in some
respects, Guru’s reform lay in rejecting Brahminism as a social practice,
while democratizing Brahminical Hinduism. [237] In time, tales of miraculous
powers coalesced around him too, besides. [238]

This was not Phule’s style; nobody could transform him into a

conventional guru. [239] Indeed, his fierce anti-Brahminism meant that he lost
several friends over the years. [240] And the hostility of his pen was linked to a
living, visible reality of Brahmin dominance. Brahmins—with their history
in the literate professions—had embraced Western education, going on to
then populate most of the colonial bureaucracy. Or as Phule wrote, there
was a monopoly even in the villages, where Brahmin accountants possessed
more clout than non-Brahmin headmen. [241] Historically this was a reversal
of things: Before centralized, bureaucratic political systems emerged, those
headmen had been stronger. So much so that one Sanskrit poet even
complained how in ‘every village a Sudra acts like master [sic]’ with
Brahmins timidly serving as clerks. [242] In nineteenth-century India,
however, not only did the British ‘view men and things through Brahmin
spectacles’, they also outsourced governance to Brahmin minions. [243] The
latter were nepotistic and corrupt in turn, doing all they could to prevent
rival castes from entering the fray. [244] Similarly, the government erred in
pumping resources into higher education, where Brahmins dominated. (In
fact, in Madras it would be found in the last decade of Phule’s life, that of
1346 graduates, almost nine hundred were Brahmins. [245] ) Even in schools,


-----

Brahmin teachers could not sympathize with non-Brahmin pupils. [246]

Urging for an expansion of village schools, Phule advised, therefore, to do
‘away with all Brahmin school-masters!’ [247] The Sudras, after all, Phule
concluded, ‘are the life and sinews of the country’; the British would do
well to recognize this. And as if offering an incentive, he added that if their
‘hearts and minds’ were ‘made happy’, the British could count on ‘their
loyalty’. [248] In other words, to obtain social justice, Phule was willing to
subordinate political liberty.

One might see in Phule’s tone a tendency to vilify Brahmins beyond

reason. But fiery language aside—where he called them ‘pen-wielding
butchers’, for instance [249] —Phule was not wrong in alleging a Brahmin
territoriality in sharing space with others. Part of his own legend tells how
his education was first cut short by a Brahmin accountant in his father’s
shop; the latter feared that the boy, if properly schooled, would deprive him
of his job. [250] So too the response of Brahmin intellectuals to ideas of social
justice reveal insecurity. Phule’s younger contemporary, B.G. Tilak (1856–
1920), later to become a leading nationalist, resisted all that Phule urged.
Educating girls risked ‘castrating’ Hinduism; [251] doing so in English was
worse—it would have a ‘dewomanising’ influence. [252] Saddled with too
much knowledge, educated women would become ‘a dead weight on their
husbands’, forgetting their duty as ‘helpmates’. [253] So also, Tilak was
against educating all castes, seeing in it the threat of cultural ‘destruction’;
the shattering of ‘reverence’ towards Brahmins and orthodox Hinduism. [254]

What was the purpose, besides, of teaching peasants mathematics and
geography? It offered no advantages in ‘practical life’. These were people
for whom education was ‘unsuited’; men should only be granted learning,
Tilak explained, ‘befitting their rank and station’. [255] To him, all this talk of
the ‘doctrine of the equality of mankind’ was really a handle for dividing
Hindu society. [256] Put simply, internal hierarchies, as presented by custom,
must not be questioned. To do so was to succumb to anti-national, Western
influences: an ironic claim, given the number of Brahmins who ‘oiled the
wheels of colonialism’, drawing salaries for it. [257]


-----

This is not to say no Brahmins supported Phule. In fact, when he founded

his Satyashodhak (‘Truth-Seeking’) Samaj in 1873, three were involved. [258]

This was one of several organizations that sprouted in western India in the
last decades of the nineteenth century. The Paramahansa Mandali twentyfour years prior, with matching vigour of intention, had prayed, for
example, for a ‘fusion of castes’, an end to image worship, and for women’s
rights. [259] It was, however, a secret society, and after its existence leaked,
was dissolved. But even if in private, the Mandali had flirted with boldness:
Its members hosted a meal once where men of several castes dined
together: so violent an assault on custom, that attendees wore veils. [260]

Phule’s contemporary, G.H. Deshmukh (1823–92), also shared his views,
even if he wasn’t as blunt. Brahminhood, he argued—as did Dayananda—
came from action, not birth. There was proof, Deshmukh added, in the
scriptures for this. Brahmins, even if they were once noble, could not, he
added, escape charges of corruption in the present. As for British rule:
Hindu society was in a lamentable state; god had sent the English as a
wake-up call. [261] Interestingly, he too criticized India’s colonial rulers for
vesting too much faith in one class of people. Except where Phule, in
making that charge, meant Brahmins, Deshmukh was highlighting
disparities between white officials (in higher posts) and ‘natives’
(languishing below). [262] But Deshmukh’s more sober tone still invited much
criticism. Which perhaps explains why Phule dispensed with coyness and
took on tradition more openly. Interestingly, he came to Brahmin reformers’
defence when they were threatened by conservatives: this is why Phule and
his supporters were among those protecting Dayananda during his Poona
visit. [263] But for all that, he never found Brahmin reformers sincere. As a
biographer put it, they ‘believed in social evolution’; Phule wanted a
blazing ‘revolution’. [264]

By the time he died, Phule was in a difficult way, [265] having also suffered

a stroke in 1889. While he had run several solid businesses, [266] his social
projects had slowly drained him of capital. His lack of diplomacy alienated
powerful interests—as late as the 1920s, a proposal to erect a statue of


-----

Phule in Poona generated resistance from Brahmin nationalists. [267] Towards
the end, his friends were writing to a Maratha prince—who Phule wooed, as
Dayananda had the Rajputs—to support him. [268] It was a sad end for a man
of such fearlessness. But nonetheless, he left a colossal footprint: Already
from the 1870s, sections of his own Mali community had stopped using
Brahmins’ services. [269] Moreover, he defined for his followers what he
believed was the true religion; principles by which Hindus should live after
throwing off Brahminism. There was to be, for instance, no idol worship;
good morals were critical, including women’s equality; caste distinctions
had to die, for division of a single species was unnatural; the Vedas were
not to be viewed as special, for if god had meant it for everyone, he would
not have put it in an obscure language; no sacred text was error-free; men
and women must never surrender reason; the ancient past should never be
romanticized, for men have always been flawed and in general, ethical
conduct must be the measure of a godly life. Phule also paid homage to
Islam and Christianity for their tenets of equality—ultimately the
foundation of any decent society. This, to him, sat in sharp contrast to
Brahminical thought, where some were _bhudeva_ s (‘gods on earth’) and the
rest inferior. [270]

But the strongest thrust for Phule remained education. Or as a poem by

his wife, Savitribai, who died seven years after him, tending to plague
victims, goes:

Arise my untouchable brothers
Wake up

To break the chains of tradition!
Wake up

For education . . .! [271]

As the twentieth century approached, Hinduism and Hindus were in a state
of flux. Many felt that pressure for change, both to resist colonialism and to


-----

forge a nation. But ‘Hindu reformers and publicists disagreed with each
other on the constituents of reformed Hinduism.’ [272] On the one hand,
thanks to men like Roy, there was an intellectual, philosophical picture,
particularly useful when framing Hinduism as a coherent world religion
before Western audiences. It was this Hinduism, for instance, that the monk
Swami Vivekananda (1863–1902) highlighted at the 1893 World’s
Parliament of Religions in Chicago to great applause. Then there was
emergent Hindu nationalism, as represented in its early form by
Dayananda’s followers, actively rousing men to action in service of the cow
and in opposition to Muslims and missionaries. Here, we find a more
aggressive Hinduism, unafraid to soil its hands, and dismissive of
intellectual views as defined on Western terms. But there was also
contradiction in efforts to unify Hindus, as appears in Phule’s anti-caste
activism. This spotlighted cleavages _within_ Hindu society. Viewed from this
prism, Roy’s romanticized Hinduism was a façade; the reality was less
beautiful. Nationalism too, this school of thought would suggest, was a
mischievous effort to subdue the low castes; an overplaying of the British
threat to nip internal revolution. And as the Hindu identity consolidated
itself, successors of Phule like B.R. Ambedkar—who would give India its
post-colonial constitution—were ever present to point to its paradoxes. [273]

But what of the great mass of ordinary Hindus? Many found Roy’s

presentation attractive, even if, without irony, they continued to patronize
temples and Puranic beliefs. With Dayananda, they saw practical value in a
muscular identity, even if violence was discomfiting. As for Phule: caste
was simply too entrenched. For the most part, Hindus would, therefore, pay
this mahatma homilies, cordially ignoring his scalding radicalism. The
advent of a nationalized Hindu identity, then, was riddled with
inconsistences. So, in the end it would take another generation before a
Hindu ideologue identified a means to transcend these; to draw a vision of
‘Hinduness’ to surmount its most gaping infirmities. And as much as this
man was in favour of Luther-like reform, he was also a champion of direct
action. To some, then, he is the father of Hindu resurgence; others see in
him a dangerous prophet of violence.

#### SEVEN

 DRAWING BLOOD

In the last week of July 1908, the city of Bombay exploded in a frenzy. The
‘native town,’ the _Bombay Gazette_ reported, was ‘seething with anger.’
Millworkers—the backbone of the region’s booming cotton industry—
struck work, raining stones on the police as they advanced through the
streets in the thousands. ‘It is a marvel,’ the newspaper announced, that ‘the
officers escaped alive’. [1] Firing was resorted to and by the end, fifteen men
were killed and many dozen more wounded, including boys as young as
thirteen. [2] Some of the chaos leaked into the districts. In Nagpur, a mob
attacked a European academic; [3] outside the temple-town of Pandharpur, a
female missionary was lynched and left for dead by a crowd of forty. [4] In
what prompted even greater anxiety in Bombay, the loyalty of the ‘native’
component of the police was in doubt. They shared, after all, an ethnic
background with the rioting millworkers and seemed to have acted with a
strange lethargy in the crisis. [5] Pro-government newspapers, though, gave
events a different spin: It was third-party ‘emissaries’ who actively inflamed
the men of the mills, most of whom had no clue why they were agitating.
All responsibility was laid with a mischievous ‘imported agency’,
unreflective of the broader, submissive public. [6] The British were firmly in
charge, these voices insisted, and there was no reason for alarm—an
assertion, which in its very necessity, betrayed the opposite.

The events of that week were triggered by a stubborn enemy of India’s

rulers. On the night of 22 July, B.G. Tilak—a ‘well-known author’, an exprofessor of mathematics and ‘sometime member of the Bombay
Legislative Council’—was sentenced to six years in prison on charges of
sedition. [7] As a police report subsequently put it, this Brahmin had ‘steadily


-----

been growing in popularity’, and many viewed him ‘as a man actuated
wholly by his desire to ameliorate the condition of Indians’. Wherever he
gave addresses, ‘he gained adherents’, but even in general, his reputation
was high, ‘especially amongst the working classes’. He was much admired
in western India, and ‘in countless houses pictures of him are hung on the
wall’. [8] Given that Tilak was also ‘the ablest and most dangerous of the

[anti-British] party in this country’, the goal when taking him to trial was to
deal as ‘shrewd a blow’ as possible, and ‘show to all waverers the strength
of Government’. [9] Except that the ploy backfired. Tilak’s conviction only
generated ‘sympathy on the part of the people’; even the capitalist class,
otherwise ‘perfectly satisfied with British rule’, ‘sympathise[d] with Tilak
in his fall.’ [10] Ultimately, then, while the violence in Bombay was stemmed,
the affair nevertheless compounded imperial fears of an increasingly
aggressive Indian nationalism.

It was, in fact, an exhortation to force—at least as the state saw it—that

put Tilak on the wrong side of colonial law. For decades this _lokamanya_
(‘revered of the people’) had edited a bold Marathi-language weekly called
_Kesari_ . In the summer of 1908, two articles opened for the British a
window to prosecute. The first (‘The Country’s Misfortune’) appeared in
response to the killing of two white women with a bomb by revolutionaries
in Bengal. Tilak condemned the loss of life but declared in his editorial that
it was British ‘obstinacy and perversity’ that instigated young men
—‘solicitous for the advancement of their country’—to pick up bombs.
Indians sought _swarajya_ , self-government. And since the imperial power
did not acknowledge this perfectly legitimate claim, instead taking to
‘oppressive Russian methods’, the people too were ‘compelled’ to respond
in the fashion of Russian revolutionaries. The Bengal case was tragic. But,
Tilak believed, it was critical to address the core ailment—colonial rule—
rather than just its bloody rashes. [11] Incidentally, this was not the first time
the _Kesari_ had advocated aggressive ‘Russian methods of agitation’. In
1907, for example, Tilak wrote that ‘it is necessary for thousands of young
men to risk their lives’ for India; that no matter the Raj’s might, ‘the British


-----

themselves know . . . how unsound the foundation of their power . . . is’. [12]

Violent action by brown persons, while generally lamentable was not, to
him, politically inexplicable. [13]

The second article, meanwhile, had the title ‘These Remedies Are Not

Lasting’. This one argued against equating Bengal’s revolutionaries with
European anarchists, as the officialdom was wont to do. In white lands, the
editorial claimed, it was ‘hatred felt for selfish millionaires’ that galvanized
men. In Bengal, however, the root of violence was noble: ‘an excess of
patriotism’. Indians were adopting anarchist methods, yes, but it was better
to equate them with brave Russians standing up to tsarist tyranny. The
article also offered the analogy of a caged parrot. Typically, such pets were
treated with affection; they received sugar and treats to compensate for the
loss of freedom. But with India, the British had ‘not only closed the door . .
. [but also] commenced to pluck the wings and break the [bird’s] leg’. As a
nation, Indians were ‘castrated’. Was it any surprise, then, that pushed to the
limits of suffering, hot-blooded youth were seduced by the bomb? The item
itself, unlike ordinary arms, did not require big factories or assembly lines;
it could be produced easily. And if the ‘policy of repression’ continued,
more and more men would take to making explosives in their kitchens. The
only way to prevent this, the _Kesari_ counselled, was to grant Indians the
rights they demanded. Revolutionaries were ‘turnheaded’, sure, but it was
conditions of British invention that precipitated such cranial rotation. And
so, common sense demanded that to avoid more pain and gore, the state
must remedy its own behaviour. [14]

After his trial, Tilak, predictably, forfeited personal liberty but soared in

public esteem. His courtroom address—lasting, in the words of the
frustrated prosecutor a ‘maddening’ twenty-one hours [15] —did not sway the
predominantly white jury. But while the accused was no orator, his punchy
lines, trumpeted by the press, found their mark. Indeed, grumbled an
official, the whole performance ‘was made not so much to the jury as to the
gallery’. [16] At the start, Tilak decried how the entire case rested on defective
English translations of his Marathi writings. The subtext was clear: The
legal system remained laughably foreign to the subject race on which it
forced its ‘justice’. Next, citing press freedoms, he added that so long as
Indians admired fancy Western ideas quietly, things were fine. But ‘as soon
as we begin to imitate them you call it seditious’. [17] Weaving (perhaps
deliberately) an excruciatingly dilated argument about his journalism being
misunderstood, Tilak did not, however, abandon his stance. Bomb-throwing


-----

was criminal. ‘But in condemning it,’ he confirmed, ‘we must also condemn
the repressive measures of [the] Government.’ [18] It is no surprise, then, that
to the prosecution, whichever way it was viewed, Tilak’s ‘doctrine [was]
subversive’, relaying to Indians that if patriotism were the cause, even
bloodshed was admissible. [19]

When the verdict was announced, hours before his fifty-second birthday,

Bombay, as we saw, went up in flames. For a week, the British struggled,
spared further stress only by the fact that the rioting public was
disorganized and incapable of escalation. London, meanwhile, worried
about long-term repercussions: ‘mischief . . . will be done by this sentence’,
the secretary of state predicted, though it was too late to retreat; ‘the milk is
now spilled’. [20] In September, Tilak was deported to Burma where he would
stay locked up for half a decade. In 1909, when asked by a friend to accept
certain terms for an early release, he declined this ‘undoing’ of his life’s
work; to accept conditions would be to ‘live as a dead man’. [21] Instead, in a
memorial to London, he highlighted procedural flaws in his trial, branding it
‘unlawful’. [22] In subsequent petitions too, such as in 1912, while his
language mellowed, the British saw ‘neither expression of penitence nor
promise of future good behaviour’. [23] Indeed, Tilak had told an official that
on release, he planned to ‘recommence his preaching and teaching’; that ‘no
foreigner has a right to rule India’. [24] So when at last in 1914, he was set
free, having served his full term, the authorities still viewed the lokamanya
as an accredited ‘enemy of the British Government’. [25] And with good
reason: If earlier he were a rising star, now after exile he ‘appeared to his
followers as little less than the reincarnation of a deity’. [26] In fact, by 1918,
Tilak was being nervously described as ‘probably the most powerful man in
India’, [27] having even won international approbation from the likes of
Lenin. [28]

Unfortunately for the Maratha hero, age played spoilsport just as he

arrived at the peak of his influence. Tilak died in 1920, and leadership of the
nationalist movement was transferred from the lokamanya into the hands of
a certain mahatma. Gandhi had returned to India after years abroad in 1915,


-----

preaching passive resistance and nonviolence—neither of which
propositions amused Tilak. When at a gathering the new entrant piously
proposed that Indian politics should be based on truth, the veteran snorted:
‘My friend! Truth has no place in politics.’ [29] Tilak was a student of
philosophy, but in the realm of men, he championed pragmatic action. Or as
he wrote in a commentary on the sacred Gita—composed, revealingly
enough, when in prison—while saintliness had much to commend it, if
required one must not hesitate to ‘take out a thorn by a thorn’—or seek an
eye for an eye. [30] ‘Tilak . . . considers that everything is fair in politics,’
protested the mahatma, who envisioned a more idealistic public discourse
of ‘honesty, fairplay and charity’. In return, Tilak reminded Gandhi that he
was in ‘a game of worldly people and not of sadhus (saints)’. This was not
to suggest the younger man’s principles were foolish; only that between
their divergent styles ‘one is more suited to this world’. [31] Or as Tilak
simplified for a crowd in a speech some years prior, ‘There is only one
medicine for [the deliverance of] all people. That medicine is power; take it
into your possession.’ [32]

Centuries before Tilak, there lived in the Maharashtra region a Brahmin
sage called Ramdas (1608–81). He had wisdom to impart on god and
matters of the soul, but what most appealed to later-day nationalists were
his political lessons. ‘Meet boldness with boldness,’ he advised, and
‘villainy by villainy’. [33] One can see why this animated Tilak’s generation.
Indeed, in the colonial era, many in this part of India drew parallels between
their own time and the age of Ramdas. If today they were fighting British
imperialism, back then, it was Mughal power that had threatened their
ancestors. Where in the present foreigners from overseas imperilled Hindu
society, in the past, it was an invading northern empire that pressed it. The
Mughal conquest had, in fact, aggravated everything from famine to
political instability. In response—and in a tone Tilak would echo—Ramdas


-----

promoted the cult of power. ‘In this tumultuous world, what can the weak
do?’ [34] No, the ‘god-hating dogs’ must be ‘ _driven_ from the land’. He
commanded the Marathas to unite, spread their authority and bring order. [35]

Patent here, however, was also a fusing of politics with religion: The enemy
represented Islamic might, whereas resistance was Hindu—defined by
Ramdas, in tune with his own background, in an orthodox mould. [36]

But if Ramdas offered an intellectual frame for militant Hinduism, the

real icon—the man who manifested it in action—was the contemporary
Maratha king, Chhatrapati Shivaji (1630–80). In fact, claims would later be
made, to supply modern perceptions of the past a tidier wellspring, that
Ramdas was the latter’s guru: an idea dismissed by scholars who argue that
more likely, it was Shivaji’s deeds that fertilized Ramdas’s mind. [37] But
either way, the seventeenth century saw something heady surface in
Maharashtra, both intellectually and politically, generating powerful
influences for future anti-colonialists. To start with, there was plain political
resistance. By the time Shivaji was born, the old Islamic state his family
served had crumbled, [38] and the area was torn between the Mughals and a
neighbouring sultanate. Both were foreign, albeit in different degrees, and
their resultant deficit in legitimacy—added to his phenomenal daring—
allowed Shivaji to carve out an autonomous realm. [39] In 1659, the sultanate
ordered its most feared general to crush the upstart Maratha, but in a
sensational turn, Shivaji took Afzal Khan’s head. Here, we encounter the
triumph of the underdog against established might. Shivaji had till then
been dismissed as an irritating rebel, as small fry; and _yet,_ he felled the
dreaded Khan. Or as would be stated in a eulogy—and arouse men like
Tilak in the age of bombs and the Raj:

Even a single ant
Can kill an elephant

By crawling into its trunk.
So no one should consider

Any enemy too small. [40]


-----

From now, Shivaji’s career would pick up. And save for a few reversals, he
successfully founded a Maratha kingdom in the Deccan—which, in the
following century, would sweep up much of the subcontinent from Mughal
control. But kingship is more than bald power; it requires an ideological
foundation. Given that the region was governed by Muslim dynasties from
as far back as the fourteenth century, society had largely grown used to
Islamic sovereignty. Shivaji was seen as a parvenu; indeed, many leading
_Marathas_ refused to recognize him. [41] In any case, as a non-Muslim, he
could not appropriate the sultanate model, [42] so the would-be king fell back
on Hindu traditions, claiming space on fresh terms. In 1674, he organized a
grand ‘classical’ coronation rite—of the like not seen for centuries—turning
the proverbial table. [43] For from the Sanskritic perspective, it was _Islamic_
rule that was illegitimate; in this reading, Shivaji was no rebel, but an
idealized Kshatriya monarch, _restoring_ order after a long eclipse. This
countering of Islamic power structures with a Sanskritic one also
accommodated his newness. And Shivaji ceased operating on an ideological
ground set by rivals, instead reimagining the very basis of politics. Or, as a
chronicle has him proclaim: ‘My aim is to found a Maharashtra Empire.
Our religion has been overthrown, gods and Brahmans are troubled, the
_Mlechchhas_ [barbarians] are supreme.’ He would ‘remove this [improper]
state of things’. [44]

Thus, for instance, in one of the oldest Maratha ballads from this period,

we find Islamic power delegitimized by highlighting the fanaticism and
bigotry of Afzal Khan. When he is on his way to Shivaji before their fateful
meeting, he plunders and despoils major temples: proof of why, ultimately,
Islamic rule can never truly serve order in the Hindu sense. [45] In contrast,
Shivaji is positioned as an instrument of the divine—through him, it is the
gods who are at work. [46] That the region had long suffered from the decline
of the sultanates and the many-generational war with the Mughals, also
reinforced such claims. This said, Muslims as a people were not Shivaji’s
enemies: Indeed, in a court epic, a sultan is styled _dharmatma_ (saintly), and
a Muslim general who fought the Mughals in an earlier age, is likened to


-----

Hindu deities. [47] Why, Shivaji’s father himself is believed to have been
named, as mentioned in the Introduction, after a Muslim pir. [48] But as the
founder of a new _political_ entity and a consciously Hindu kingship, Islamic
_power_ was undesirable; the new space he was creating was ‘accessible to
all’, sure, but would be ‘governed by Hindus’ [49] —a development which in
due course offered Hindu nationalists a genealogy for their creed. [50] More
broadly, for Tilak’s generation, Shivaji’s example could be marshalled for
resistance to the British. The Raj called them seditious, but they denied
unwelcome foreigners the ground to call them anything at all. Just as
Shivaji refused to recognize norms set by Islamic authority in Maharashtra,
Tilak would deny the British any berth in India. [51]

This overlap between a politically alert Hinduism and nationalism was

particularly pronounced in Tilak’s early career. The Indian National
Congress—the chief colonial-era nationalist outfit, and to this day, one of
the country’s principal political parties—was established in 1885, mainly as
a body of English-educated Indians. Their idea was to agitate, most politely,
for greater representation for ‘natives’ in the country’s administration. Five
years later, Tilak—a prominent journalist, already hostile to the Raj—joined
it. [52] But from the start, he perceived the organization as too moderate, not
to speak of divorced from the masses. Yes, it was true that despite its
diplomatic tone, the Congress faced British suspicion—to assuage the latter,
its 1886 president had even to declare it India’s ‘good fortune’ to suffer the
Raj’s ‘civilizing rule’. [53] But for Tilak, a fear of imperial sensitivities was
untenable. Congress, to him, looked like an elite talking shop; to grow
fiercer, he urged a sustained outreach to ordinary people, in forms and an
idiom they could identify with. That is, if Congress hoped for better ‘native’
representation in power,
it would itself first have to better represent India’s non-English-speaking
classes. Tilak’s plan to achieve this was to moor modern political freedoms
and institutions in ‘native’ cultural ideas. And the way he would do this—to
the discomfiture of many of his peers—was by injecting religion into
nationalism. [54] Or as was argued, ‘Why shouldn’t we convert the large


-----

religious festivals into mass political rallies?’ By so doing, the cause would
escape narrow, anglicized confines for ‘the humblest cottages’. [55] And
Congress—lampooned by a British viceroy as akin to an adolescents’
debating society—would be able to answer the gibe with a bite. [56]

In other words, Tilak was, to quote an admirer, ‘trying to bring politics

from the cloudland of words and general theories to the solid earth of
reality’. [57] Instead of huffing along on British terms—submitting petitions,
seeking seats in legal bodies and councils and attempting a politics of
persuasion—Indians could, with a little effort, he felt, _force_ a better bargain.
The Congress in its moderate avatar was, he would sneer, like ‘a seasonal
activity’, comparable to ‘the croaking of frogs in the rains’. [58] So, in
Maharashtra at any rate, he began to attempt transforming those croaks into
something resembling a growl by developing festivals. His first was focused
on the elephant-headed Ganapati, venerated as much by Brahmins as by
non-Brahmins. This made the deity a compelling candidate to construct
‘harmony amongst various sections of the Hindu community’. [59] Where
individuals worshipped diverse gods in diverse ways and spaces, here was
an opportunity to combine under one umbrella, ‘with one heart and one
sense of pride’. [60] What was mostly a private worship, thus, was turned from
1893 into a public celebration. [61] Different localities—housing specific
castes—were encouraged to install a Ganapati, all these converging ten
days later in a colourful procession. By its second edition, Poona alone had
a hundred Ganapatis, with bands of musicians, acrobats, dancers and
thousands of spectators. [62] Some grumbled it was undignified to turn faith
into a spectacle. But for Tilak, ‘demonstration and éclat [were] essential to
the awakening of the masses’. [63] That is, this was not about god but kindling
public energy; fun and play was a vehicle for ‘imparting [political]
knowledge’. [64] And he was vindicated: The festival was a success. By 1905,
seventy-two towns, including a few outside the Deccan, would import the
idea of Ganapati gatherings. [65]

The second event Tilak launched was an annual commemoration of

Shivaji: a hero on whom too ‘all the different castes of Maharashtra could


-----

focus their loyalty’. [66] To begin with, the king’s _samadhi_ (memorial) in a
faraway fort languished in neglect, as the dominion of ‘kites and crows,
vultures and dogs’. [67] A decade ago, the British had allocated a maintenance
grant but hopes of raising a shrine were disappointed. Through his paper,
Tilak invited public donations and by the end of 1895, 60,000 people had
subscribed. [68] Shivaji, of course, had already been seized on by others:
Phule, who we met in the previous chapter, presented him as a peasant
leader, a man of the masses and an embodiment of justice, for instance. In
the 1870s, Vasudev Balwant Phadke (1845–83), a clerk-turned-militant
activist, had set off an armed revolt. [69] At the time, the press compared his
agenda to Shivaji’s. [70] Tilak, however, transformed the king into a totem for
mass mobilization, including by shaming his countrymen. It was, he wrote,
appalling that Maharashtra had ‘forgotten the great man who laid the
foundation of our empire, who upheld our self respect as Hindus’. [71] They
_owed_ his memory reverence. Again, there were critics who believed Shivaji
‘would not have liked’ extravagance; that no human should be ‘worshipped
like God’. [72] But Tilak would not yield: ‘hero worship’ was a key fount of
‘nationality, social order, and religion’. [73] Or as a supporter’s letter
published in the _Kesari_ explained, Shivaji was to Maharashtra ‘what
George Washington was to the United States of America’—a symbol of
who his people were, and what they must fight for. [74] And here again, Tilak
could claim a win: By 1907, brown students even as far as Tokyo were
organizing Shivaji celebrations. [75]

To nobody’s surprise, the British resented both of Tilak’s marquee

enterprises. As early as 1896, it was observed that the objective of the
Shivaji festival ‘is obviously to arouse if it exists or create, if it does not, a
nationalist feeling among the Mahrattas’. [76] A decade later, it was even
clearer that Ganapati celebrations served as an ‘occasion of demonstrations
against the British’ while the ‘cult of Shivaji’ was ‘an incitement to the
expulsion of English rule’. [77] In the Marathi press, it was freely proclaimed
how, as Shivaji delivered Maharashtra from Mughal oppression, rebuilding
the samadhi would ‘rouse the spirit of a future patriot to restore
independence to his country.’ [78] ‘Shivaji’s present popularity,’ another
journal explained, was predicated on the ‘supposition that the Indians of the
present day are suffering from the same evils . . . as their ancestors suffered
in the times of Shivaji’. [79] At the festivals itself, poets paraded zeal to stir up
their audience, comprising everyone from peasants and teachers to
shopkeepers. ‘Fools, what is the use of your being men?’ asked one. ‘Of
what use are your big moustaches?’ India was ‘called _Hindu_ stan’; ‘[h]ow is
it that the English rule here?’ Describing the British as cow-killing butchers,
listeners were told to not fear ‘slaughtering the wicked’. [80] The mood was
electric and inspired all kinds of markets—the society artist Raja Ravi
Varma, for example, had an instant hit on his hands when he mass-produced
prints of Shivaji’s portrait. [81] The king, from a faceless outline in traditional
tales, made his entry into thousands of Maharashtra homes this way,
enveloped in history but also political sentiment.

These events, in fact, resulted in Tilak’s first encounter with anti-sedition

laws. In 1897, the Shivaji festival was pointedly arranged ten days before
Queen Victoria’s jubilee. [82] And speeches made on the occasion looked to
the Raj like pure incitement. One figure endorsed the use of every option in
regaining ‘lost independence’; a second referenced the French Revolution,
adding how committing murder in service of an ideal was justified, a
principle that ‘applied to Maharashtra’. [83] Another topic covered was
Shivaji’s killing of Afzal Khan at what was formally a diplomatic meeting
between the two. There was a debate as to who struck first and was liable,


-----

therefore, to the charge of treachery. [84] One speaker argued that even if
Shivaji were guilty, it was fine; the Maratha hero abandoned ‘a minor duty’
for ‘accomplishing a major one’. [85] Tilak went further. ‘If thieves enter our
house and we have not sufficient strength to drive them out, we should
without hesitation shut them up and burn them alive.’ That is, morality was
contingent on context; Shivaji killed out of higher motives. Finally, Tilak
thundered: ‘God has not conferred upon the foreigners the grant inscribed
on a copper-plate of the Kingdom of Hindusthan.’ Urging all to ‘consider
the actions of great men’ in conceiving resistance, he called on them to
escape the shackles of mere legality. For this, the Gita was pointed to—that
religious text of orientalist delight, where a central figure from the
Mahabharata, facing cousins and loved ones on the opposite side of the
battlefield, is counselled by the divine Krishna to cast aside his scruples and
do his duty. [86] It was difficult, and would not pass elementary moral exams,
but what needed to be done had to be done. [87] Or in more contemporary
language: no gain without pain.

This might all have passed for strong rhetoric, were it not for the fact that

days later, two men enacted these lessons. W.C. Rand, an officer notorious
for a rather harsh policy during a recent epidemic—and castigated in print
by Tilak as ‘sullen and tyrannical’ [88] —was shot dead. The brothers Damodar
and Balakrishna Chapekar were responsible. These men had for long flirted
with violence, having until recently run a crew trained in martial skills.
Claiming inspiration from the Gita, Shivaji and Americans, they harassed
missionaries and even defaced in Bombay a statue of that ‘fiend’,
Victoria. [89] In their mind, everything British was suspect, whether it was

90
English education (which sneakily made brown men effeminate and antiHindu) or cricket. ‘Native’ reformers were reviled with a passion: the
Chapekars once assaulted with a metal pipe (from behind, it might be
noted) the editor of a progressive journal. [91] To them, even Tilak was not
bold enough, though he was ‘better’ than the Congress’s moderates. [92] For
his part, while the lokamanya knew the brothers—having recommended
one for a job the previous year [93] —whether he was embroiled in Rand’s


-----

murder is debatable. [94] A paper that suggested this had to apologize, for
example. [95] But the British certainly held Tilak morally accountable. In
1897, in what was described in the ‘native’ press as a ‘national calamity’, he
was jailed, spending twelve months behind bars. [96] The Chapekars, in the
meantime, were hanged. [97] Tellingly, in Damodar’s final hours, it was
Tilak’s copy of the Gita that kept him company. [98]

In fact, decades later, officials remained part-amused and part-flummoxed

that the man, who through ‘grandiose phrases’ stressed direct action,
showed horror when ‘misguided students’ actually did what he preached. [99]

In the government’s eyes, he was likely ‘the chief conspirator, against the
existence of the British’ in India. [100] They could never find convincing
proof, though, of Tilak’s links to revolutionaries: Indeed, after the 1908
sedition case, one dejected bureaucrat complained how the man might have
been neutralized, ‘[h]ad we been able to connect Tilak with the bomb or
gun running business even indirectly’. [101] But that he was a formidable
symbol was obvious. In Kolhapur, thus, a school was founded with hopes of
producing boys ‘of the stamp of Tilak’. [102] In 1909, when another British
officer was killed in Nasik, the assassin admitted that the _Kesari_ had
influenced his thinking. [103] A fellow conspirator was an organizer of the
city’s Shivaji festival. [104] The next year, in a sedition case in faraway
Punjab, several accused were apprehended carrying images of Tilak. [105]

Why, when that Pandharpur missionary was attacked after his own
conviction in 1908, it was to shouts of ‘Shivaji ki Jai’ (‘Victory to Shivaji’)
and ‘Tilak Maharaj ki Jai’ (‘Victory to Tilak’). [106] The closest the authorities
came to pinning the lokamanya was when a revolutionary, Hoti Lal Verma,
claimed Tilak aided him with money and an introduction to men ‘who knew
how to make bombs’. [107] But there was no clinching proof—at any rate, by
then this ‘Father of Indian Unrest’ was already incarcerated, serving out his
second sentence in Burma. [108]

There are, however, complications to this tale of audacious courage.

India, it was manifest—with its variety of identities, castes and languages—
could never be a case study in homogeneity. How then to foster


-----

nationalism? Where Tilak was concerned, the solution lay in tethering the
proposition to Hinduism; to cultivate a _Hindu_ nationalism. Moderate
Congressmen’s views that everyone living in India was automatically part
of an Indian nation was not convincing. Or as he explained, to view
‘Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Parsis’ and others as a unity was wrong; to claim
‘their nationality has become one’ was simplistic. [109] No mere ‘aggregation
of people’ residing together constituted ‘a nation’. For the genuine article
one needed ‘such bonds as a common language, a common religion, and a
common history’. [110] The harsh truth to be faced, then, was that the
‘majority of our society’ was Hindu. And though internally diverse, Hindus
all shared a palpable ‘feeling of _Hindutva_ (Hinduness)’. [111] This, therefore,
must be the glue with which to activate nationalism. The Victorian tenet
was that India was a dispersed ‘assemblage of beings’. [112] But for Tilak, the
great bulk of those beings converged under that great tent called Hinduism.
By ‘forgetting all the minor differences’, it would be possible to secure
them into a ‘mighty Hindu nation’. [113] And naturally, ‘the prosperity which
we want must come about by means of a Hindu state’. [114] After all, as Tilak
explained, the very name ‘Hindustan’ for India originated in the fact that
this was the Hindu homeland. Contradictions within did not matter; ‘pride
in the Hindu religion’ could convert most Indians into a forceful bloc. [115]

To frame this Hindu nationalism, however, Hinduism needed a clearer

shape. Who exactly was Hindu? To begin with, internal caste and other
differences were no impediment; as Tilak argued, among Christians too
there were Protestants and Catholics. There might even be sectarian
persecution, and yet, they were of one religion. [116] So too, Hinduism was
‘made up of different parts co-related to each other as so many sons and
daughters’; and all families had their squabbles. [117] In fact, to count as
Hindu, one had to satisfy only a few requirements: acknowledge Vedic
supremacy; accept that there are multiple paths to god; and that god did not
open only one door to mankind through a single prophet or messenger but
appeared in a host of forms. [118] It is striking how much of this matched what
Hindus had always stated in their encounters with missionaries like


-----

Ziegenbalg. But Tilak’s articulation that different peoples worshipped god
in different ways was tailored also to accommodate Hinduism’s _domestic_
variety. [119] Interestingly, he did not romanticize Vedic revivalism of the Arya
Samaj type; in fact, wrote the lokamanya, Hinduism had survived the ages
precisely by being open to change, sometimes even incorporating features
from rival traditions. [120] For this reason, he declared himself a friend of
reform, subject however to the condition that it uphold Hindutva. Luther
was offered as a model—the German called for transformation, yes, but
remained a devout Christian. ‘Native’ Luthers too, then, were legitimate
only if they worked within the limits of Hindu nationalist interests. [121]

Viewed this way, one can recognize why Tilak was no champion of radicals
like Phule, excoriating as they did Hinduism from top to bottom, in a
missionary tone. [122]

That said, Tilak’s Hindutva or Hinduness was largely still an academic

portrait. As late as 1911, for instance, in swathes of upper India, census
officials would find that ‘a quarter of the persons classed as Hindus denied’
both ‘supremacy of the brahmans and the authority of the Vedas’. Even with
cow worship, two-fifths ate beef. [123] So in terms of _practical_ mobilization,
Hinduness was reinforced by emphasizing not what Hindus were but what
they were _not_ : Christian and Muslim. [124] Where the Congress’s moderates
framed nationalism as political resistance, for Tilak it also involved
addressing a cultural collision. In a 1901 article (‘Wake Up or Die’), he
declared, for instance, how modern science had shattered Christianity’s
claims; yet thanks to financial might and the fact of the British empire,
missionaries had mushroomed even in India’s villages. Charitable aid
during calamities too was suspect. In the last drought, claimed Tilak,
American donations alleviated pain but also helped missionaries amass for
potential conversion 25,000 orphans. When ‘this money is used to destroy
our religion, how can we not object?’ [125] Pandita Ramabai (1858–1922), a
Brahmin female convert (and Sanskrit scholar), was similarly targeted for
evangelical work; in a crude offensive, Tilak recommended she discard
_pandita_ (feminine for pandit) and restyle herself _reveranda_ : a play on


-----

‘reverend’ which evidently also punned in Marathi on ‘randa’, or whore. [126]

Anti-Christian feeling entered Tilak’s political speeches too. Hindus, he
protested in 1907, were suspect even when they aired basic criticism of the
Raj; missionaries, though, held full freedom of speech to attack Hinduism at
its most sacred sites. [127]

But that was not all. Besides Christianity, the Hindu nation was also

besieged by Islam. At one level, it appears that the conservative Brahmin in
Tilak was not fond of interfaith overlaps—what looked happily syncretic
from one gaze resembled adulteration from another. Muharram in
Maharashtra, for instance, drew enthusiastic Hindu engagement—the latter
made vows and even joined in processions. [128] While moderate politicians
were charmed by this display of interreligious harmony, [129] as early as 1891,
Tilak dismissed the festival. [130] In 1893, after Hindu–Muslim riots in the
province—linked to cow-protection societies inspired by the Arya Samaj—
Tilak went further. [131] In the _Mahratta_ , his English paper, Bombay’s chief
mosque was construed as a nest of goons. [132] Citing Maratha opposition to
Islamic kingdoms, another piece warned how ‘the people’ had ‘sufficient
capacity and intelligence to _make the Mahomedans_ respect [their] rights’. [133]

Patent here is the idea that Hindus were ‘the people’; others might be
tolerated, provided they accepted Hindu priority. In fact, one supposed
motivation for the Ganapati festivities—in addition to organising against
the British—was Tilak’s determination to ‘supplant the Mohurram’; of
making a demonstration of Hindus’ Hinduness. [134] And though he denied
this charge of one-upmanship, Tilak could not help but add that Hindu
presence in Muharram was ‘because _we_ saw God in all beings’. But _they_ ,
Muslims, took this for granted. [135] In 1894, in fact, our man struggled to
disguise his delight when reporting that if most Muharram _doli_ s
(palanquins) were hitherto offered by Hindus—100 of 150—the number
had now dropped to twenty-five. [136] Hindus were owning their separateness,
and openly too. [137]

Indeed, at its core the tension was this: Though Hindus were numerically

stronger, a history of Islamic rule, combined with Hinduism’s many-faced,


-----

flexible and splintered nature evidently gave Islamic culture a wide berth.
Muslims, with their history of power and status, seemed to Tilak and his
compatriots, as wielding disproportionate influence, especially when they
were—as British censuses revealed—a minority of the population. How,
then, could they pretend to equal claims with Hindus? Indeed, the British
‘under the guise of religious tolerance were failing to keep the Mussalmans
in check’; secretly the Raj _favoured_ Muslims, he insisted. [138] As a result,
flexing Hinduness became critical, while highlighting the fundamental
irreconcilability of the Islamic and Hindu identities. During the Ganapati
celebrations, for example, quarrels recurred about processions playing
music near mosques, offending Muslims. In 1894, thus, the magistrate in
Poona decreed that ‘music must cease’ in such spaces. Tilak, however,
argued that the ‘streets are public’ and that all enjoyed ‘equal rights . . . to
use any street—both silently and otherwise’. [139] One official later alleged
that personally, Tilak did not ‘regard the right to play music as important’.
But he shrewdly identified in it an occasion for Hindu assertion; a platform
for castes to identify with that broad heading of _being Hindu_ against a rival
Other. So, it was ‘not that Tilak adopted a particular method but that he
aimed at a particular result’. [140] And the goal in mind was Hindu
consolidation—step one towards Hindu nationalism.

This comes through in the Ganapati songs also. One, seeking to wean

Hindus off Muharram, goes:

Oh! why have you abandoned today the Hindu religion?
How have you forgotten Ganapati, Shiva and Maruti?

What have you gained by worshipping the _tabuts_ [during Muharram]?
What boon has Allah conferred upon you

That you have become Mussalmans today?
Do not be friendly to a religion which is alien

Do not give up your religion and be fallen.
Do not at all venerate the _tabuts_ ,

The cow is our mother, do not forget her. [141]


-----

Moreover, as with Christianity, in criticizing the British, dislike of Islam too
slipped into Tilak’s rhetoric. Referring to the Raj’s demilitarizing of India,
he complained, for example, how ‘even a savage race like the
Muhammadans did not disarm the Hindus’. [142] In an 1895 letter in the
_Kesari_ , we read: ‘Would [Shivaji] not have burned with indignation at
seeing Hindu temples demolished by Moslem fanatics?’ [143] Other
newspapers picked up this trend, comparing British rule with ‘fanatical
persecution’ under Islamic powers. [144] Or in a critic’s words, Tilak ‘grafted a
new hatred of British rule on to the old hatred of Mohammedan
domination’. [145] In time, Hindu nationalists would expand this approach, so
that in addition to foreign foes, Hindus were asked to beware of the
(supposed) enemy within. Even with Shivaji—who could be positioned as
more than just a parochial Hindu icon—Muslims were uncomfortable.
Festival processions, for example, featured idols of Shivaji’s favourite
goddess Bhavani; Hinduness was conspicuous. [146] Tilak did not deny that
‘the country can prosper only if Hindus and Muslims get along.’ [147] There
had, he also agreed, been good men like Akbar, and plenty of examples
where Muslims patronized Hindus and vice
versa. [148] But this did not erase the basic truth that from the first Islamic
raids into the land nearly a thousand years ago, Hindus had suffered much
torment from Muslims. [149] Indeed, Hindus had well before the British
arrived, begun to resist; after all, Tilak observed, by the eighteenth century,
the Marathas were masters of India. It was by defeating _them_ —not the
Mughals—that the Raj embedded itself. [150] The underlying message was
this: If India were seized from Hindus, its proprietorship must also return in
time to Hindus exclusively. [151]

Not long before his death in August 1920, in one of his final public
speeches, Tilak was shocked by a physical assault. He was offering his


-----

opinion on whether compulsory primary education ought to be mandated
only for boys or also for girls. The lokamanya’s view was that, given poor
resources, the focus should be on boys. [152] On the face of it, he was being
pragmatic, but in fact, his position on social reform around women’s rights
had been consistently negative for decades. In 1886, for instance, he
quipped how ‘it was not with the help of girls who went to school’ that
Shivaji founded the Maratha state. [153] Five years later, he was among
opponents of a bill upping the age of consummation of marriage for girls
from ten to twelve. Progressive Hindus saw in this an urgent step in
combating child marriage; an 1889 case where a ten-year-old died after
intercourse with a husband of thirty, had shocked public opinion. Tilak,
however, argued that a ‘few examples’ were being exaggerated to condemn
Hindus; to accept British legislation would do violence to ‘our
traditions’. [154] He did not disagree that early consummation was unhealthy;
British interference, however, was worse. When the bill passed anyway, an
irate Tilak declared it ‘an attack on our national character’; Hindus who
enabled it were ‘enemies’ of their own. [155] Indeed, he compared the
government’s action to ‘Muhamadans [who] forced the Hindus to grow
beards’, i.e., forced conversion on them. [156] Back then, however, he was a
rising star. In 1920, on the other hand, the crowd’s mood was shifting. Even
as the lokamanya laid out his position, on his home turf in Poona no less,
‘tomatoes and eggs’ were hurled, and he was ‘driven off the stage’. [157]

It is something of an irony. At a pan-Indian level, Tilak had in fact

mellowed over the years, gaining wider acceptability. That is, as he
graduated from provincial celebrity to subcontinental fame, the man went
from being a polarizing politician to projecting a statesmanlike image. His
desire to energize Hindus remained, but in the fight against the British,
Muslim cooperation, he realized, was unavoidable. So, Shivaji’s appeal was
expanded: Just as Nelson and Napoleon were heroes to the British and
French nations, Tilak explained, Shivaji stood for _all_ Indians. [158] Indeed, the
Maratha king never hated Muslims; what he fought was ‘tyrannical power’,
which _happened_ in his lifetime to be Islamic. [159] In 1916, thus, he dismissed


-----

Muslim fears about a Hindu-dominated future. Stressing a shared Indian
identity, he argued that if in Canada, with its French and English factions,
an arrangement could be found, there was no reason why Muslims and
Hindus could not manage in India. If Hindus won power, they would
‘afterwards duly consult our Muhammadan brethren’. [160] Tilak was prepared
to recognize all who exerted themselves for ‘the good of India’ as ‘not
alien’. Hindus were intrinsically Indian, of course, yet ‘I don’t call
Muhammedans aliens’ either. [161] Increasingly, in fact, the lokamanya looked
rather moderate. [162] This is amusing given how his backers once attacked a
liberal as ‘the dirt of the gutter’ and a ‘eunuch’. [163] Tilak himself had
previously decried moderation as ‘unmanly’. [164] But to borrow from one of
his lawyers, if he was ‘communalistic’ once, with experience Tilak acquired
a ‘greater National outlook’. [165] He had begun an inveterate Hindu
nationalist but necessity blunted his sharp edges.

However, with social reform, his position was less elastic: The Hindu

religion and _rashtra_ (nation) were ‘more important than


-----

social reforms’. [166] And here—especially when it came to questions of caste
inequality—Hindutva looked fragile. Tilak was always alert to the risk of
caste scuttling Hindu consolidation. [167] It was all effective to point to
enemies at the door, but what of the fact that the house too was divided? For
example, tension between Brahmins and non-Brahmins, so powerfully
exemplified by Phule. [168] One point of friction was Brahmin domination of
the bureaucratic job market. As we saw, Brahmins had emerged across India
as suppliers of administrative talent. Even the British were served by
legions of twice-born clerks, [*] so that despite being a minority among
Hindus, Brahmins wielded extraordinary clout. In 1888, thus, in provinces
attached to Madras and Bombay, out of 625 senior posts, 413 were with
Brahmins. If in these parts they constituted less than 5 per cent of Hindu
males, they yet controlled not less than 60 per cent of offices. As nonBrahmins demanded a share, Brahmins felt threatened. Or as Tilak once [169]
sarcastically asked in response, did non-Brahmins intend ‘to handle the
plough or hold the grocer’s . . . scales in the Legislative Councils’? [170]

Where, as a nationalist, he would urge Indians to refuse service in the
British army until given parity with white soldiers, [171] as a Brahmin he was
incandescent with the recruitment of ‘untouchable’ Dalits. Higher castes
were the ‘soul of the nation’; ‘[w]hat use are Mahars and Berads in the
army? Their vocation is thieving.’ [172] That is, in equations _between_ Hindus,
the lokamanya’s calls for equality appeared to go on vacation. Here, every
now and then, a jealous Brahminness eclipsed his grand project of
Hinduness. [173]

So even as Tilak rose to influence in India at large, in Maharashtra itself,

non-Brahmin leaders viewed Tilakite nationalism with suspicion. Indeed,
some of Phule’s followers decried the anti-British movement itself as a ruse
for Brahmins to replace white men as rulers. One violent 1920s tract would,
in talking of ‘Brahmin imperialism’, even malign Tilak as a ‘preceptor of
dogs’. [174] Yet, these caste tensions were not invented. As far back as a
century ago, the British had noted Brahmin contempt for non-Brahmins; the
former evidently thought the latter ‘little better than monkies’ (sic) when it

came to literate vocations. [175] There was an air, quite pronounced in the
region, where Brahmins had been a ruling class under the Peshwas, that
_they_ were society’s most natural leaders. And the British too felt paranoia
on this point. In 1879, the governor of Bombay warned, for instance, how
local Brahmins ‘esteem it their charter’ to ‘rule over the minds of Hindoos’.
As the Peshwas demolished Mughal authority, this class was certain ‘the
British [too] shall be made to retire’; ‘never have I known in India,’ he
added, ‘a national and political ambition, so continuous, so enduring, so far
reaching’. [176] It sounded alarmist, but the feeling lingered: Thirty years later,
it was said again that of ‘known enemies of Government’ in the region, 80
per cent were Brahmins. [177] In leading political resistance too, whether it
was Tilak on the more pugilistic side, or figures in the Congress’s moderate
wing, Brahmins were at the forefront in Maharashtra. [178] By 1910, in fact,
the Bombay government would diversify its hiring practices to avoid
overreliance on this set. For with the rise of Brahmin-designed nationalism,
the Raj, it was feared, could no longer safely count on this class’s loyal
service. [179]

Tilak’s first instinct was to deny the problem. Brahmin and non-Brahmin

were fake categories to him: a sleight of hand to impede Hindu integration.
To some extent, he had a point. In Maharashtra alone, Brahmins were
hardly a unity: Under the Peshwas, it was a sub-caste called Chitpavans
who profited from official patronage, while others like the Deshasthas
resented them. [180] In any case, even if Brahmins controlled desk jobs, he
argued, the military, land, trade, etc. were governed by others. But ‘nonBrahmin’ was equally spurious a label: It included farmers, Dalits, potters, [181]
landowners and all manner of peoples, from all kinds of castes which had
their own rivalries. [182] In making a dislike of Brahmins their sole uniting
principle, non-Brahmin leaders were succumbing to British machinations,
letting the colonial state divide and prevail. In the south, for instance, there
were even men who believed that ‘Indian Brahmins are more alien to us’
than whites; that only the Raj could ‘hold the scales even between creed and
class’. [183] This vexed the lokamanya: The British often justified their rule


-----

with the claim that Indians were like squabbling children; that if they left,
India would sink into disorder. And here were brown men bolstering this
position. [184] It was, at its core, a betrayal. Additionally, to suggest that caste
must vanish and that social reform should precede political independence
was, for Tilak, a suicidal view. After all, no inequities of Indian magnitude
afflicted Ireland—but did the British leave the Irish alone? [185] India, in other
words, could not wait for a perfect time—where women went to school and
low castes were emancipated—to boot out the Raj. And the more Hindus
argued among themselves, the less likely was the prospect of freedom for
them all.

Non-Brahmin leaders, however, inverted the argument, asking: freedom

for whom and what? Sayajirao Gaekwad III (1863–1939), the maharajah of
Baroda, was a nationalist, for example. [186] But he disagreed with Tilak on
reform. In his view, ‘[n]ational advancement _includes_ social progress.’ [187]

To suggest that India must first obtain freedom, and that inconvenient topics
like caste ought to be shelved till then was rubbish. True patriotism, lay in
protecting ‘with might’ all that was of value but also in discarding
‘unhesitatingly’ elements of decay. [188] The point of political independence
was not to go back to a pre-British age of social inequality or leave the
structures of power within Hindu society untouched by modernity. Tilak
clashed also with the Kolhapur maharajah, descended from Shivaji. It began
with a feud over ritual: Brahmins had denied the prince Vedic rites
(permitted to Kshatriyas), admitting only lower Puranic options (open to
women and Sudras). [189] Shahu II (1874–1922) saw this as an affront. [190] And
for all his talk of uniting Hindus, Tilak sided with the mulish orthodox


-----

party. [191] Where the lokamanya wished the ruler to ‘take a proper pride in
Hindutwa’, [192] Shahu, tepid even to Tilak’s effort to renovate his ancestor’s
samadhi, [193] saw this programme as Brahmin-oriented. So instead, he
responded by clipping Brahmin influence: From 1902, half of all
government appointments in Kolhapur were reserved for non-Brahmins. [194]

In Baroda, Sayajirao—who too was denied Kshatriya rank—enacted similar
measures. [195] It was a stance that made the loudest (Brahmin) promoters of
Hindu unity restless. To critics, though, it seemed like Hindu
consolidationists wanted nationalism, but without surrendering caste
prerogatives. [196] Hindus must resist Muslims and Christians as a bloc; but
_intra_ -Hindu dissonances were (conveniently) to be tucked away. [197] It was
in this context that Tilak was assaulted with eggs and vegetables.

In the immediate aftermath of the lokamanya’s death, then, it looked like

Hindutva was coming apart. Indeed, non-Brahmin radicals turned Tilak’s
playbook against him. By the middle of the new decade, they too organized
festivals, with the difference that images of Phule and Shahu were paraded
alongside Shivaji’s. Clashes occurred, not between Muslims and Hindus; it
was the non-Brahmin at the conservative Brahmin’s throat. Songs,
meanwhile, were sung of Brahmin treachery; of why Hindu interests were
_not_ identical to narrow Brahmin interests. [198] And where Tilak promoted a
monolithic division between Hindus and Muslims, these leaders
manufactured a rigid boundary between non-Brahmins and Brahmins. The
issue was frothing up elsewhere too. In Mysore, when its maharajah
proposed to counter Brahmin dominance in his civil services, his premier
resigned. [199] In Madras, one critic had years before sneered that if the
British reigned in India, ‘the Brahman rules it’. [200] Another leader, E.V.
Ramaswami Naicker (1879–1973), would sourly state: ‘If you have to
choose between killing a Brahmin or a snake, spare the snake.’ [201] So much
so that in the early 1930s, the _Kesari_ ’s editor warned that Brahmins, who
had contributed so much to the anti-colonial movement, would be
compelled to exit the battle, the implication being this would injure the
national cause. [202] But the broader point—which disturbs Hindu nationalism


-----

to this day—remained: that seams of Hindu unity, loose to begin with,
risked coming undone in the face of domestic caste dissension.

Tilak need not have worried, though. For despite all this public warring

—between the ideas of secular nationalism and Hindu majoritarianism,
Brahmins and non-Brahmins—the pursuit of Hinduness sustained itself.
Indeed, Tilak’s opponents appropriated this concept too, just as they took
his strategies of mobilization. A leading non-Brahmin, thus, called on
Hindus to ‘protect our Hindutva’ and work for a ‘Hindu Empire’; he
rejected Brahminism, yes, but saw the broader Hindu label as valid. [203]

Phule too—accused not too long ago of a Christian slant—was reincarnated
in non-Brahmin propaganda as a _Hindu_ hero; he had, it was now claimed,
rescued Hinduism from Brahminism. [204] Missionaries branded Brahmins
peddlers of an evil priestcraft; that argument was deployed now by nonBrahmins to rally all the _other_ castes _as Hindus_ , under _their_ leadership.
Naturally, this Hindutva was unlike Tilak’s. Writing in 1891, the latter
declared caste ‘the basis of the Hindu nation’. [205] Hindus had to rise above
diversity to forge nationalism, but their essential variety was not, to him,
illegitimate. Thus, a Brahmin would always remain a Brahmin, and other
castes in their prescribed slots—and like parts of a machine they would
combine to address common threats. The 1920s non-Brahmins accepted
only one category, though: that of Hindus without distinctions. To be part of
the Hindu nation, they argued—marrying Phule’s anti-casteism with
Tilakite cultural nationalism—caste must be rejected and equality
embraced. Hinduness could not be trotted in and out selectively; it must
demolish internal biases as vigorously as it fought external foes. Brahmins
were welcome to participate, of course, but after renouncing caste. Or as a
polemicist declared: ‘Reject the Brahmin who sees himself as a Brahmin;
accept only he who merges with the rest of us _as a Hindu_ .’ [206]

Despite debate and disagreements, that is, Hinduness—Hindutva—was

here to stay. And not long after Tilak exited the stage, it would acquire its
greatest, most formidable exponent.

A little after 6.30 on the morning of 8 July 1910, a young man plunged into
French waters at Marseilles. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar (1883–1966) was a
prisoner onboard the SS _Morea_ , on his way to standing trial in India. With
two ‘native constables’ waiting just outside, he had gone into the toilet to
accomplish his morning business. Until he quickly shot the door bolt and


-----

propelled himself to personal liberty via a porthole. Years later, stories
would be told of bullets zipping around his head during this bold escape.
Some said Savarkar swam for days to reach land and get ashore. [207] In fact,
however, it took barely a few minutes before he was on the quay. The
prisoner was quickly apprehended too, though the details are sketchy. A
French gendarme said he chased Savarkar for ‘about 400 metres’ before
catching up; and then walked another ten to hand him to the puffing
constables. The latter, however, reported that the Frenchman had appeared
from the left just as they were closing in from the right, and that moments
after the gendarme gripped the escapee, they took over. All along, Savarkar,
hoping to seek political asylum, pleaded with the French officer to transfer
him to local authorities. Unfortunately, his detainer did not understand
anything he was saying, and the prisoner was marched back to his ship—
and to the bleak prospects of a windowless cabin.

Causing a nuisance to his captors, though, Savarkar’s thwarted escape

became an international controversy. Or as the French ambassador in
London argued, ‘As the prisoner had reached French soil . . . questions of
international law were involved.’ [208] That is, from the moment he got out of
the water, his British–Indian keepers no longer enjoyed legal rights to
pursue, arrest or cart him back to a foreign vessel. And till this question of
jurisdiction were settled, Savarkar should not, it was demanded, be tried. In
Britain, these French assertions prompted irritation, but they did seem to
hold water. The home secretary—one Winston Churchill—agreed that
London must submit ‘to the law of nations’, even if this entailed the ‘petty
annoyance of a criminal escaping’ justice. [209] But his India colleagues were
indignant: Savarkar was accused of waging war against the king-emperor,
abetment to murder, sedition and worse. He was the ‘head of a widespread
conspiracy’ that threatened British rule in the subcontinent—and must not,
therefore, be handed freedom, gift-wrapped in technicalities. [210] Besides, the
French had been informed in advance of Savarkar’s passing through
Marseilles, even providing additional security; it was this very arrangement
that prevented his escape. But Paris would not budge, so in October, the


-----

matter was transferred to The Hague for arbitration. And here, Britain’s
view prevailed. [211] International law would not save this future face of
Hindu nationalism.

Savarkar was born the second of four children into a (Chitpavan)

Brahmin family not far from Nasik. Though they still owned a good stretch
of land, their inherited memories were of lost greatness from the age of the
Peshwas, when their ancestors led troops and lorded about in mansions. [212]

As a boy, Savarkar studied in one of India’s new, and keenly sought-after,
English schools, while also, through his father, picking up traditional
education in Sanskrit and Marathi. He was precocious, wilful and
intelligent, and into adolescence, began soaking in ideas from the
nationalist press, including Tilak’s _Kesari_ . But there were jolts too: When


-----

he was nine, his mother died, and by his teens, his father followed,
succumbing to the plague of the 1890s. [213] In the same phase, Savarkar grew
more radical. Towards the end of his days, he would recall how the
execution of the Chapekars—who killed that British officer in Poona in
1897—‘stirred’ him. [214] In a poem written around then we read: ‘That you
left your work undone, do not be upset. Further we will take your work.’ [215]

Indeed, early on, the British too noted how Savarkar was a ‘firebrand’ who
held ‘somewhat the same opinion’ as the Chapekars. [216] A professor of his
would similarly worry that while his ‘patriotism was intense’, it could do
with an infusion of ‘cold reason’. [217] In Nasik, thus, Savarkar had
participated with enthusiasm in the Shivaji and Ganapati festivals, clashing
with Muslim boys at school, and once vandalizing a mosque. [218] And by the
age of twenty-two, the government would ban two ballads he composed on
Shivaji, which were ‘on everyone’s lips’ around his home town. [219]

By now in Poona for higher studies, Savarkar had enrolled in Fergusson

College, of which Tilak was a founder. [220] Here, he began giving speeches,
assisting the lokamanya in political activities (such as orchestrating a
bonfire of British goods during a protest) and set up a secret society called
Abhinav Bharat. [221] It was a loose network of aspiring revolutionaries—
including one of Tilak’s sons—whose goals broadly coincided, even if most
of them lived diffused across Maharashtra. Thanks to this, while still at
university, the colonial government began surveilling Savarkar. His
nearness to Tilak—to whom he would soon dedicate his first book [222] —was
reason enough, as was the lokamanya’s interest in the boy. Tilak, in fact,
helped Savarkar move to London next. An acquaintance, Shyamji Krishna
Varma (1857–1930)—member of Dayananda’s Arya Samaj, ex-minister to
various rajahs, a man of means, a Sanskritist and, significantly, a patron of
militant nationalism—had established scholarships for Indians to study
abroad. One of these, named fittingly enough after Shivaji, was awarded to
Savarkar; in recommending him for it, Tilak portrayed his disciple as a
‘spirited young man’, ‘very enthusiastic’ in the nationalist cause. [223] Of
course, when in 1906 Savarkar set sail for England, his declared intention


-----

was to train as a barrister. As it happened in the end though, he was never
admitted to the bar; indeed, his advocacy of anti-colonial violence meant
that even his earlier Indian degree would presently be nullified. [224]

Only four years after departure from Bombay—where he left a young

wife and child—Savarkar landed in jail. It was not inevitable. At first, his
nationalism in London seemed to wear a more intellectual garb: Between
1906 and 1910, ‘he completed three books, a number of newspaper articles,
a series of essays, and [several] newsletters’. [225] In fact, within weeks of
arrival, he had translated into Marathi a set of Giuseppe Mazzini’s writings,
seeing in the Italian revolutionary the same impulses that had animated
Ramdas. [226] Interestingly, Mazzini had for long attracted Indian minds,
including Gandhi’s. [227] But given Savarkar’s reputation, his book was
banned at once for preaching ‘sedition under the guise of teaching historical
lessons’. [228] Undeterred, he launched a new project: a revisionist tome on
the Great Rebellion of 1857, published in 1909. Already in a pamphlet,
Savarkar had presented that eruption not as a mutiny—a formulation
preferred by the British—but as a war of independence. ‘We take up your
cry, we revere your flag, we are determined to continue that fiery mission’,
he wrote, pledging that in ten years, India would ‘avenge’ its martyrs’
blood. [229] His book was an amplification of this theme, with the British
seeing in it ‘the grossest perversion of facts’ and a ‘savage hatred’ for white
rule. [230] So, again, his work was banned, this time before publication. But
proscription was ineffective: Savarkar’s latest was smuggled into India, via
Europe, disguised amusingly in some cases as the Bible. [231] Jawaharlal
Nehru—the country’s future prime minister—thought it a ‘brilliant’ text,
marred only by ‘prolixity’ and some ‘want of balance’. [232]

But even as he articulated his own form of Tilakite nationalism in print,

Savarkar was also more actively following in the wake of the Chapekars. [233]

In London, he lived at India House—a club-cum-hostel set up by Varma
and described by British intelligence as an ‘anarchical society’. [234] When
Varma departed for Paris, fearing prosecution for his anti-British operations,
our barrister-in-training became its ‘presiding deity’, [235] hereafter also


-----

‘tailed nonstop’ by the police. [236] The place was not for the meek or
guarded, however: When a younger (vegetarian) Gandhi visited and showed
reluctance to partake of animal food, Savarkar snorted, ‘[T]his is just boiled
fish . . . we want people who are ready to eat the British alive.’ [237] It was the
prelude to a titanic clash, of men and ideas both, ending in the mahatma’s
murder by Savarkar’s followers in 1948. Guns too soon appeared at India
House. In 1909, a man called Madanlal Dhingra (1883–1909), described as
one of Savarkar’s ‘closest aides’, and supposedly in his thraldom, shot dead
a British official who had been part of the political department at home. [238]

In court, he declared: ‘[I]f it is patriotic in an Englishman to fight against
the Germans if they were to occupy this country,’ it was ‘patriotic in my
case to fight against the English’. [239] Gandhi proclaimed the act cowardly;
Dhingra was intoxicated by hopeless ideas and equally ‘worthless
writings’. [240] The teachings of Savarkar—who made a pilgrimage to his
friend before he was hanged—were, in Gandhi’s opinion, ‘injurious’ to true
nationalism. [241] Savarkar, however, upheld Tilak’s interpretation of the Gita:
to fight, as the old cliché goes, fire with fire. [242]

While the lokamanya might have approved, like with him this attitude

nevertheless proved injurious to Savarkar’s _personal_ interests. As Dhingra’s
brothers darkly noted, the ‘real culprits’ behind their sibling were ‘in the
background’. [243] The British did not need any persuasion on this point: India
House was closed. But it was another violent event that invited the full fury
of the state upon Savarkar. A member of Abhinav Bharat Society killed an
official in Nasik (a case alluded to in the previous section of this chapter).
And it turned out that his gun was one of twenty couriered from London by
Savarkar, who had also circulated a bomb-making manual. [244] Even as many
of his friends were rounded up, their leader fled to Paris. But he didn’t stay
—whether from guilt at having abandoned his post when men like Dhingra
went bravely to the gallows, [245] or because he calculated that a trial in
England was unlikely to hurt, given that evidence was circumstantial, [246]

Savarkar returned to London. He was arrested—posing defiantly in his
police photograph—and a series of charges were slapped. But he had


-----

blundered. The British had no intention of trying Savarkar here; branding
years-old speeches he gave in _India_ seditious, they shipped this ‘ablest of
the Indian revolutionaries’ [247] off to the colony, and into the jaws of a
draconian legal system. Conviction now was certain. It was in this doomed
situation that Savarkar squeezed himself out of that porthole in Marseilles.

His trial, which followed, had some parallels with Tilak’s. For instance,

the defence here also argued that his speeches looked seditious chiefly due
to incompetent translation. [248] Savarkar professed innocence while refusing
to acknowledge the court’s authority; ‘in England . . . one can expect to get
justice,’ he announced, but not in India. [249] When the verdict came, his
sentence added up to half a century in prison, effectively meaning that the
next time the twenty-six-year-old could walk free, he would be approaching
eighty. Moreover, he would not spend this term on the mainland, but on the
Andaman Islands, in a jail notorious for its tortures. [250] Packed into a vessel
with every class of criminal, sleeping with his face by a make-do chamber
pot, Savarkar reached his new home in 1911. [251] At first, Ramdas’s teachings
inspired stoicism. ‘Your food may be delicious, yet it must turn into vomit
and shit,’ the sage had said. ‘You might drink the water of the sacred Ganga,
but this too must pass ultimately as piss.’ [252] So Savarkar accepted his fate.
But he did not budge on his views: Two years later, it was noted—in
another parallel with Tilak—that he showed no ‘regret or repentance’. [253]

And yet, there was a difference. The lokamanya spent his time in Mandalay
reading and writing. Savarkar, on the other hand, had to endure hard labour,
yoked like an ox for hours every day to an oil mill. [254] He thought more than
once of suicide but desisted—he would not give the British, he wrote later,
the satisfaction of his ‘dying like a dog’. [255]

In the end, Savarkar spent over a decade in the Andamans, where slowly

his revolutionary urges wilted. [256] In the beginning, he refused work: What
logic was there, he asked, in imposing physical chores like coir-pounding
on men of cerebral frames? [257] For his intransigence, in 1914, he was
punished with seven days of standing handcuffed; when he continued to
resist, he was put in chains for months. [258] But others were also striking, so


-----

by 1915, the prison administration relaxed its grip; library access was
granted too, where the shelves, funnily enough, held Mazzini’s titles.
However, despite material improvements, the ex-revolutionary’s health was
shattered. As, it is patent, was his spirit. In 1913, for example, he
complained about not being permitted to go outside like ordinary prisoners.
‘I have 50 years staring me in the face! How can I pull up moral energy
enough to pass them’? [259] While he did not disown his deeds, he promised
he was now a convert to constitutionalism, ‘ready to serve the
government’. [260] The next year, he seconded this with a more supplicant
petition, offering himself to the British effort during the First World War. [261]

Two more memorials were posted, but it was 1921 before Savarkar, at last,
expressed _regret_ for being ‘caught up in the whirlwinds of political
passions’; he was ‘a mere boy’ in 1910, who had now learnt his lesson. [262]

His admirers claim this was a ‘tactical ruse to secure a release and thereafter
plan a future strategy’. [263] Detractors, however, sneer that Savarkar’s
appeals for clemency show how, despite loud rhetoric, when it came to _real_
courage, his account was in a deficit. [264] It is an unkind stance. But such
attacks on Savarkar have much to do with aversion for the ideology he
would now make his life’s mission. [265]

This next chapter of Savarkar’s story begins in 1924. By this time, much

had changed in India’s political environment and the British decided to
release their high-profile captive. [266] First, he had to sign a degrading
statement—described in the press as ‘shocking’ [267] —accepting that his trial
and sentence were fair, and forswearing ‘methods of violence’. [268] There
were other terms too: Savarkar was to remain within the limits of Ratnagiri
district, south of Bombay, and play no part in politics—conditions that were
withdrawn only in 1937. That he chafed against these is clear: In March
1925, he published an article on Hindu–Muslim violence in the north-west,
attacking Gandhi. [269] (Who incidentally had publicly urged his release. [270] )
On being questioned, Savarkar insisted the piece was not political but a type
of cultural criticism. [271] To officials, it was obvious that his speeches and
writings were ‘almost incitements to violence’, cloaked in ‘social reform


-----

propaganda’. [272] But he was shrewd: Evidently he printed much under the
names of his brothers when they contained problematic content, or through
pseudonyms. [273] After all, what he admitted as his, was _still_ susceptible to
proscription. When he began a column in the _Kesari_ describing his time in
the Andamans, the government ordered it stopped. When these articles were
compiled in a 1927 book and translated into English, it was banned. [274] An
anonymously published _Life of Barrister Savarkar_ (1926) met the same
fate. [275] Curiously enough, however, the British never rearrested him,
though quite aware of his stunts. For Savarkar was a sharp critic of Gandhi
also, and in this regard, the colonial government saw in him a useful
instrument. [276]

Either way, unlike his (by now departed) guru Tilak, Savarkar could not

directly re-enter the political stage or freely opine on national issues. But if,


-----

in his own words, politics was the sword, ‘social reforms’ were the
shield. [277] As a revolutionary, he had wielded the first, so now he directed
his energies to a cause that would seal his place in history: Hindutva. For
many, it remains a puzzle that Savarkar should become a proponent of
Hindu nationalism. Yes, as a teenager, he got into scuffles with Muslims,
but as a man, his patriotism looked inclusive. In his book on 1857, for
instance, he urged a concord between Hindus and their Muslim countrymen.
In Shivaji’s day, when Islamic rule troubled Hindus, a ‘feeling of hatred’
was ‘just’; today, however, he explained, it would be ‘foolish’. [278] If in that
1909 book he quoted Ramdas in its early pages, at its close was a couplet
by the final Mughal emperor. [279] Hindus and Muslims, despite an imperfect
history, were to the younger Savarkar ‘brothers by blood’ and ‘children of
the same mother’; a ‘natural comradeship’ united them, and the rebellion
was its proof. [280] Indeed, the ‘Revolution of 1857’ was a ‘test to see how far
India had come towards unity, independence, and popular power’; it marked
the country’s maturity and readiness for political evolution. [281] The message
was clear, then: Savarkar of his twenties believed in a nationalism that
welcomed _all_ Indians. India belonged to ‘whoever is born there’. [282] As a
stance, it even matched Gandhi’s and that of Congress moderates. [283]

Savarkar in his forties was a different man, however; and Hindus, in his

mind, were not just the largest of all communities with a stake in the nation
but sole claimants to its title deed. This argument appeared first in his
_Essentials of_ _Hindutva_ , smuggled out of prison in 1923, and today, a
century later, ‘the de facto bible of militant and exclusionary Hindu
nationalism’. [284] To start with, Savarkar clarified that Hindu _ness_ was not
synonymous with Hindu _ism_ ; one could shun the Vedas and yet be Hindu. [285]

Indeed, in defining Hindutva, his terms were disarmingly simple: India
must be one’s fatherland, or the home of one’s ancestors, but it must equally
be one’s ‘holyland’: the country of one’s faith and all it held sacred. By this
measure, Saivas, Vaishnavas, Jains, Buddhists, Sikhs and so on were
invariably Hindu, even if only the first two recognised Hindu _ism_ . Muslims
and Christians, however, were barred. Yes, India was their homeland, and


-----

they shared blood with brown men; but their ‘holylands’ were in ‘Arabia or
Palestine’. This meant ‘[t]heir love is divided’. [286] There was a context to
this framing: After the First World War when the Ottoman sultan (also the
caliph of Islam) was toppled, Muslim leaders in India organized an antiBritish agitation for the caliphate’s restoration. Gandhi lent it full support,
in the hopes of securing Hindu–Muslim relations. But for Savarkar, this was
proof that Muslims would always have allegiances outside of India; that
loyalties to foreign institutions ‘would always pose a political threat to
Hindu sovereignty’. [287] Or as he later declared, Muslims and Christians ‘had
no permanent interest’ here. If ‘driven away they could go to other countries
where their brethren lived.’ But Hindus had nowhere ‘ _except_ India’. [288] They
alone, to quote the scholar Janaki Bakhle, possessed an ‘undivided,
monogamous love’ for their homeland. [289]

Savarkar’s 150-page effort to delineate Hindus as a modern political unit

was, conceptually, a triumph. For in _Essentials,_ he achieved something far
more powerful and practical than Tilak’s Hindutva. The lokamanya,
ultimately, presented the idea in religious terms such as loyalty to the
Vedas. [290] But this begged the question: What _was_ Hinduism? Was it
Brahminism compressed into Sanskrit manuscripts? Was it temple culture,
which sat at odds with Dayananda’s ‘true’ faith? Or was it the distilled
philosophy men like Ram Mohun Roy advertised to the West? And what of
the contradictory customs that had no basis in any texts, existing
unshakeably in the realm of habit only? With Hinduism itself not amenable
to easy or uniform definition, any Hindutva constructed on its back would
be—and was—contested. But Savarkar, skirting these issues, anchored his
ideas in history: If philosophy, he once wrote, tended to make one question
life’s purpose, history felt empowering in pulling _through_ life. [291] And _his_
Hindutva was designed to empower, built not on faith therefore but on a
shared past. It did not matter if you were Brahmin or non-Brahmin; it made
no difference if you worshipped tribal deities with blood or poured
sanctified milk over Brahminical gods. You might even fight one another in
terms of caste and theology. [292] But so long as you shared blood as well as a

sacred attachment to India—not Mecca or Rome—you were Hindu: heirs to
a single heritage and one personality. [293] Or as the scholar Christophe
Jaffrelot puts it, he borrowed a degree of openness from territorial or
political nationalism (allowing most, though not all, membership of the
nation), while utilizing cultural nationalism (to strategically exclude a
few). [294] It was a theoretical masterstroke, placing Hinduness in its current
mould. [295]

To enable this, Savarkar naturally purveyed the past not as a scholar but

as an ideologue. And where that shared past, so essential to his formulation,
did not exist, it was made to exist. History, in his books, that is, appears not
in its own context or on its own terms but as raw fodder to support a
predetermined position (which in and of itself was not new; Phule too
subordinated academic exactness to constructing a community of
resistance). This he defended by pointing to the colonial state’s own selfserving scholarship. Even in his 1909 book, Savarkar protested the ‘wicked [296]
and partial spirit’ in which writers painted 1857. His own goal was to
demonstrate the rebellion’s ‘real spirit’. [297] Consequently, complex
motivations were reduced to simplistic emotions. In his translation of
Mazzini’s writings too, he admitted that the intent was not to see it ‘as
History’ but to leave readers ‘thrilled and inspired’ to imitate the Italian. [298]

In _Essentials_ , therefore, Savarkar does not offer a dispassionate analysis,
instead doing what his rivals seemed to do: conscripting the past to tell a
story. History here was about rearranging events to address present-day
contingencies. To this end, he did not hesitate to make ‘an occasional
excursion into the borderland of conjecture’ either. [299] Thus, the birth of the
Hindu nation was placed in the age of the Ramayana, and throughout
history, in all situations, Savarkar perceived Hindus ‘acting and thinking _as_
_Hindus for Hindus_ and Hindusthan’. [300] Other identities and triggers were
secondary. After all, the nation, he decided, must ‘be the master and not the
slave of its own history’. [301] And so, he would tell the story Hindus _needed_
to hear to enthrone Hindutva and seize power. [302]


-----

One consequence of this approach was that to Savarkar, all of Indian

history was a prolonged battle for Hindu self-determination. Everything
was viewed through the lens of a Hindu nation. For instance, in what was

303
also a dig at Gandhi, he noted how in ancient times, the ‘opiate’ of nonviolence had proved ‘disastrous to the national virility’. What actually
served Hindus was action. To a degree, Savarkar’s conclusions were rooted
in general fact: It was, he argued, ‘furious conflict’ with Muslims that made
Hindus ‘intensely conscious’ of their nationality. [304] As we saw in the
Introduction, exposure to Islam did catalyse the making of a Hindu identity.
However, this was neither ‘intense’ nor national. But that to Savarkar made
little difference—an embryonic truth was enough to jump to conclusions. [305]

In a 1925 book on the Marathas, similarly, Savarkar made grand claims.
‘[D]istrict after district, and town after town,’ we read, ‘rejoiced’ to see their
flag. [306] If this sat poorly with the truth, given how Hindus (outside
Maharashtra) had resisted Maratha expansion, it was dismissed as
‘strange’. [307] Later in the text, Savarkar switches gears to claim that those
challenging the Marathas did so because they too were seeking to head
‘Hindudom’; this was not internal conflict but only a ‘trial of strength’ over
leadership. Besides, if the Marathas were cruel to fellow Hindus, it was
only because their accomplishments granted them a ‘right to expect’
submission. [308] After all, ‘for the sake of Italian unity Garibaldi, Victor
Emmanuel and others’ too fought ‘not only with the foreigners’ but also
other Italians. If history ‘absolves them’, it must also the Marathas who
revivified the nation. [309] While India’s leading professional historian of the
day understandably dismissed Savarkar’s work as a ‘chauvinistic brag’, [310]

its emotional appeal was nevertheless remarkable. [311]

But, of course, as the lokamanya had also learnt, even the best

intellectual exercises could not miraculously remake the world. And
Savarkar, travelling where his guru hesitated to go, viewed caste as the
greatest _practical_ hurdle to Hindu consolidation. He transformed himself
therefore into what those non-Brahmin intellectuals sought: a Brahmin who
identified purely as Hindu. Only months after his release, he declared, thus:


-----

‘We must forget these [caste based] differences . . . we are all Hindus . . .
the only common denominator.’ [312] What mattered was not separate caste
groupings but a united ethnic identity. [313] Tilak had identified Christianity as
one of the great threats facing Hindus, but he could not offer a workable
response to the attractions conversion offered, given his own commitment
to caste. [314] Savarkar, though, was direct: Only embracing Hinduness on
equal terms with their lower-caste fellows could ‘crush the designs of
foreigners’. [315] The nation was sacred; caste ‘dismembered’ it. [316] Equally,
he asked subordinate castes not to ‘threaten to leave’; Hinduism was not the
‘exclusive preserve of upper castes’. [317] In Ratnagiri, in fact, Savarkar
scandalized the orthodoxy. Where even Brahmins subgroups would not dine
together, he organized feasts where all castes ate as one. Between 1930 and
1935, 150 such exhibitions of commensality were staged. [318] While
elsewhere in Maharashtra men worked anxiously to accommodate modern
values within frames of scripture, [319] Savarkar declared he would not let
archaic texts ‘become fetters in my feet’; outdated sacred writings must
simply be ‘discarded’. That is, instead of performing intellectual acrobatics
to locate modern ideas in obscure corners of the past, he was happy to move
on. [320] The conservative backlash was instant; one petition demanded that
the British rein in Savarkar and his ‘immoral and irreligious preachings’. [321]

Unbothered, in 1929, he established a temple where all castes worshipped
together. [322] In actualizing Hindu _ness_ , that is, unlike Tilak, his heir was
prepared to bulldoze through even fundamental attributes of everyday
Hindu _ism_ like caste. [323]

And yet, despite his effort, social reform at best promised long-term

results. In a more immediate sense, therefore, mobilization,
à la Tilak, was achieved by maintaining the spectre of a shared enemy. Or
as Savarkar wrote, ‘Nothing can weld peoples into a nation and nations into
a state as the pressure of a common foe. Hatred separates as well as
unites.’ [324] So, inevitably talk of Hindu _sangathan_ (union) meant those
deemed not Hindu came under attack. And Muslims, the largest (and
politically most vocal) minority, were Savarkar’s chief target. Ironically, as


-----

late as 1925, in his book on the Marathas, he assured Muslims that in
critiquing Islamic rule, he was not railing against them as a community.
That would be ‘ridiculous’. [325] But twelve years later, his stance hardened.
Coinciding with the lifting of the limitations placed on him, in 1937 he
likened the British to ‘foreign dacoits’ but also warned Hindus to beware of
a ‘thief’ in their midst. [326] In the 1940s, in a provocative interview with an
American, who asked how Muslims might be treated under Hindu rule,
Savarkar coolly replied: ‘As a minority, in the position of your Negroes.’ [327]

1937 also saw him become head of the Hindu Mahasabha—a cultural body
founded in 1915. [328] While Savarkar saw the Mahasabha as ‘an enlarged and
more comprehensive edition of the Arya Samaj’, [329] under him, it would no
longer remain a religious society. It became, instead, a political party for
Hindus, ‘in all its social, political and cultural aspects’. And hereon, the
Mahasabha would fight not only the secular nationalism of the Congress
(whose members Savarkar likened to eunuchs) but also Muslims. [330]

This shift in Savarkar’s approach towards Muslims—from a willingness

to engage to certified dislike—seems to have multiple roots. One spark was
supposedly personal. His prison memoirs put out that most warders he dealt
with in the Andamans were Muslim. South Indians among them were
supposedly not fanatical, but instigated by peers from the north, they too
exhibited cruelty. [331] Given this division along religious lines—Muslims in
authority, Hindus under watch—petty matters generated hatred. Thus,
(Hindu) prisoners’ food, inadequate to start with, was often filched by
corrupt (Muslim) warders. Muslim inmates were allowed breaks to pray
five times a day, but Hindus were denied the privilege, on grounds that it
was not essential to their faith. For Savarkar, this was confirmation that the
two groups could never live as brothers. [332] Muslims, from infancy, he
added, were reared to believe that converting non-Muslims was a religious
duty; Hindus, meanwhile, belonged to a tradition that acknowledged
multiple ways. Which effectively meant that Muslims did all the feasting,
while Hindus ended repeatedly on the menu. Indeed, in prison jailers too
pressed conversion, he


-----

alleged, and many succumbed, if only for better treatment. [333] In these
circumstances, whatever their old virtues, Hindus would have to get tough,
according to Savarkar. Tolerance was weakness, no matter how it was
romanticized, when surrounded by intolerant faiths. [334] Indeed, jail was the
laboratory where he experimented first with organizing Hindus _as Hindus_ ,
to survive in a hostile environment. [335]

To this might be added a more general preoccupation of this period: an

anxiety about keeping up Hindus’ numerical strength. After all, identity in
twentieth-century India was also a game of numbers. [336] This consciousness
of Hindus—divided into sects and castes—as being a single ‘majority’ was
itself a product of colonial censuses, which enumerated Indians and
solidified what, earlier, were more vague labels. [337] Coupled with concerns
about conversion, which as we saw, had a controversy-ridden history, by the
twentieth century, there was fear that Christians and Muslims were drawing
away critical human capital, particularly from low-caste segments. In 1911,
for example, it was found that in the last decade alone, in just one province,
40,000 Hindus had crossed over to Islam, and 1,20,000 to the church. [338]

The necessity of maintaining a majority vexed not just self-declared Hindu
nationalists or organizations such as the Arya Samaj but also men like
Gandhi: When in the 1930s, the British proposed granting lower-caste
Hindus separate electorates, the mahatma saw this as designed to ‘vivisect
and disrupt’ Hinduism. [339] Indeed, colonial voices did ask that if Hinduism
were formally defined along Brahminical lines, surely those not subscribing
to Brahminism belonged elsewhere? [340] Savarkar’s Hindutva and reform
efforts were a means to resist this; Hindutva had nothing to do with
Brahmins. [341] And he was catering to widespread paranoia. In 1936, for
example, when the Travancore maharajah granted Dalits temple entry, it
was chiefly to prevent conversion and neutralize the missionary threat. [342]

And Savarkar had for long viewed Christian proselytization as a device to
make Hindus ‘ashamed’, deprive them of ‘national feeling’ and strengthen
foreign rule. [343]


-----

The attitude of organizations like the Muslim League, founded in 1906,

exacerbated things. [344] Censuses showed that despite their self-image as a
ruling elite in upper India especially, Muslims did not possess strength in
numbers. So, to hold their own, and maintain a measure of political power,
some argued that they constituted a separate _nation_ . That is, if they were
just a fragmented community among others, Muslims would be a ‘perpetual
minority’; asserting status as a _nation_ , helped duck this ‘logic of numbers’,
and claim parity with Hindus. [345] In a 1906 address to the viceroy, in fact, a
delegation of Muslim grandees specifically required that the community be
viewed ‘not merely’ on the basis of ‘numerical strength’ but also its
‘political importance’; memories of power had ‘not faded’ from their
minds. [346] India, in other words, housed not one but two peoples. Of course,
like with the Hindu identity, this too had contradictions: Malabar’s
matrilineal Muslims venerated the Quran, as did Muslims in Bhopal; but in
colour, dress, food and language, they were strangers. [347] Cultural
distinctions, in fact, made some Muslims look unIslamic even: As late as
1943, a report expressed annoyance with Kashmir in the north. A ‘true . . .
religious leadership’ was absent, it complained, and ‘counterfeit’ preceptors
‘legalised for [Kashmiris] everything that drives [a] coach and four through

[mainstream] Islam’. It would take great effort to ‘convert them into true
Muslims’. [348] That is, like those Hindus who stressed a single identity, the
League too built its position on the myth of a monolithic Muslim category.
Claims of separate nationhood depended on it. Congress under Gandhi,
meanwhile, denied both these claims, insisting that the only nation in the
country, open to all, was a united _Indian_ one.

Savarkar, however, refused to allow territorial nationalism, also

dismissing Congress’s efforts to brand Hindutva an illegitimate religious
supremacism. Addressing the Mahasabha in 1937, he noted that all
nationalism was ultimately ‘a parochial conception’. If Congress’s logic
were allowed, should men not see the earth as their motherland and
humanity as the true nation? Congress ought, then, to stress universal
brotherhood—why had it cut out those living south of the Himalayas as


-----

‘Indians’? In any case, if Congress could do this, it had no right to tell
Hindus off for imagining the nation via the conceptual frontiers of
Hindutva. Similarly, to call Hindu nationalism reactionary did not, in his
view, stick. For, by that measure, why fight the Raj, ‘our brothers in
Humanity’? Was that also not a reaction to British rule? No, the fact was
that every nation defined itself in distinction to another, and Hindutva
defended the ‘fundamental rights of a particular nation’; Congress and he
just drew boundaries differently. [349] The latter, in fact, erred in elevating
territoriality. In the past, he wrote, England was a ‘clear-cut territorial unit’.
But in fraught times, Catholics showed divided loyalties; these Englishmen
cared more for alien Rome ‘than their Protestant English Sovereigns’. It
was proof that territorial allegiance by itself could never forge a nation. [350]

This is why, to Savarkar, nationalism had necessarily to be reinforced with
culture. And when it came to this, Muslims had their ‘faces . . . ever turned
towards Mecca’; to a Hindu, on the other hand, ‘India is all in all of his
National being.’ Only Hindus were committed to the country. [351] Which
meant also that their interests were _the_ national interest.

On the ground, then, the politician in Savarkar urged practical action to

sustain a majority. In a universe of missionary faiths, he called on Hindus to
cultivate missionary qualities—or viewed another way, to become what
their enemies were. In prison, he claimed already to have run a programme,
inspired by the Arya Samaj, to reconvert those who went over to Islam. On
his release, this became a key plank for Hindutva. For ‘[e]ven if a man is a
thief,’ it was declared, ‘a Hindu thief is less dangerous . . . than a Muslim’.
For unlike the latter, a Hindu would ‘merely thieve’ not ‘destroy temples,

[or] smash idols’. [352] ‘If the Moslems increase in population,’ he wrote
similarly in 1938, ‘the centre of political power is bound to be shifted in
their favour’ [sic]. [353] At the time of the Bengal Famine of the 1940s,
alleging that Muslims were buying converts ‘like vegetables’, dispensing


-----

grain for allegiance, [354] he asked Hindu groups to ‘rescue, feed, clothe and
shelter Hindu sufferers alone’; that is, to behave as deviously as Muslims
did (supposedly). [355] Savarkar grew even more acidic as the League’s claims
to represent a Muslim nation acquired political wings. Indeed earlier too, in
his younger days, tolerance for Muslims had been, in the end, conditional.
Or as his 1909 book observes, if the two communities worked together
during the Great Rebellion, it was because Hindus had already broken
Islamic power, redressing ‘national shame’. Brotherhood emerged _because_
Muslims no longer ruled India. [356] The League’s efforts to assert itself, then,
looked to him like a strategy to resurrect an unnatural dynamic. And this,
inevitably, was prejudicial to Hindu priority in their holyland.

But, Savarkar added, Hindus had only themselves to blame. Historically,

the ‘Hindu mind’ was too ‘tolerant’, which to him was another word for
‘shameless or callous’. [357] So, ‘no evidence can generally be found . . . to
show if anyone was yearning to avenge the Muslims atrocities and their
religious victory’. [358] After 1857, Hindus again ‘began to pamper the

359
Muslims by respecting their whims’, till the latter grew ‘swollenheaded’. That is, to resist the Raj, nationalists placed a premium on
interfaith harmony; and Muslims, exploited this. [360] The Congress, he
warned, was letting the League blackmail it. [361] Hindus did not demand ‘an
inch more for [themselves] than what is due . . . in relation to their
population proportions’. They would even let non-Hindus live in peace. But
Muslims sought ‘to browbeat the Hindus into yielding . . . more than what
is due to them’. [362] Even the press’s equating of Congress and the League as
India’s main parties irritated Savarkar. For it served to ‘insinuate and
inculcate the idea that Hindus and Moslems . . . stood on equal footing’.
Nothing, in his opinion, could be more ridiculous. [363] As the League began
demanding a separate state—Pakistan—his umbrage was magnified. ‘If
anybody says that Wales should exercise self-determination and fall out of
Great Britain, he would be shot dead.’ [364] But Congress, he declared, instead
of taking a tough line with the League, went out to attack the _Mahasabha_
for frightening Muslims. ‘Get looted,’ it seemed to him to say, ‘but don’t


-----

report; get stabbed, but don’t shriek; get repressed as Hindus but don’t
organize to resist it as Hindus; or else you will be damned as traitors to the
cause of our Indian nationalism’. [365]

For all his eloquence, however, the Mahasabha neither succeeded in

building an organizational base, nor in wooing many Hindus. [366] Not least
because Congress also, behind a veneer of high-minded impartiality, often
acted like a Hindu party, sans the divisive language. Most Hindu interests,
then, backed Gandhi’s entity instead of betting on a more extreme party. [367]

Worse, when during the Second World War, Gandhi launched the Quit India
agitation—triggering, in the British viceroy’s words, ‘the most serious
rebellion since that of 1857’ [368] —Savarkar, who once wrote a book _on_ 1857,
quietly compromised with the Raj. The British had thrown Congress leaders
in jail and were scouting for brown allies; Savarkar now became one of
these allies. Brandishing ‘responsive cooperation’—an idea Tilak crafted to
allow occasional understandings with the colonial government—Savarkar
saw a window for the Mahasabha to swell in stature. All forms of
justification were arrayed to support this move, which has caused
embarrassment since. [369] So too the fascination Savarkar and his supporters
felt for Nazi Germany backfired. ‘It is absurd to call [Hindus merely] a
community in India,’ he declared once. ‘The Germans are the nation in
Germany and the Jews a Community.’ [370] Another Mahasabha man wished
Hindus to ‘[m]ake Savarkar your Fuehrer’. [371] At a youth conference held
alongside the party’s 1938 session, one resolution even read: ‘Muslims to
be Treated like Jews.’ [372] Germany and Italy, Savarkar noted, had ‘grown so
powerful’ at the ‘touch of the Nazi or Fascist wand’; this showed that these
ideologies were ‘congenial tonics’ for those nations. [373] And as if to
elucidate what this might mean in India, in 1944, his secretary suggested
keeping Muslims in ‘internment camps’ until ‘security of their good
conduct is guaranteed.’ ‘This,’ he wrote, ‘is Savarkarism.’ [374]


-----

In 1947—almost 200 years after Clive’s victory at the Battle of Plassey—
the British were ejected from the subcontinent. But they left a visible,
festering legacy, for the country was divided. The Muslim League got
Pakistan, and what remained, under Congress, would fashion itself as a
secular republic. But this partition was marked by bloodshed, and resultant
Hindu–Muslim strife. Hindu nationalists never forgave Congress for letting
the League win. In 1948, Gandhi was murdered: an event some Mahasabha
units celebrated with sweets. [375] In fact, twelve years prior, an official had
mused how it was not difficult to visualize Savarkar liquidating the
mahatma. [376] As it happened, the assassin was a Chitpavan Brahmin by the
name of Nathuram Godse (1910–49). And Godse, a tailor, was part of
Savarkar’s circle, having met the latter first when he was nineteen. [377] But
even as he made use of his mentor’s speeches in drafting his court
statement, [378] Godse distanced Savarkar from his violence. In fact, he
proclaimed it ‘an insult to my intelligence’ to be suspected of being
someone’s ‘tool’. [379] Not everyone was convinced, though. Savarkar—who
had retired from active politics in 1944, suffered a heart attack, lost his
teeth, and even found himself cornered in the Mahasabha after his flirtation
with the Raj [380] —was arrested but declined knowledge of, or participation
in, the plot. [381] While he was acquitted for want of proof, an odour of
suspicion lingered over the man’s name nonetheless. [382] As it still does, all
these decades later.

Retreating to Bombay, Savarkar died in the political wilderness. Indeed,

just as he was under British surveillance in his twenties, he spent his last
years watched by the Indian government. [383] After a meeting with him some
years before, the penultimate British viceroy had written: ‘I thought

[Savarkar] an unpleasant, intolerant little man, full of communal
bitterness.’ [384] And at the end of his career—which had seen guns and plots,
prison, and an unrealized mission to give Hindu nationalism wide political
appeal—what seemed to remain was indeed bitterness. This comes across in
Savarkar’s final major offering, a yarn around six ‘glorious epochs’ in
Indian history. Between its fanciful interpretations of the past, there is much


-----

frustration, as Savarkar vents on how Hindus _ought_ to have behaved; of
what he saw as lost opportunities. [385] When, for example, foreigners invaded
from the north-west in ancient times, southern Hindus, he claimed, had a
‘national duty’ to rush to upper India—this, when there was no national
sentiment anywhere in that era. [386] Christianity in Kerala, similarly, which
spread peacefully, was to Savarkar an ‘infiltration’ that converted ‘millions .
. . at the point of the bayonet’; an argument built on pure imagination. [387]

Islamic conquerors raped women, but Hindus, with ‘perverted’ ideas of
‘chivalry’, compounded it by acting honourably with Muslim women.
Suppose, Savarkar wondered, ‘Hindus also . . . decided to pay the Muslim
“fair sex” in the same coin’—Muslims ‘could not have thrived so
audaciously’. [388]

But on the whole, the book reads as frustration with his own times: how

Hindus actually behaved in supporting Congress, versus what they should
have done—backed him. [389] The problem this father of Hindutva confronted
was that while there were Hindus, most were not the type he _wished_ them to
be; the kind of people for whom he had (re)written whole histories. He
hoped Hindus would do as Muslims did in this ‘millennial’ war, becoming a
mirror image of their supposed civilizational enemies. [390] Sadly, the bulk of
them didn’t seem interested: Hindus’ innate diversity stood in the way of
crafting one identity, one vision and one purpose. So, from Savarkar’s
perspective, even after the British left the country, when Indians ruled
themselves, the story had not ended. And under the decades-long
dominance of Congress, which (formally at least) stayed wedded to
religious neutrality, Hindutva—already facing a crisis after’s Gandhi’s
murder—retreated into the shadows.

And yet, he need not have worried. For the power of an idea is that it can

germinate and flourish long after its original agents are dead. And proof of
Hindutva’s resilience came less than four decades after Savarkar’s death. In
2003, the president of the Indian republic unveiled a fresh portrait in
Parliament. And there, in what is often called the temple of Indian
democracy, today hangs, next to a picture of Gandhi, the image of the man
who allegedly inspired his murder. Life did not give Savarkar all he had
hoped for. But Hindutva, it turned out, was biding its time. And not too long
after he was enshrined in the house of the people, having won power, it
would begin a process—now well underway—of remaking the Indian state
in its own image.

#### Epilogue

 What is Hinduism?

In June 1889, a man called W.H. Findlay produced a crisp defence of
missionary activity in India. Writing in the _Harvest Field_ , he challenged the
increasingly prevalent view that evangelical work, in education particularly,
was a failure. After all, the argument went, far from converting in large
quantities, brown men were subverting Western formulas of thinking for
‘attempts to revive Hinduism’. What we might today call evidence of
‘native’ agency triggered laments in Findlay’s colleagues. But he himself
proposed a different view; movements to reform Hinduism were, in his
mind, proof of Christianity’s _success_ in the land. Yes, as ‘Hindus begin to
awaken’, it was ‘natural, and indeed proper, that they should first resort to
the religion of their fathers’; that the initial ‘result of the operation of the
spirit of Christianity’ must ‘almost necessarily be a revival of Hinduism’.
But this defensive instinct would, Findlay believed, run aground. And when
Hindus, following childish attempts to build with borrowed tools what
Christianity alone could guarantee, realized this, they would ‘accept what
we offer’. The modern rebranding of Hinduism, in other words, was not an
event in its own right but merely a step to ‘the complete and general
triumph of Christianity’. It was a temporary case of ‘Christian wine in
Hindu bottles’; in the next stage, those ‘bottles [would] burst’. Indeed, the
very fact that through ‘our schools and colleges’ missionaries had stirred
Hindus to re-envision their religion was a victory. Or as the man explained:

The task the revivers of Hinduism have set themselves is to make it satisfy new ideals
which they have accepted from Christianity. They are not supporting Hinduism as their
fathers believed it . . . they are trying to imagine it to be, or to frame out of it, a worthy
rival of Christianity . . . So ignorant have Hindus, in general, been in the past, of what
their conglomerate religion is, that they can easily persuade themselves that what they


-----

now call Hinduism is the old genuine belief of their fathers, which in our descriptions we
grossly malign. But this error of theirs is of very secondary importance. Our triumph is
that the Hindus who have, at last, begun to value religion, have a high, a Christian ideal

of what a religion should be. [1]

Its blind wishfulness aside, there is some truth to Findlay’s assertion. As we
have seen, dialogue with missionaries that began in the sixteenth century
first provoked puzzled amusement and some petty irritation on the Hindu
side. But the advent of European power in the land rendered Christianity a
concern. Even if the number of converts was never alarmingly high, [2] the
joining of the Bible with white political authority represented a challenge to
‘native’ ways of thinking, organizing society, and defining faith and
divinity. All along, Western ideas that presented religion as a fixed,
consistent affair—with a book, core principles, a mania for monotheism—
played on colonized minds. And so, in adapting to survive, Hindu
intellectuals reframed their beliefs. Figures like Ram Mohun Roy represent
this impulse: a desire to synthesize a dominant idea of what ‘religion’ ought
to look like, with matching bits in the Hindu tradition. This meant that some
elements of the Hindu past were espoused, others branded adulteration;
some ideas of god exaggerated but a plurality of living traditions denied.
After all, as the social theorist Ashis Nandy observes, ‘[T]he ultimate
violence which colonialism does to its victims’ is that ‘it creates a culture in
which the ruled are constantly tempted to fight their rulers within the
psychological limits set by the latter.’ [3] And Findlay had a point when he
noted that Christianity’s triumph lay in determining exactly these
psychological terms for colonized Hindus.

And yet, this triumph was hardly total or unqualified, for Indians never

ceased to resist. Even in a politically enervated state, even with the terms of
engagement set by another, the colonized mind found strategies to assert
itself; to try and shape matters to its own advantage. At an intellectual level,
after all, Roy, while he accepted a new structure for Hinduism, used the
same process to critique Christianity as well. As the scholar Eric Sharpe
wrote, one characteristic of modernity is that ‘sacred scriptures, whatever
their origin’ could be ‘read by those for whom they were initially not


-----

intended’. Holy texts, in alien hands, could be examined ‘not in the light of

[their] ‘original’ religious, liturgical, philosophical or social setting’ but
against ‘entirely different presuppositions’. [4] The Vedas and Puranas were
subjected to this process first, and Europeans ‘discovered’ in them whatever
they desired: from Voltaire’s undefiled monotheism, to the ‘shameful’ gods
and polytheism that so agitated missionaries. Each party made use of these
‘discoveries’ to bolster their views and positions; they utilised Hinduism
and India to develop _their_ sense of self and _their_ identities vis-à-vis others.
‘Native’ thinkers like Roy, however, reversed the gaze. And they too drew
from the West what they felt essential to reconstructing and defending _their_
positions under colonialism, while rejecting all that did not fit this need. It
was a case of selective appropriation to meet contingencies of the age. And
what brown men seized, it can be argued, was not Christian wine for Hindu
bottles, but Christian bottles for Hindu wine. [5]

It is this acquisition of a new shape, with its tendency to mimic the

Christian pattern, that often sparks the argument that modern Hinduism is
‘invented’; that in squeezing a diversity of beliefs and sects uncomfortably
into those Christian frames, what was manufactured was synthetic yarn. [6]

While there is no doubt that colonialism and exposure to the West
dramatically altered Hinduism—indeed, even gave it its current name—the
suggestion that this is ‘invention’, and by extension lacks legitimacy, is
somewhat simplistic. It assumes, for one, that Hinduism could never
reincarnate itself; that it could only have one appearance—fluid, loose,
amorphous—that defies attempts to place it within solid brackets, like water
on a sieve. [7] However, we know that long before Europeans arrived on the
scene, Hindu intellectuals had already started to delineate a separate identity
_as Hindus_ . One impetus came from Islamic rule. Or as the historian
Muzaffar Alam notes, ‘By the fourteenth century the term Hindu had
significantly begun to denote a religious culture to encompass all such cults
and traditions as originated and developed within the geographical limits’ of
India. Muslim accounts bunched together many types of traditions, ranging
from the Brahminical to those antithetical to it, under the label ‘Hindu’. [8] By


-----

this yardstick, Hinduism’s ‘invention’ began not in the colonial era but
several centuries before, in the reign of sultans. European rule, it would
appear, only ripened what already existed in a foetal shape, its conception
the product of a different set of encounters. [9]

Viewed against the long arc of history, though, ‘invention’ still grants too

much power to those on the outside, while denying those supposedly being
‘invented’ any autonomy. In pre-Islamic India, sects and groups we now
lump as Hindu—Saivas, Vaishnavas, Saktas, each representing a spectrum
—had something in common when contrasted with Jains and Buddhists. [10]

Already, that is, seeds of unity existed, alongside that Brahminical drive for
it discussed at the start of this book. However, _assertion_ of such unity
became necessary only when the context presented itself. After all,
Hinduism was never shaped by a book as much as by the currents of
history. [11] And faced with Islamic rule, motivations grew to fasten these
religious ideas under a shared canopy. To supply an analogy, five brown
persons in a room—each a shade different from the other—might not view
themselves as a single organism. Indeed, they might violently disagree with
one another. But the entry of a white person shifts something; the brown
grow cognizant of their common features. If the new entrant is also
threatening in some respect, that shared brownness becomes a means to
mount joint action. Inner contradictions might remain—not to speak of the
fact that white and brown could cheerfully consort too—but a new dynamic
is born. [12] With Islamic power, even if it was Muslim commentators who
initially lumped diverse non-Muslims into the ‘Hindu’ category, the latter
appropriated the tag, owning it for themselves—because they recognized
value here. [13] Hindus, that is, asserted Hinduness as an overarching principle
precisely because they confronted an identity separate—and occasionally
hostile—to theirs. [14]

This consciousness of a Hinduness grew with time, though it was neither

linear nor the same everywhere, always. [15] And it certainly wasn’t as
categorically defined or total as Savarkar would suggest. Yet _something_ was
underway. It is often noted, for example, that in seventeenth-century


-----

Mughal miniatures, Muslim nobility appear with their upper coat tied on the
right side. Non-Muslims, however, tie the _jama_ to the left. [16] The latter came
from a variety of distinct castes: Rajputs, Brahmin, Kayasthas. Some were
vegetarian, others were not; some offered hereditary scribal service, others
were wedded to the sword. None of these would intermarry or even dine
together. And yet court convention viewed them as a group. As the historian
Gijs Kruijtzer notes, only with the Maratha hero Chhatrapati Shivaji do we
find the jama tied to the right—quite possibly in deliberate
defiance. [17] Aided by the fact that they shared gods and religious practices—
that they had enough in common to transcend caste differences—Hinduness
is implicit. This is not to say that Hindus and Muslims were monoliths; on
the Islamic side, for instance, a whole empire in the Deccan imploded due
to ethnic conflict between Persian immigrants and local Muslims. [18] There
was, that is, no want of dissension. But in specific contexts, religious
identity allowed for networks of solidarity, and for political and social
mobilization. [19] Nor was this just an elite affair. The poet–saint Kabir—a
weaver—in his fifteenth-century writings actively identifies Muslims and
Hindus as separate types. [20] Which suggests there was a recognizable
Hinduness long in the air; colonial pressures only roused this into fortifying
itself a certain way. [21]

In this, borrowing a structure or certain strategies from the West was a

critical innovation, but it was not ‘invention’. Instead, it was an instrument
of _re_ -invention. Dayananda Saraswati, for instance, had been long on the
path of reform, with little exposure to Western thought. [22] A visit to Calcutta
opened his eyes to new strategies and tools, but the desire to reform
appeared from within. Communities in general are not concrete blocs; they
are ‘social formations continuously engaged in self-recreation’. [23] Identities
shift and transform; all of Hinduism’s history, we know, is marked by
adaptation. Indeed, there had once been several versions of Christianity as
well. Eventually, some readings gained precedence, and internal coherence
was constructed. [24] As with Hindus, there were ‘large bodies of Christians
who did not believe all the same things and who had relatively little to do


-----

with each other’. [25] Yet, just as Rajputs and Brahmins possessed caste
identities but also shared a Hinduness, different varieties of Christians also
could claim a shared Christianity. And this could be selectively drawn on, in
times of nervousness especially. Thomas Roe, Britain’s envoy to the
Mughals, for example, met at Emperor Jahangir’s court an Italian Jesuit.
The latter requested that despite a ‘vast difference’ in their view of religion
—Catholic and Protestant—they must avoid displaying this. For it would
hinder conversion. [26] In _this_ setting, that is, unity was urged; in Europe, on
the other hand, sectarian prejudices looked incompatible. Indeed, among
India’s Hindus and Muslims, ‘Europeans came to feel more like members
of a [more singular] Christian community than they would have felt’ at
home. [27]

In other words, the white figure entering that room full of brown people

was reminded also of his own whiteness in that moment. [28] And just as the
latter evolved their sense of self and its strategies of self-preservation to
address the new environment, so did he. De Nobili, as we have seen, was a
committed Catholic. Yet, the Catholicism he administered among the Tamils
looked little like its main fount in Rome: the acquisition of the Brahmin’s
sacred thread, the embrace of Hindu customs and caste, rebranding the
Bible as a Veda—these generated controversy in Europe. But de Nobili was
a white man in a country where brown men still prevailed; so, he adapted
his religion to their terms. At that time, it was he who repackaged his wine,
transferring Christianity to Hindu bottles. As the tables turned, however,
and foreigners mastered the land, grafting onto it their own ideas—as
evidenced, for instance, by ‘Hindu law’—it was Hindus who were pressed
to reinvent themselves. New institutions and novel conceptions of the world
came into play, and they responded—as all societies do. Where religion is
concerned, Europe pictured it as a specific type of box with specific
contents. ‘Native’ minds hitherto experienced religion as a network of
beliefs, yes; but living under colonial pressures now, many endorsed the
box, populating it with chosen strands from their traditions. [29] And if de
Nobili’s Christianity, despite innovations—tolerating even the odd goat


-----

sacrifice—was still Christianity, Hinduism’s latest avatar is also Hinduism,
in a fresh garb. [30]


-----

Brahma, engraved by de Marlet, from The Stapleton Collection/Bridgeman Images. As with the

deity’s several heads and faces, Hinduism too features a new, different face in the modern age.


-----

Indeed, where Hindus are concerned, the acquisition of new clothes for

older bodies—even if they were of foreign design—appears in other
contexts too, making this a familiar shift. The Travancore rajahs, for
example, defined themselves as not sovereigns but vassals of the deity, Sri
Padmanabhaswamy (Vishnu). Their kingdom ‘belonged’ to him, and they
were only his custodians—a very Vaishnava, Hindu and Brahminical
definition of their political selves. Yet, even as they served this role, they
also operated in a world organized around other principles. In the eighteenth
century, with the aura of the Mughals still alive, the same rajahs, thus,
found value in Persianate culture. In their ‘original’ form, they were
exclusively a deity’s vassals; now they sought titles from a Muslim
emperor. [31] In temple processions, the rajahs appeared bare-chested in line
with Hindu ritual tradition; in court, they wore the jama as in Islamic
durbars. While diplomatic correspondence was conducted in Persian, with
the ascent of the British, these Malayalam speakers began to learn
English, [32] also acquiring the white man’s clothes by the mid-nineteenth
century. [33] The rajahs were still Hindu, but in each of these contexts, altered
their appearance. Hinduism’s draping of new clothes too—its refashioning
from Hinduness to a modern _ism_ —is a product of such change. And, while
looks convey much, they must not be overstated. To see the body, one must
look past the cloth. Hinduism, we might conclude, then, is only ‘invented’
insofar as all religious categories are invented—and reinvented. [34]

Of course, this process was never uncontested, not only by critics outside

but also those within. While external influences played their part,
nineteenth-century reformers of Hinduism, it is widely acknowledged,
advertised it through an idealized Brahminical frame—so idealized in its
stubborn, exclusive exalting of the (‘pure’, ancient) Vedic over the (living,
breathing) Puranic, that many _Brahmins_ were aggrieved. [35] While purists
always existed among Hindus, [36] appeal for a ‘return to the Vedas’ stemmed
here from the political validation it contained. The Vedas’ philosophical
segments, after all, enjoyed European (orientalist) approval even as the rest
of Hindu culture was lambasted. In a time when colonized Hindus sought


-----

self-respect as well as a shield against missionaries, a Veda-oriented
presentation of religion served multiple purposes. In the process, though,
Hindus themselves denigrated other aspects of their religious system. Yes,
the orthodox Brahmin had always looked down on certain traditions
—‘inferior’ deities, blood rites and popular religion more generally.
However, as the scholar Günther-Dietz Sontheimer wrote, there had in the
past been a ‘continuum’ between different ‘currents of religion’. The
Brahmin of older ages ‘could not and would not abolish folk religion’, only
stamping it as lower in rank. But his modern reformist successor not only
viewed these segments of Hinduism with contempt, he also actively railed
against it, often in language echoing the missionary. [37]

But Hinduism’s equation with a purely Brahminical reading of it was

enabled by another factor too. Even in pre-colonial times, Brahmin
presence in administration and courtly spaces was on the ascendant. In
Hindu states especially, a template of Brahminized ritual and practice was
rising already. [38] This meant that in the modern period, Brahmins were
primed to slide into positions of dominance in the public sphere: They were
at the forefront of engagements with white men, in the press, literate
professions, state offices, political movements, universities and more. In
emergent national spaces, their voices acquired a force exceeding their real
numbers among Hindus. And naturally, their framing of religion gained
potency. So much so that Phule and his school of thought would see in
modern Hinduism not a response to the West—given how they viewed
colonialism as _liberating_ many sections from ‘native’ power structures—but
a strategy to entrench Brahmin control. [39] Others did not go quite as far as
Phule in denouncing Brahminical Hinduism, instead preferring an internal
form of selective appropriation. Thus, in Kerala, Narayana Guru rejected
caste and social practices linked to Brahminical thought but not its
philosophical content. Instead, asking his fellow travellers to give up
‘unclean’ rites and ‘lower’ gods, this sage, himself born in a marginalized
caste, invested in modern Hinduism. Brahminical ideas, that is, were seized
—and amended—by non-Brahmins, just as Hindus had appropriated those
Christian bottles.


-----

Caste, however, remained a problem in answering the question: Who is a

Hindu? Historically, the term, while including many we now locate under
the label, excluded others. As the historian Divya Cherian shows for
eighteenth-century Marwar, the Hindu identity was here positioned not only
in contrast to Muslims but also Dalits (‘untouchables’). Indeed, what
divided Hindu from non-Hindu was untouchability, not faith, Muslims
being cast with ‘polluting’ groups. [40] Other pre-colonial usages of the term
‘Hindu’ also appear restricted to high-caste people. [41] Why, on the cusp of
the twentieth century too, Hindu officials were scandalized at classifying
Dalits as Hindu in decadal censuses; they saw them as ‘them’, not ‘us’. [42] In
1891, the editor of (the fittingly named) _The Hindu_ similarly lamented from
Madras how Hindus did not view castes like the Parayars as ‘part of their
community’. [43] Even in 1916, in Chhattisgarh, to call someone a Hindu
‘convey[ed] primarily that he is not a Chamar’ (a Dalit caste), [44] and many
of Dayananda’s successors too were aghast at the Arya Samaj’s inclusion of
Dalits in its reform programme. [45] So it is not surprising that as late as the
1950s, the political theorist Kancha Ilaiah, growing up Dalit, saw Muslims,
Christians and Brahmins as _all_ ‘different from us’. That the Brahmin and he
belonged in a single tent was news. [46] The historical Hindu, put another way,
represented some specific (privileged, dominant) sections of Indian society,
not the whole. [47]

The ‘modern project of Hindu political monotheism’, however, ‘induct[s]

the privileged and the pariah into a universal, congregational plane of
Hindu identity’. [48] This had something to do with religious belief, but a lot
with politics. After all, as discussed in the previous chapter, with the British
enumerating communities, size began to matter. In fixing who had the
strongest claim on the state’s resources—and with the rise of nationalism,
on the country itself—value emerged in the idea of asserting ‘majority’. [49]

Acquiring Dalits’ numerical loyalties was critical, not least as missionaries
tended to woo them to strengthen ‘minorities’. While Dalit groups in the
past did occasionally negotiate for higher status within the Hindu order, [50] it
was an inconvenient fact that many in the modern period obtained this


-----

outside it. As a south Indian official confirmed, for example, moving to
Christianity opened avenues to employment otherwise sealed from low
castes. [51] In the north, a convert declared: ‘I have become a christian [sic]
and am one of the Sahibs; I shall do no more _bigar_
52
[conventional castebased menial service].’ It was to counter this trend that modern Hinduism
also saw movements to supply Dalits a dignified space inside the Hindu
box, whether it was Savarkar’s anti-caste activism or Gandhi’s. The
mahatma, in fact, even remarked to Ambedkar, the foremost Dalit leader
and intellectual of the twentieth century: ‘You cannot escape the situation
that you are Hindus in spite of your statement to the contrary.’ [53] Ambedkar
was, understandably, not impressed. [54]

So, while modern Hinduism has a much longer lineage than is usually

acknowledged, and while the Hindu identity itself is older than previously
thought, it also incorporates groups that existed until relatively recently on
its peripheries. In this, it creatively borrows missionary strategies. The Arya
Samaj, for example, pursued Dalits despite the risk of violence from
orthodox Hindus horrified by the idea. [55] The threat of rival religions was
amplified to justify change. Or as one leader remarked: ‘The Christian
missionary with his millions is at the door. Mahommedan Mullahs are . . .
rushing to the scene. The Arya Samaj mission alone can save the situation
by taking [Dalits] into the bosom of the Vedic church.’ [56] Dalits, meanwhile,
who accepted their Hinduness were expected to amend several existing
practices, particularly those that provoked high-caste disgust or featured
Muslim influences. In the words of a 1928 pamphlet, ‘[T]hose of you who
circumcise, who marry and bury by Muslim rites, are perpetrating a great
sin.’ [57] These efforts, in great measure, have delivered success: As the
scholar Joel Lee shows, Dalits gave up old names (Rahim for Ram Das),
old gods (though these are worshipped in some secret pockets) and replaced
prior ceremonies with high-caste rites. In Maharashtra, Savarkar’s anticaste reforms also witnessed ‘untouchables’ being vested with the [58]
Brahmin’s sacred thread and taught Sanskrit mantras, with the instruction:
‘Take these holy threads and stop bickering.’ [59]


-----

For Hindu nationalists, in fact, this last word is key. For if there is one

thing that endangers the bottle of modern Hindu political assertion, besides
the missionary, it is internal, caste-based ‘bickering’. Or as a recent verse
addressed to Hindus goes,

The chest is not higher than the shoulder

No caste is bigger than religion.
If the shoulder is lost, what will you do with your chest?

If the religion is lost, what will you do with your caste? [60]

The very fact that a century after Savarkar vivified Hindutva, Hindus must
still be reminded of this reveals certain fragilities.

This book began with the tale of a maharajah, and now it ends with the
travels of another. Four years after Madho Singh of Jaipur journeyed to
Edward VII’s coronation in London, a man called Bijay Chand Mahtab,
maharajah of Burdwan, set out on a tour of Europe. Foreign travel was still
a radical thing for Hindu princes, so much so that on the day of this one’s
departure, his ADC was either abducted by his relations or himself
absconded from fear. Indeed, one of the maharajah’s peers warned that it
was wholly un-Hindu for him to sail; he didn’t even possess the excuse of it
being a ‘Coronation or Jubilee year’ in England to justify the adventure. [61]

But Mahtab was young and determined, and went anyway. And the trip
delivered as expected. It took the Bengali to Italy, France, the Netherlands,
Ireland, Germany, Belgium, and of course, Britain. There was much that
amused the man: electrification in small European towns, encounters with
boisterous American tourists, a gift from the pope of His Holiness’s signed
(and, of course, blessed) photograph, the presence of exclusively handsome
people in Italy, the absence of manly sturdiness in the French, the sight of a
live volcano and the prodigious book-binding budget of the British Library.


-----

Why, he even got to see a whale on the trip, describing it with fitting
princely restraint as a ‘novel experience’. [62]

But it was in the vicinity of Mount Vesuvius in Naples that Mahtab felt

compelled to remark on local religion, becoming that rare thing: a brown
man, in his travelogue, describing a foreign people and their strange ways.
‘The most noticeable fact of all,’ the maharajah sniffed, ‘was the immense
number of churches I saw.’ ‘Every street has a Saint of its own and in every
convenient and possible nook and corner . . . one notices shrines.’ The
Neapolitans were sunk in superstition. If they wanted rain, ‘[y]ou find the
Madonna of such and such a Church taken out amidst bonfires and
fireworks to bring rain’. And if this did not produce a downpour, ‘the people
are told . . . that this particular Madonna has lost her spiritual power, and
such and such a Madonna of such and such [other] place must be sought
for.’ The result was ‘[a]nother procession, more offerings and fire-works’ by
people who ‘meekly submit to all the ceremonies imposed on them by the
Church of Rome’. For Mahtab this was all a ‘rude shock’: The ‘spiritual
guides’ of the Christians, instead of ‘enlightening the flocks, instead of
teaching them the Truth of Religion, in their bigotry, [were] teach[ing] the
people a form of idolatry’. In fact, he added, ‘one may well wonder whether
this be Christianity or Paganism!’—so ‘revolting’ overall that the Hindu
was almost tempted to raise the issue with the pope himself. [63]

Given how Europe’s encounter with India began, one cannot help but

chuckle. Things had, one might even say, come a full circle. But then again,
this is the way of the world. And perhaps god does work in mysterious
ways.

It wasn’t just maharajahs. More ordinary travellers were also keen to
stress that they did not violate any customs abroad. See Pothum

ritual being performed for a caste upgrade was in 1790 in Khaspur,
Assam.
In other versions, a gold vessel called the Padmagarbha (lotuswomb), replaced the cow. See D.D. Kosambi, _An Introduction to the_
_Study of Indian History_ (Bombay: Popular Prakashan, 1975 ed.), p.
318. The cow ceremony was lampooned early on. In the thirteenthcentury _Basavapurana_ , Basava is shown criticizing the caste upgrade
of a tanner. See Velcheru Narayana Rao and Gene H. Roghair (trans.),
_Siva’s Warriors: The Basava Purana of Palkuriki Somanatha_ (New
Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1990), p. 232. On a related note,
there is also the (unverified) story of two envoys sent by the Brahmin
ruler—the Peshwa—of Poona to England. On their return from that
‘polluted’ country, they were made to pass through a gold _yoni_
(representation of the vagina) and restored to their caste following
what was also presumably a ritual rebirth. See James Forbes, _Oriental_
_Memoirs: A Narrative of Seventeen Years Residence in India_
(London: Richard Bentley, 1834), p. 240.
In Travancore, thus, the head and neck of the golden cow went to the
head priest, the front legs and trunk to his juniors, and whatever
remained to temples. See R.P. Raja, _Swathi Thirunal: Through Trails_

I use the term ‘national’ not in the sense of modern nationalism but
Brahminical ideology that attempted to construct narrative unity for
India. In this, I follow Ainslie T. Embree’s essay ‘Brahmanical
Ideology and Regional Identities’, in Embree (Mark Juergensmeyer
ed.), _Imagining India: Essays on Indian History_ (Delhi: Oxford
University Press, 1989), pp. 9–27.
The word ‘Hindu’ is an anachronism for this period, but I use it to
avoid confusion.
For a neat essay on the idea of the kali yuga, see Heinrich von
Stietencron, _Hindu Myth, Hindu History: Religion, Art, and Politics_
(Ranikhet: Permanent Black, 2005), pp. 31–49.
For a history of the Vedic people (who themselves were no monolith)
prior to this move, see Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund, _A_

50.

pp. 64–65. See also Romila Thapar, ‘The Image of the Barbarian in
Early India’, in _Comparative Studies in Society and History_ 13, 4
(1971): 408–36 for a summary of the Brahmin usage of the term
_mlechha_ for groups they encountered, and how, as these were
integrated, the appellation could be withdrawn.
Parasher, ‘Mlecchas’, p. 136. See also P.P. Narayanan Nambudiri,
_Aryans in South India_ (New Delhi: Inter-India Publications, 1992), p.
44. A Brahmin tradition in Bengal also has the community’s ancestors
visit the region to perform Vedic rites, but when they returned to their
homeland, they were treated as outcastes. See Swati Datta, _Migrant_
_Brahmanas in Northern India: Their Settlement and General Impact_
_(C.A.D. 475–1030)_ (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1989), p. 84. Their
descendants came to be known as the Radhiya and Varendra
Brahmins of Bengal. Similarly, as late as the nineteenth century, it
was reported that people who died in Patna, Bihar, were cremated on


-----

the other side of the river—the river being the boundary between an
original Aryan land and a _mleccha-desa_ . See Bholanauth Chunder,
_The Travels of a Hindoo to Various Parts of Bengal and Upper India,_
Vol. 1 (London: N. Trubner & Co., 1869), p. 120. Scottish surgeon
and surveyor Francis Buchanan-Hamilton found immigrant Brahmins
in Bihar stating that it was ‘such an impure country, that, whoever
dies in it becomes an ass’. See Buchanan, _An Account of the Districts_
_of Bihar and Patna in 1811–12_ (Patna: The Bihar and Orissa
Research Society, 1939), p. 321.
See, for example, a seventh-century text cited in Audrey Truschke,
_The Language of History: Sanskrit Narratives of Muslim Pasts_
(Gurugram: Penguin Allen Lane, 2021), p. 31, and Alexis Sanderson,

Early Medieval Period’, p. 42, in Shingo Einoo ed., _Genesis and_
_Development of Tantrism_ (Tokyo: Institute of Oriental Culture, 2009),
pp. 41–350, where we read how any land where the four-fold system
of caste is established becomes pure for Vedic sacrifices.
Even in the modern era, not all parts of India were suitable for these
rituals. There is an oral tradition in Kerala that the kingdom of
Travancore was not ritually pure for Vedic sacrifices ( _yaagam_ s), since
it lay south of the Periyar river. Its maharajahs had to conquer
territory for the privilege of doing a yaagam. In 1788, the maharajah
travelled to Aluva, next to the Periyar, thus, to conduct one. See P.
Shungoonny Menon, _A History of Travancore from the Earliest Times_
(Madras: Higginbotham & Co., 1878), pp. 210–11. On the Vedas and
their evolution, see Frits Staal, _Discovering the Vedas: Origins,_

V.D. Savarkar, _Hindu Rashtra Darshan: A Collection of the_
_Presidential Speeches Delivered from the Hindu Mahasabha Platform_

process as one of ‘colonization and conquest’. This, of course, is an
exaggeration based on now-debunked racial theories about the

Aryans. As Kosambi puts it, the expansion of Brahminical culture
‘spread . . . a new way of living’, rather than a conquest by large
numbers of people. See Kosambi, _An Introduction_ , pp. 113–14.
Parasher, ‘Mlecchas’, p. 25. See also Patrick Olivelle, ‘Social and
literary History of Dharmasastra’, p. 19 in Olivelle and Donald R.
Davis eds., _The Oxford History of Hinduism: Hindu Law: A New_
_History of Dharmasastra_ (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018),
pp. 15–29, where we read that Brahminical claims were less a
reflection of reality, more an attempt to ‘shape’ it. Importantly, nonBrahmin sources, such as Emperor Ashoka’s inscriptions, are
‘completely silent’ on the four _varna_ s (social classes), though the
term ‘Brahmin’ is used.
As Sanderson, ‘The Saiva Age’, p. 115 notes, even those who
supported Buddhists and others maintained Brahminical ideas on
order, which served kings well. And as Dutch indologist Johannes
Bronkhorst observes, much of Brahminism’s success comes from its
transformation into a ‘socio-political ideology’ as opposed to a
religion. See Bronkhorst, _How the Brahmins Won: From Alexander to_
_the Guptas_ (Leiden: Brill, 2016), pp. 3–4.
Bronkhorst quotes inscriptions from around India, thus, between the
first and tenth centuries CE where Brahmins are granted land for rites
to protect the king, bring victory and so on. See Johannes Bronkhorst,
_Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism_ (Leiden: Brill, 2011), pp.
80–84. It has also been noted that even early Vedic literature
primarily focuses on concerns of priests and male warriors, again
suggesting the importance of this equation. See Jan Gonda, _Aspects of_
_Early Visnuism_ (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1969), p. 6. For a
relatively late example from the sixteenth century where a newly
constituted ruler obtains divine origins and Kshatriya rank from
Brahmins, see K.L. Barua, _Early History of Kamarupa: From the_
_Earliest Times to the End of the Sixteenth Century_ (Shillong: K.L.
Barua, 1933), pp. 287–88.

218, in Vincent L. Wimbush ed., _Theorizing Scriptures: New Critical_
_Orientations to a Cultural Phenomenon_ (New Brunswick: Rutgers
University Press, 2008), pp. 214–19. Interestingly, the Mahabharata
declares that many Kshatriyas were _reduced_ to Sudra status because
they had no Brahmins among them—the presence of Brahmins was
critical to Kshatriyahood. See Bronkhorst, _Buddhism_ , pp. 32–33. For
another affirmation, see Patrick Olivelle (trans. & ed.),
_Dharmasutras: The Law Codes of Apastamba, Gautama,_

and human beings.’ See also Bhikhu Parekh, ‘Some Reflections on
the Hindu Tradition of Political Thought’, p. 23, in Thomas Pantham
and Kenneth L. Deutsch eds., _Political Thought in Modern India_
(New Delhi: SAGE Publications, 1986), pp. 17–31, where we read
how ‘almost the entire Hindu tradition of political thought was based
on the unquestioned assumption of a close alliance between the two
highest castes’.

‘This dialectic of mutual construction—Brahmins conferring the
status of Ksatriyahood on kings and the Ksatriyas making Brahmins
powerful by their patronage—is predominantly the story of Brahmin
ideology in premodern India.’
I do not digress here into other philosophies such as of the Carvakas

_Ashoka_ , pp. 293–94. See also ibid., p. 159, pp. 240–41. The
Brahmin–Sramana issue is complex. I do not delve into it, but for
some complexities, overlaps and issues, see Nathan McGovern, _The_
_Snake and the Mongoose: The Emergence of Identity in Early Indian_
_Religion_ (New York: Oxford University Press, 2019). It is also
interesting that the eleven disciples of the principal Jain _tirthankara_
(teacher) Mahavira are supposed to have been Brahmins—a hint of
Jainism’s claims to superiority over the disciples’ original tradition.
On Hinduism as a missionary faith, see Arvind Sharma, _Hinduism as_
_a Missionary Religion_ (Albany: State University of New York Press,
2011).
Mahapadma Nanda, who usurped the Magadhan throne in the fourth
century bce, is described in later Sanskrit texts as ‘destroyer of all
Kshatriyas’. See Kulke and Rothermund, _History of India_ , p. 59.
As Sharma notes, the _Manusmriti_ refers to Yavanas (Greeks), Sakas
(Indo–Scythians) and other alien groups as ‘Kshatriyas (who) have
gradually sunk in this world to the condition of Sudras’ by the
‘omission of the sacred rites’ and for ‘not consulting’ Brahmins. This
opened the door for the recognition and placement of foreign groups
into the Brahmin world view, albeit at an inferior level. See Sharma,
_Hinduism as a Missionary Religion_ , p. 82.
See Thapar, _Early India_ , p. 131, and Kulke and Rothermund, _History_
_of India_ , p. 48. See also Johannes Bronkhorst, _Greater Magadha:_
_Studies in the Culture of Early India_ (Leiden: Brill, 2007), pp. 16–28

Veda—the youngest of the four—we find Vedic deities sharing spaces
with ‘folk’ gods. See Vasudeva S. Agrawala, _Ancient Indian Folk_

new groups when encountered were also thrown into the Sudra
category, allowing space within the Brahmin world view, but at an
inferior level.
It is also interesting that in subsequent tales in the Puranic texts,
Vishnu (and his avatars) and Siva are shown as triumphing in various
ways over Indra—a version of Indra very different from the
triumphant Vedic Indra.
This is leaving aside a possible Greek connection with Dionysus,
discussed by Alain Danielou in _Gods of Love and Ecstasy: The_
_Traditions of Shiva and Dionysus_ (Rochester: Inner Traditions, 1992
ed.), who sees more than coincidence in the shared phallic
iconography, emphasis on mountain abodes and so on.

_from 200_ bc _to_ ad _500_ (New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 1980
ed.), p. 51, where she observes how in the Vedas, Vishnu was ‘a deity
of the fourth rank’. Jaiswal adds that the new Vishnu was himself a
composite of other gods such as Narayana and Krishna–Vasudeva.

Kulke and Rothermund, _History of India_ , p. 47. Indeed, the other
marriages of the Pandavas with the so-called demons (like Hidimbi),
Nagas (like Ulupi) and Yadavas (like Subhadra) also indicate nonAryan alliances.
On the shift from the Vedic religion to Puranic Hinduism, Louis
Renou wrote:

especially Hindu cult-practice and speculation, is not a
large one; Vedic influence on mythology is rather

stronger, though here also there has been a profound
regeneration. Religious terminology is almost
completely transformed between the Vedas and the
Epics or the Puranas a fact which has not been
sufficiently emphasized; the old terms have disappeared
or have so changed in meaning that they are hardly
recognizable; a new terminology comes into being.
Even in those cases where continuity has been
suggested, as for Rudra-Siva, the differences are really
far more striking than similarities.

Renou quoted in Asko Parpola, _The Roots of Hinduism: The Early_
_Aryans and the Indus Civilization_ (New Delhi: Oxford University
Press), p. 4. Or as Bibek Debroy puts it, the ‘general understanding
and practise of _dharma_ ’ as we know it today ‘is based much more on
the Puranas than on the Vedas’. See Debroy (trans.), _Shiva Purana_ ,

F.E. Pargiter, _Ancient Indian Historical Tradition_ (London: Oxford

more political terms, as ‘tampering’ with knowledge in a way that
reshaped it ‘according to Brahmanic ideas’.

The Chellur (Perumchellur) settlement of Namboodiri Brahmins in
Kerala, at present-day Taliparamba, for example, was in existence at
the dawn of the Christian era. See Kesavan Veluthat, _Brahman_
_Settlements in Kerala: Historical Studies_ (Calicut: Sandhya
Publications, 1978), p. 3. In the south, the Pallava kings in this period
were also influenced by Brahminical culture, helping its spread.

the Bhagavata and Pancharatra traditions, which in the _Kurmapurana_

feature many ‘of doubtful historicity’ and were possibly ‘fictitious’
and ‘added to make up the number sixty-three which was directly
borrowed’ from the Jain idea of sixty-three illustrious beings. See R.

gloss. A Ramayana story about a king who desired to go to heaven
with his body intact was modified; where in the original, he went

Wendy Doniger, ‘The Scrapbook of Undeserved Salvation: The
Kedara Khanda of the Skanda Purana’, pp. 59–60, in Doniger ed.,
_Purana Perennis_ , pp. 59–84. Doniger is not alone in this: Centuries
before, the _Narayansabdanirukti_ also observed that ‘fabricated texts
on the greatness of sacred centers, which concern modern temples
and other sites, are being composed and attributed precisely to the
Skanda Purana’. Quoted in Elaine M. Fisher, _Hindu Pluralism:_
_Religion and the Public Sphere in Early Modern South India_
(Oakland: University of California Press, 2017), p. 127. The Puranas
themselves would be graded in descending order as _satv_ ic (pure),
_rajas_ ic (passionate) and _tamas_ ic (dark), with the _Skandapurana_ in the
last category.

that the Vedic tradition disappeared. To quote Hermann W. Tull,

rather, are akin to strands that converge and diverge, historically and

Some of the puritanical ritualism associated with Brahmins might
also have its origins here. To borrow a scholar’s words from another
context, minorities, to avoid being ‘swallowed up’ by the majority
around them, develop ‘a multitude of contradistinctive customs—
such as purity laws’. See Jan Assmann, _Of God and Gods: Egypt,_

Not that in earlier periods there was no resistance to this Puranic turn.
Evidently, Brahmins who preferred the older Vedic tradition looked
down on their fellows who adapted and embraced the Puranas. The
latter were viewed as ‘having fallen away from the highest brahmanic
standard’. There was ‘clear rivalry on the part of the Puranas with the
Vedas’. See Pargiter, _Ancient Indian Historical Tradition,_ pp. 29–30.

See S.K. Pillai, ‘The Sacred Palmyra Grove’, in _India International_

Freeman, ‘The Literature of Hinduism in Malayalam’, pp. 163–64, in
Gavin Flood ed., _The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism_ (Oxford:
Blackwell Publishing, 2003), pp. 159–81. Violence also was in play.
Brahmin legends themselves hint at painful encounters. As Thapar
notes in _Early India_ , p. 56, the Mahabharata speaks of the clearing of
the Khandava forest by fire to establish a settlement, describing
forest-people as demons. In Kerala, Brahmin tradition notes that a
first immigration failed, while the second one succeeded. Reference
to 36,000 arms-bearing Brahmins, even if an exaggeration, hints at
more than diplomacy in play. See Veluthat, _Brahman Settlements_ , p.
4, and Nambudiri, _Aryans in South India_ , p. 145. In the same region,
the _Sri Vallabha Kshetra Mahatmyam_ tells of a ‘demon’ who

prevented Brahmins from living in a region and had to be killed by a
Vishnu avatar—a reference possibly to a tribal ruler. See V. Raghavan
Nambyar, ‘Annals and Antiquities of Tiruvalla’, pp. 87–89, in _Kerala_
_Society Papers_ , Vol. 1, Series 2 (Thiruvananthapuram: Government
of Kerala, 1997 ed.), pp. 57–94.
Among Namboodiris, for example, the Brahmins are divided as
Othulla and Othillatha, based on who was permitted Vedic
knowledge. On food, Saraswat Brahmins ate fish, while meat was
consumed by Brahmins living in the Himalayan foothills.
Burial, for instance, is followed by Aradhya Brahmins in Andhra. See
Nambudiri, _Aryans in South India_ , p. 75.
These Brahmins of Payyannur were later deemed degraded, though
their own logic for accepting matriliny is not that it was a concession
to local customs, but that Parasurama—the Vishnu avatar who created
Kerala—urged it to expiate his sin of matricide. See Veluthat,
_Brahman Settlements_ , p. 22. On adapting local customs the
‘colonists’, a twentieth-century retelling explains, ‘conciliated the
natives by . . . adopting some of their usages and practices, while,
wherever they went, they diffused around them a halo of higher
civilization’. See C. Achyuta Menon, _The Cochin State Manual_

_Myths, Rites, and Attitudes_ (Chicago: The University of Chicago
Press, 1968), pp. 23–40, which has arguments against Bhagavatas by
Smarta Brahmins. Here, the Smarta complains that ‘crooks’ and
Sudras, by appropriating Brahmin marks and symbols, were claiming
Brahmin status.
Reference is to the Shenoys. See Madhav M. Deshpande, ‘Ksatriyas
in the Kali Age? Gagabhatta & His Opponents’, pp. 96–97, in _IndoIranian Journal_ 53, 2 (2010): 95–120.
There was only one varna, that is, of Brahmins. But within this varna
—or caste category—many _jati_ s, sub-castes, existed. The same is true
of non-Brahmin groups also, and often politically ascendant jatis
might claim a higher varna status.
In Bastar, thus, a fifteenth-century king brought Brahmins from
Orissa ‘to spread settled agriculture’ while even the Sangam poetry of
Arisil Kizhar praises a Chera king for transforming his kingdom
‘which abounded in thick forests’ by bringing in Brahmins. See
Nandini Sundar, _Subalterns and Sovereigns: An Anthropological_
_History of Bastar, 1854_ – _1996_ (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1997),

from primitive agriculture to advanced, organized systems was not,
however, always peaceful or welcomed by locals. See, for example,

Buchanan, surveying Bihar for the East India Company in the early

wife. See Buchanan, _Bihar_ , p. 362.

Friedhelm Hardy, for example, argues that the _Bhagavatapurana_ ,
which spread out through India with its intense devotionalism for
Krishna, was a Sanskritized version of what originated in the poetry
of the Tamil Vaishnava saints, itself, inspired by stories received from
the North. See Hardy, _Viraha-Bhakti: The Early History of Krsna_

See Bronkhorst, _How the Brahmins Won_ , p. 111 and Bronkhorst,

that was Brahminism.
As Copland et al., _History of State and Religion_ , p. 66 note,

. . . with their legends, their lists of past kings mingling
real people with mythical figures, and their associations
with notable sacred sites, the Puranas provided
‘cosmological charters’, certifying, for each
community, its unique place in the universe; in this way,
people’s loyalties to local gods and shrines became

the laity with pilgrimages and other activities.
Thapar, _Early India_ , p. 275.
Compare for instance the _Brihaddharmapurana_ and the
_Padmapurana_ . His critics who saw him as a ‘crypto-Buddhist’
included Ramanuja of the eleventh century. See Thapar, _Early India_ ,
p. 349, where she notes how Sankara’s practical techniques with its
monasteries etc. were influenced by Sramanic groups. See also

To be clear, Sankara did allow image worship, but as an intermediate
technique.
As Richard Davis tells, Sramanic religions first began to make figures
of their founders and other divinities around the first century CE ,
within a century of which we find images of Hindu gods appearing
(though references to images used in worship evidently appear in
older sources such as Panini’s _Ashtadhyayi_ and Patanjali’s
_Mahabhasya_ several centuries bce). By the fifth century CE , Sanskrit
texts spoke of practical and ceremonial elements around image

Sanderson, ‘The Saiva Age’, p. 115 thus cites a royal inscription
where the ruler is a Buddhist who yet ‘ensured that members of the
caste-classes and disciplines observed their prescribed roles’.
Bronkhurst, _Buddhism_ , pp. 41–42 also notes that kings were not
obliged to accept the ‘whole package’ when it came to religion,
choosing whatever ‘services’ suited them. Stein in ‘All the King’s
Mana’, pp. 156–57 adds that Jainism’s decline may have been
because kings found the Brahmin alternative more politically
advantageous. A more concrete example comes from Nepal where
King Jayasthiti Malla in the fourteenth century, aided by Brahmins
from India, established caste among the Newars. See Stephen
Michael Greenwold, ‘Kingship and Caste’, pp. 55–56, in _European_
_Journal of Sociology_ 16, 1 (Observer’s Analysis of Caste and
Clientele) (1975): 49–75.
See Kesavan Veluthat, ‘The Temple-Base of the Bhakti Movement’
for more on this in the context of the Pallava dynasty. See also
Geoffrey A. Oddie, _Hindu and Christian in South-East India_ (London
Studies on South Asia) (London: Curzon Press, 1991) for numbers
from an 1818 report that show three major Tamil temples together
employing 1173 persons, including priests, dancers, musicians,
potters, lamplighters, cow-keepers, security staff, suppliers, etc.

Richard H. Davis, _The Bhagavad Gita: A Biography_ (Princeton:

In a similar sense, tradition ascribes the ‘rediscovery’ of lost holy
spots in Braj (associated with the deity Krishna) in upper India to
Vallabhacharya, who came from Andhra in the south and whose
followers in the Pushtimarga school of bhakti are now spread
primarily in western India. See Charlotte Vaudeville, ‘Braj, Lost and
Found’, in _Indo–Iranian Journal_ 18, 3 _–_ 4 (1976): 195 _–_ 213.

Geography placed barriers in the formation of a homogenized
religion, and yet it was possible for such barriers to be surmounted.
And in time this would also be used to assert India’s right to political
unity. See, for example, K.M. Panikkar, _Indian Nationalism: Its_
_Origin, History, and Ideals_ (London: The Faith Press, 1920), p. 8. See
also Rabindranath Tagore, _Nationalism_ (San Francisco: The Book
Club of California, 1817), p. 137, where he describes Hinduism as ‘a
United States of a social federation’.
Indira Viswanathan Peterson, _Poems to Siva: The Hymns of the Tamil_
_Saints_ (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1989), p. 4. Pali and
Prakrit, as Viswanathan Peterson points out, were used by Buddhists
and Jains, but in the broad category of Hindus, it was Tamil that first
produced religious literature outside Sanskrit.
Devadevan, _Prehistory_ , pp. 40–41.
Devadevan’s research shows at least 170 temples to have been
constructed in eight _taluk_ s of Karnataka between 1000 and 1200 CE ,
out of its total of 240-odd taluks.
Ramanujan, _Speaking of Siva_ , p. 19.
Ibid., p. 25
Ibid., pp. 53–54. The Hindi scholar Hazariprasad Dwivedi described
it as the _bhakti andolan_ . ‘Andolan’ means both ‘movement’ as in
bhakti movement as well as ‘protest’. Of course, the matter is more
complicated. See John Stratton Hawley, Christian Lee Novetzke and
Swapna Sharma eds., _Bhakti and Power: Debating India’s Religion of_
_the Heart_ (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2019).
This is why it is odd to refer to bhakti as one ‘movement’. See John
Stratton Hawley, _A Storm of Songs: India and the Idea of the Bhakti_
_Movement_ (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2015). Or to cite
another scholar, ‘Bhakti can range from sober respect and veneration
that upholds socioreligious hierarchies and distinctions to fervent
emotional enthusiasm that breaks down all such hierarchies and
distinctions in a radical soteriological egalitarianism. Bhakti is not
one single thing.’ See Cort, ‘Bhakti in the Early Jain Tradition’, p. 62.

Chola ruler, while the Jain-turned-Vaishnava is a Hoysala king. In the

successfully gets a Pandya king in Tamil country to renounce Saivism

are treated as liars and peddlers of falsehoods.
Quoted in Truschke, _Language of History_ , p. 128. Segregating
Hindus this way—despite internal inconsistencies—from Jains and
Buddhists is not a new trend: in the seventeenth-century _Dabistan-iMazahib_ of the Mughal court, as Irfan Habib tells, the author was
‘hard put to describe what the beliefs of a Hindu are and ultimately he
takes shelter in a very convenient position but the only position—
Hindus are those who have been arguing with each other within the
same framework of argument over the centuries’. Of course, in this
text, Jains, given their debates with Brahmins, are classed as Hindus,
and it is the Muslim who is outside because they do not ‘share any
basic terminology with the others’. See Satish Chandra, J.S. Grewal

townspeople transfer their loyalties to Jainism. See Umamaheshwari,

wrong. As Benjamin B. Cohen shows in his study of Hyderabad,
under a topsoil of Islamic rule, subordinate Hindu dynasties survived
all the way from the medieval period till the mid-twentieth century.
See Cohen, _Kingship and Colonialism in India’s Deccan, 1850_ – _1948_
(New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007). See also Wolseley Haig, _The_
_Cambridge History of India, Vol. III: Turks and Afghans_ (Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1928), p. 4, where he notes that even
with the first Islamic campaigns in Sindh, this was treated ‘not [as] a
holy war for the propagation of the faith, but a mere war of conquest’.
In Delhi, by the reign of Muhammad bin Tughluq in the fourteenth
century, the king showed favour to Jains, and at the installation of his
successor, Brahmins had the honour of paying obeisance in person.
Even in the previous century, sultans adopted several Hindu practices
and though formally no new temples were to be built, this was not the
case. However, it was possible to flip to intolerance if a specific ruler
were ill-disposed. See Jackson, _Delhi Sultanate_ , pp. 280–95. On Jain
memories of these sultans, see Steven M. Vose, ‘Jain Memory of the

It seems fairly clear that, traditionally in India, people
readily transferred or distributed their allegiance
between different sects, seeing no logical inconsistency
in approaching different gods for different purposes,
and that this apparently syncretic style of religious
behaviour encouraged a relaxed attitude of what others
did as well.

the Tamil Cirappuranam’, pp. 77–81, in Gilmartin and Lawrence eds.,
_Beyond Turk and Hindu_ , pp. 74–97. In seventeenth-century Bengal, a
Muslim text, the _Nabibamsa_ , cast Vishnu, Siva and other Hindu
deities as prophets of god, succeeded in time by the Prophet. See
Eaton, _Bengal Frontier_ , pp. 285–90. This business of claiming
Western religions as ‘originally’ Hindu has seen modern proponents
too: P.N. Oak (1917–2007) claimed that the Vatican and even
Westminster Abbey were originally Hindu temples.
James Laine, _Shivaji: Hindu King in Islamic India_ (New York:
Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 43. It may be tempting to
demarcate the Hindu–Muslim encounter along political clashes at
kingly levels and syncretic experiences below. But even this is
simplistic. For there were sultans too who admired Hindu culture.
One in Bijapur styled himself son of the Hindu gods Ganapati and
Sarasvati, not unlike those medieval kings who supported Brahmins
and Buddhists alike. See Pillai, _Rebel Sultans_ , p. 132. Even Mahmud
Begada (1459–1511), a Gujarat sultan who sacked Somnath, is in
Sanskrit poetry lionised as Vishnu-like; the goddess Sarasvati
abandons heaven to reside in his superior country. See Aparna

105, pp. 122–23. Interestingly, the term _turuska_ (Turk) associated
with Muslims, was applied to _Hindus_ who defied norms: King Harsha
in twelfth-century Kashmir was branded as such for his iconoclasm.
And when in the fifteenth century a Muslim promoted Brahmins, he
was eulogized as descended from Hindu heroes! See Truschke,
_Language of History_ , pp. 90–94. See also Satoshi Ogura,
‘Incompatible Outsiders or Believers of a Darsana? Representations
of Muslims by Three Brahmans of Sahamirid Kasmir’, in _Rivista_
_degli studi orientali_ , New Series 88, 1/4 (2015): 179–211, and Wagle,
‘Hindu-Muslim interactions’, pp. 137–39. The term ‘sultan’ too, to a
degree, lost religious connotations: Vijayanagara’s kings were styled
_hinduraya suratrana_ , ‘sultans among Hindu kings’. See Pillai, _Rebel_
_Sultans_ , p. 80.
Sheikh, _Forging a Region_ , p. 111 cites a twelfth-century text where
the Chalukya king’s Chudasama enemy is described as a demon born
of a mleccha mother. ‘He takes away the cows of the sages . . . kills
Brahmans, spoils sacrifices . . . and demands money and taxes of the
ascetics.’ See also Divya Cherian, _Merchants of Virtue: Hindus,_
_Muslims, and Untouchables in Eighteenth-Century South Asia_
(Oakland: University of California Press, 2023), where we find the
term ‘Hindu’ used to not just demarcate certain castes from Muslims,
but also from lower-caste groups.
This continued even in the eighteenth century when, Martanda Varma
of Travancore, for instance, attacked temples and seized their
treasures, and in 1802 when the Maratha (Holkar) ruler of Indore
plundered temple towns in Rajasthan, with deities in Nathdwara even
going into temporary exile. See Mark de Lannoy, _The Kulasekhara_

plundered Hindus but also local Muslims in the areas under attack.
See Jackson, _Delhi Sultanate_ , p. 208.

Encounter between Hindu and Muslim: Eknath’s Drama-Poem Hindu

Eknath: Two Bhakti Modes of Legitimacy for Modern Change’, p.
149, in Lele ed., _Tradition and Modernity_ , pp. 136–56. Kabir also
clearly identified Hindus as a community. See Purushottam Agrawal,
_Kabir, Kabir: The Life and Work of the Early Modern Poet_
_Philosopher_ (Chennai: Westland Publications, 2021), pp. 86–87.
Malik Muhammad Jayasi makes a similar distinction in the sixteenth
century. See Purushottam Agrawal, _Padmavat: An Epic Love Story_
(New Delhi: Rupa Publications, 2018), p. 25. So also we find in the
Mughal court a division between Hindus and Muslims. See Ernst,
‘Muslim Studies’, pp. 180–82.
We will in chapters ahead see more on Brahmins and their links not
just with Muslim powers but also, in time, the British. On Persian,
this was soon Indianized, of course, and became the language of
diplomatic correspondence and transregional communication even
among Hindu powers until the nineteenth century.
See for instance Jaiswal, ‘Semitising Hinduism’, p. 24. See also
Eaton, _Bengal Frontier_ , p. 38 for how at first ordinary people denied
legitimacy to Islamic power, even after having lived under it for
decades.
This comes across in the _Rajaramacarita_ . In it we read: ‘How will
men find peace in this ghastly Kali Yuga/That is bringing on the
victory of the great Mughals (mlecchas)/Everywhere the Mughal king
destroys class boundaries ( _varnadharmavighatin_ )/Every field of
dharma has been destroyed by that bad-souled man.’ Quoted in

This is visible also in the increasing usage of the term ‘Hindu’—
hitherto a generic expression for Indians—as a signifier of religious
identity. Recorded first in the ninth century, it occurs sparsely
thereafter. But between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, in
Bengal alone variants of ‘Hindu’ appear forty-eight times in sectarian
texts. For a history of the term ‘Hindu’ and its evolving meanings, see
Audrey Truschke, ‘Hindu: A History’, in _Comparative Studies in_
_Society and History_ 65, 2 (2023): 246–71. See also Copland et al., pp.

To avoid entangling the reader in too many knots, I do not here
venture into the debate on ‘religion’ itself as a concept which might
or might not be translatable universally and across cultures. In any
case, to quote one scholar, Indian thinkers in the nineteenth century
did show an ‘implicit understanding of religion as a universally
applicable concept’. See Arvind-Pal S. Mandair, _Religion and the_
_Specter of the West: Sikhism, India, Postcoloniality, and the Politics_
_of Translation_ (New York: Columbia University Press, 2009), p. 53.

That controversial ideas were expressed is not in doubt. Years later,
when the third mission complained that the emperor was not taking
them seriously, Akbar reminded them that ‘he had at least done this
much for the Fathers that, whereas under former rulers they could not
have dared to affirm the divinity of Christ, they could now do so with
perfect safety’. See Maclagan, _The Jesuits and the Great Mogul_ , p.

The fact that sati stones were erected to commemorate women who
burned themselves is a sign that it was not an everyday affair. Its
occurrence was rare enough for individual satis to be memorialized.
So too the process, where, as one traveller put it, there was ‘the
Country Musick . . . a great many Maids and Women, singing and
dancing before the Widow’ alongside a ‘company of Men, Women,
and Children’ in a procession, suggests that it was a special enough
occurrence to be celebrated in this extremely public manner. We also
find Henry Lord in _A Display of Two Forraigne Sects in the East_
_Indies_ (London, 1630), p. 68 noting that sati was performed by
‘persons of greater worth’ though its ‘examples be more rare now’.
Colonial officials like H.T. Colebrooke in the 1790s also spoke of its
rareness. See H.T. Colebrooke, _Essays on the Religion and_

The Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Abdali in the eighteenth century was
horrified when an Indian ally brought an army of sadhus to the
battlefield. An account from the time poses the question: ‘How could
the Kaffirs [infidels] have so much liberty as to walk with their things
and buttocks exposed before the Moslems?’ Quoted in Ira Mukhoty,
_The Lion and the Lily: The Rise and Fall of Awadh_ (New Delhi:
Aleph Book Company, 2024), p. 35.
Sadhus would in the colonial future also serve as agents of antiBritish sentiment. As was written: ‘With absolute freedom to go
where they will, with access to all quarters, with fellow initiates in
every town their powers of underground propaganda may be very
great, and their power for evil serious.’ Quoted in Kim A. Wagner,
_The Great Fear of 1857: Rumours, Conspiracies and the Making of_
_the Indian Uprising_ (Oxford: Peter Lang, 2010), p. xix.
Nineteenth-century British accounts were more sober, stating that
there were perfectly decent sadhus just as there were offensive ones
—there was no one standard for the whole lot. See Elphinstone, _A_
_History of India_ , Vol. 1, p. 118.

A whiff of these stereotypes—and their long life—appears even in
Karl Marx’s nineteenth-century summarization of Hinduism, for
instance, as ‘at once a religion of sensualist exuberance, and a
religion of self-torturing asceticism; a religion of the Lingam and the
Juggernaut; the religion of the Monk, and of the Bayadere [temple

the cliché of climate creating an ‘enervating’ situation in India
continued, for instance in the writings of Henry Kissinger. Indians
were not immune either. In a speech in 1913, the technocrat minister
M. Visvesvaraya of Mysore State repeated the myth when he said, ‘In
our warm climate we have not got the same incentive to exertion and
we may never be able to attain the same level of prosperity as

had business interests, of course, but the sea was not thought of as a
militarized space that required land powers to project power. Or as
Reddy observes, ‘The Mughal state was so disinterested with the sea
that by the mid-seventeenth century [Emperor] Aurangzeb finally
outsourced his naval needs.’ See Srinivas Reddy, ‘Disrupting Mughal
Imperialism: Piracy and Plunder on the Indian Ocean’, p. 130, in

should not be surprising. Even among the Mughals, Emperor Jahangir
allowed the conversion of his nephews (sons of Akbar’s son Daniyal).
These princes took Portuguese names: Tahmurs became Dom Filipe,
Baisunghar became Dom Carlos and Hoshang became Dom
Henrique. To the aggravation of the Jesuits, once relations with the
Portuguese soured, the princes apostatized and became Muslims
again. See Flores, _The Mughal Padshah_ , p. 17, p. 92.

_and the Imagination of Empire in Early Modern Brazil and India_
(New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2018), p. 45. This is not
surprising: in Kerala, where the Portuguese demanded the expulsion
of Arab traders, the Hindu rajah of Calicut refused. However, the only
local _Muslim_ royal house on the coast aligned with them. From their
perspective, this was a form of insurance against Calicut’s
dominance. Thus, domestic politics in Kerala guided how the
Portuguese were received. See Mahmood Kooria, ‘An Abode of
Islam’, p. 94.

converted willingly also. Priolkar, _Goa Inquisition_ , p. 56 notes a 1567

converted with her to Christianity. See also Robinson, ‘Sixteenth

Balakrishna from Udayagiri brought to Hampi by Emperor
Krishnadevaraya, and to Vitthal of Pandharpur—this latter was
returned.

Thus, during feuds with priests of the famous Padmanabhaswamy
Temple, the Travancore rajahs were not above burning down its gate
and attacking them. Expiatory gifts were later made. See A.
Gopalakrishna Menon, _History of Sri Padmanabsvami Temple Till_
_1758_ (Thiruvananthapuram: Menon & Co., 1996), p. 22, p. 122, p.
128, p. 138. Even the conquest of territories under rival Hindu rulers
involved temple desecration: in the eighteenth century, Martanda
Varma of Travancore burned ‘churches, pagodas, and palaces’ in a
rival’s state, while his troops in one case were beaten up with brooms
by priests when they attempted to appropriate its property. See Mark
de Lannoy, _The Kulasekhara Perumals of Travancore_ , p. 55, p. 123,
p. 126.
Or as a scholar puts it in the context of another part of the world,
there can be an ‘intrasystemic’ Other (as in the case of Hindus
clashing) and ‘extrasystemic’ ones (Hindus versus Muslims) where
the Other operates within a ‘different construction of reality’. To
intrasystemic rivals, these were still gods; to the extrasystemic, they
were ‘mere pieces of wood or stone’. See Assman, _Of God and Gods_ ,
p. 31.
Davis, _Lives of Indian Images_ , p. 129.
The _Vimanarcanakalpa_ quoted in ibid., pp. 127–28. Even when idols
were destroyed, they could be ‘found’. As Jahangir once observed
sardonically, Brahmins conveniently ‘dreamed’ of the locations of
hidden images—planted there in advance—and consecrated these in
place of what was destroyed. See _Jahangirnama_ , p. 375.

(Heda was Dutch, and his remarks might be tinted with antiPortuguese and Protestant prejudice.) Meanwhile, Hindu attitudes
only made Jesuits more paranoid. Alarmed at the ease with which
locals created gods, even a Portuguese grandee’s statue caused fear
that some might ‘adore it’. See Flores and Marcocci, ‘Killing
Images’, p. 465. See also Alden, _The Making of an Enterprise_ , p. 77,

Susan Bayly highlights an old hagiography of St Thomas where he is
supposed to have come to Taxila in the north-west of India. From
there, it travelled to southern India and was ‘simply . . . transformed
to fit the local sacral landscape’. See Bayly, _Saints_ , _Goddesses and_
_Kings_ , p. 244. Frykenberg, meanwhile, notes how when St Thomas
Christians were confronted with lack of clear evidence about St
Thomas’s coming to Malabar, they pointed out that there was no
evidence for St Peter having come to Rome either.

They did seek a friendly alliance, only for de Gama, when presented
a staff, to misunderstand the gesture as a mark of submission. Note,
however, that as early as 1329, Pope John XXII had created a
Catholic diocese in Quilon in Malabar, with the traveller Jordanus
Catalani as its bishop, after John of Montecorvino informed Rome of
the existence of a Christian community in the region. At this time,

relations with St Thomas Christians were friendly. On the Christians
seeking Portuguese protection, especially in 1523, see Robert Eric
Frykenberg, ‘Christians in India: An Historical Overview of their
Complex Origins’, p. 40, in Robert Eric Frykenberg ed., _Christians_
_and Missionaries in India: Cross-Cultural Communication since_
_1500_ (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company,
London: Routledge, 2003), pp. 33–61.
Bayly, _Saints, Goddesses and Kings_ , p. 266. Things also got heated
because the Church of the East, meanwhile, was split after a schism,
with one section entering into communion with Rome. This internal
strife may have encouraged the Portuguese to claim the Nasranis for
the pro-Rome faction. See also Neill, _Christianity in India_ , pp. 196–
97, where we read that already by the 1510s and 1520s, due to the
insistence of certain Portuguese priests that Nasranis abandon all
aspects alien to Catholics, there was ill-feeling.

Archbishop Alexio de Menezes quoted in ibid, Appendix: ‘The
Publication and Calling of the Synod’.
Bayly, _Saints, Goddesses and Kings_ , pp. 252–53. One special
privilege the St Thomas Christians enjoyed was that only their
‘touch’ could purify oil and ghee used in Hindu temples and highcaste households. These customs continued into the twentieth century.
See Aiya, _The Travancore State Manual_ , Vol. 2, p. 123, where we
also read that some Nasrani women dressed like Brahmin women, as
a mark of descent from Brahmin converts made by
St Thomas.

See Neill, _Christianity in India_ , pp. 316–19. Known as Ahatallah, the
man’s antecedents are complicated, but for the Nasranis, the idea that
they had been sent a bishop from the Church of the East was a
catalyst.
This was through the famous Coonan Cross Oath of 3 January 1653.
See Frykenberg, ‘Christians in India’, p. 42. See also James
Puliurumpil, _Glimpses of Syro-Malabar History_ (Kottayam: Oriental
Institute of Religious Studies, 2019), pp. 85–101. Under pressure
from British missionaries in the nineteenth century, where they tried
to draw Nasranis close to the Protestant Church of England, there
would be a reaffirmation of links with Antioch by Nasranis resisting
this. See van der Ploeg, _The Christians of St Thomas_ , p. 35.

there, while not as forceful as in Goa, put in place ‘a system of

colonial mentality’.
Maria Jose Ferro quoted in Xavier, _Religion and Empire_ , p. 91. Or as
occurred in a French-ruled enclave in 1746, where Hindus protesting
the desecration of a temple said, when coerced into dispersing: ‘Why
do you strike us? Cannot people meet, and deliberate when their
religion is at stake . . . Why do you come, and beat us? You had better
kill us all.’ See J. Fredrick Price and K. Rangachari eds., _The Private_

order the expulsion of Hindus from Bardez in North Goa because
‘their presence affected the loyalty of the Christians to their religion’.
See P.S. Pissurlencar (T.V. Parvate trans.), _Portuguese Mahratta_
_Relations_ (Bombay: Maharashtra State Board for Literature and
Culture, 1983), p. 47. Similar complaints were made even in the
1630s, suggesting that Hindus showed resilience. As late as 1736, the
Inquisition published an edict banning certain customs and rituals for
converts, suggesting that these ‘Hindu’ customs had tended to
continue. See Rowena Robinson, ‘Taboo or Veiled Consent? Goan
Inquisitorial Edict of 1736’, p. 2423, in _Economic and Political_
_Weekly_ 35, 27 (2000): 2423–31.

At Diu in Gujarat, as early as the 1590s, when the Portuguese
attempted to take a hard-line religious position, the governor replied
that if enacted, ‘everyone would leave and then there would be no
trade here’. Quoted in M.N. Pearson, _Merchants and Rulers in_
_Gujarat: The Response to the Portuguese in the Sixteenth Century_
(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976),
p. 104. Another cause for the return of tolerance was that at sea
Portuguese dominance was challenged by the Dutch, and on land by
the Hindu Marathas by the end of the seventeenth century, making


-----

stability within Goa expedient. See Xavier, _Religion and Empire_ , p.
276.
As early as 1630, the Goan authorities, already facing declining
income, suggested permitting Hindu weddings again on payment of a
sum. This would make about 3000 cruzados a year. ‘That such a
trifling sum could, even as a proposal, dictate such a major policy
change,’ Pearson observes, ‘is indicative indeed of the Portuguese
government’s financial straits’. See Pearson, _The Portuguese in India_ ,
p. 134. See also D’Costa, _The Christianisation of the Goa Islands_ , p.
68, p. 71, and Xavier, _Religion and Empire_ , pp. 95–96 for criticism of
the hardline policy within the Portuguese camp. See also ibid., p. 228
for how mass desertions by peasants led to economic problems for
the Goa government, which also therefore saw some rules relaxed,
and p. 275. In Kerala too, Portuguese power was ‘strongest in the
coastal regions’ with Nasranis, not in the interiors. See van der Ploeg,
_The Christians of St Thomas_ (Bangalore: Dharmaram, 1983), p. 18.
Henn, _Hindu–Catholic Encounters_ , p. 13. Of course, some of this was
because certain churches stood at the same spot as Hindu sites; so, if
people made offerings once to a goddess, the replacement of the
building with a church led them to continue doing so, now to the
Virgin. See Xavier, _Religion and Empire_ , p. 153. On the relaxation of
earlier rules, Priolkar, _Goa Inquisition_ , p. 29 adds that local dressing
habits, taboos around pork and beef consumption, and other such
‘petty Gentile and Mahomedan superstitions’ were now allowed for
converts. See also Robinson, ‘Negotiating Traditions’, pp. 41–42, p.

Christian identity to claim a more prestigious position for their caste
community within the broader Tamil context. See Rowena Robinson,

_Asian Journal of Social Science_ 37, 1 (2009): 29–54.

This practice of new converts being asked to break images of their
old gods continued even into the twentieth century. See Joel Lee,
_Deceptive Majority: Dalits, Hinduism, and Underground Religion_
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2021), p. 47.
Coleridge, _Life and Letters_ , pp. 279–82. Xavier also had bigger fish
to fry. For the missionary enterprise was not divorced from
Portuguese geopolitical ambitions. In the Sri Lankan kingdom of
Kotte, a rajah put to death a son who wished to convert. Naturally,
wrote Xavier, a miracle followed: ‘The persons present at his
execution declare that they saw a cross of fire in the heavens’, and
even the earth ‘opened in the form of a cross’ (pp. 282–83). While it
was described as a tale of heroic faith, what Xavier obscured was that
all this emerged from Portuguese interventions in the kingdom. Its
ruler, under pressure from a rival, sent an embassy to Lisbon for
military aid. It was also hinted broadly that the rajah might become a
Christian, but when four fathers landed up, he reneged. Watching this,
meanwhile, a son whom the ruler intended to deny the throne, saw an
opening and went to the Portuguese to be baptised—it was this
opportunist whose death generated divine fireworks. In the end, the
rajah was assassinated, a grandson rose to power, and not long
thereafter, having become Christian, the puppet ruler ‘willed’ away
his realm to Portugal. See Subrahmanyam, _The Portuguese Empire_ ,

even the Nasranis came to hate the Jesuits. As we read, they may yet

them at the mercy of Jesuits and the Portuguese. See Neill,

themselves not become Christians, but . . . prevent others also from
doing so . . . They are wholly detrimental to the State . . .’ See another
similar remark in Xavier, _Religion and Empire_ , p. 89.
This might also be linked to the fact that, until direct exposure in the
early modern period, many Europeans had a romanticized idea of
Brahmins from Alexander lore as a ‘people safeguarding Christian
principles in the East’; as an ideal for Christians. On actually meeting
Brahmins, the picture changed. See Raf Gelders, ‘Genealogy of
Colonial Discourse: Hindu Traditions and the Limits of European
Representation’, pp. 571–72, in _Comparative Studies in Society and_
_History_ 51, 3 (2009): 563–89. Equally, however, some early Christian
accounts were also critical of Brahmins already in the third century

CE . See Thomas Hahn, ‘The Indian Tradition in Western Medieval
Intellectual History’, p. 217, in Joan-Pau Rubiés ed., _Medieval_
_Ethnographies: European Perceptions of the World Beyond_
(Abingdon: Routledge, 2009), pp. 209–30. Material for appreciation
and criticism, that is, were both available.

and Zupanov, _Catholic Orientalism_ , pp. 130–31.
Of course, monotheistic ideas existed among some of these pagans
also, especially among the Romans and Greeks, though what this
meant exactly is debated. See, for example, Stephen Mitchell and
Peter Van Nuffelen eds., _One God: Pagan Monotheism in the Roman_
_Empire_ (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), and essays
in Polymnia Athanassiadi and Michael Frede eds., _Pagan_
_Monotheism in Late Antiquity_ (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1999).
An opinion repeated in the seventeenth century by Paulo da Trindade,
a Franciscan missionary. See Xavier and Zupanov, _Catholic_
_Orientalism_ , pp. 185–86. This phenomenon—of recognizing many
gods as aspects of one great god—is these days characterized as
Summodeism.
Quoted in Shulman, _Tamil Temple Myths_ , p. 84. Another nineteenth
century intellectual used the analogy of the forest; god was the forest
while images of gods the trees. See Pennington, _Was Hinduism_
_Invented?_ , pp. 61–62. See also a discussion on the
_Vishnudharmottara_ and its apology for image worship in Phyllis
Granoff, ‘Reading between the lines: Colliding attitudes towards

Of course, this did not mean that many did believe the opposite. As a
later critic would write,

This decided taste for allegory, which is characteristic
of the founders of the Hindu religion and polity, has
proved the source of many errors in the case of a people
who are invariably guided simply by the impressions of
their senses, and who, accustomed to judge things only
by their outward appearance, have taken literally that
which was represented to them under symbols, and


182

have thus come to adore the actual image itself instead
of reality.

Abbe Dubois quoted in Swagato Ganguly, _Idolatry and the Colonial_
_Idea of India: Visions of Horror, Allegories of Enlightenment_ (New
York: Routledge, 2018), pp. 17–18. Equally, Hindus could
sometimes be surprised with Christian worship; in the late nineteenth
century, a young Brahmin girl, witnessing Christians kneel before
their chairs and pray, thought—in the absence of an image before
them—that they were ‘paying homage to the chairs’. See Meera
Kosambi, _Pandita Ramabai: Life and Landmark Writings_
(Abingdon: Routledge, 2016), p. 268.

This also meant that their earlier assumption that they alone had a
proper religion, while others had only superstition and forms of
witchcraft was now challenged; the Brahmins clearly presided over a
belief system that had its own internal meanings like Christianity.
Brahmins would also, for instance, deny that the lingam through
which Siva is worshipped is a phallic symbol. See Zupanov, ‘Lust,
Marriage and Free Will’, p. 205, even though iconographic evidence
clearly shows otherwise. For instance, the lingams at Vishnupad in
Gaya or at Devipuram and Gudimallam in Andhra Pradesh. This may
well have occurred as Brahmins, as shown in the Introduction,
accepted old forms but gave it new meanings that sat better with their
own theological positions.
Brahmins were already part of European imagination, despite no
actual interaction for about a millennium, thanks to ancient Greek
accounts. See Gelders, ‘Genealogy of Colonial Discourse’. Now with
actual interaction underway, they were understandably a reference
point for Europeans, just as the old romanticized Greek account of
Brahmins and their religion was replaced by present-day travel
reports.
In the 1560s, thus, Brahmins ‘not essential to the economic order’
were expelled, maintaining room for those on whom the government

depended, and who could not be replaced with Christians (yet). See
Xavier, _Religion and Empire_ , p. 91.

pressure. See Kurien, _Ethnic Church_ , pp. 43–44.

Christian beliefs. See Ferroli, _The Jesuits in Malabar_ , Vol. 1

During Akbar’s campaign in Afghanistan, the Jesuits passed Mathura,
believed to be the birthplace of Krishna, or ‘Crustnu’. They referred
to him as ‘a restless and unruly boy, a petty thief and liar. He lived
with a shepherd, and stole milk and cheese . . . and stole the clothes
of some girls who were bathing in a river. He broke the pots and
furniture of the neighbours . . . Beginning thus with childish mischief,
he went on to steal eight wives from their husbands by force, and
sixteen thousand by fraud and guile, as soon as he attained manhood’.
See _Father Monserrate_ , p. 92.
Even in the nineteenth century, tales around Krishna would be
weaponized by missionaries, and anxious Hindu respondents would

their status through the ceremony of the golden cow (p. 21), on the

“Kurava Vetham”, or the religion of the Kuravars’. See Dick

that high-caste Hindus sported. See also D. Dennis Hudson, ‘The Life

De Nobili, _Report_ , p. 60, p. 65, p. 67, pp. 69–70, p. 73. He supported
this argument by noting that priests could come, especially for
secondary deities, from other castes as well. See ibid., pp. 110–15.
Ibid., p. 121. See also p. 141 and pp. 153–55, where he notes how his
Brahmin converts had been attacked as apostates and for changing
their faith, but nobody complained about their wearing threads.
Interestingly, as early as the 1540s, when a Kerala prince converted
(‘the king of Tanor’), he insisted, successfully, on retaining his sacred
thread and other caste markers. See Xavier and Zupanov, _Catholic_
_Orientalism_ , p. 150.
Cronin, _A Pearl_ , p. 74.
Ibid., pp. 50–51.
Zupanov, _Disputed Mission_ , p. 65. This was, interestingly, not the
first time such debates arose. Among the Nasranis, there is an epic
that tells how in 293 CE , seventy-six families of persecuted Tamil
Christians fled to Kerala. Some were ‘led astray’ by a Saiva, and a
quarrel broke out after they began to venerate the products of the
cow, like Hindus, as well as to smear their bodies with holy ash. See
Frykenberg, ‘Christians in India’, pp. 35–36.
Quoted in Cronin, _A Pearl_ , p. 57.

As he wrote to Paul V in 1619, he had tried the conventional way ‘to
bring the heathens to Christ’ but this had not worked because ‘with a
sort of barbarous stolidity’, they refused the ‘customs of the
Portuguese’ and to ‘put aside the badges of their ancestral nobility’.

As he complained, even when he won in debates, they went away
‘more confused than converted.’ See Amaladass & Clooney,
_Preaching Wisdom_ , 46, and Mosse, _Banyan Tree_ , p. 8. This resilience
of the Brahmins, as Robert Cowan tells, was ‘in sharp contrast to the
learned Buddhists of Ming China and Japan, among whom the Jesuits
found not insubstantial numbers of converts’. See Cowan, _The Indo–_

willing to embrace Christian ideas but without simultaneously
embracing European culture, and practices such as eating beef. See,
for example, an 1817 episode from Delhi in Homi K. Bhabha, ‘Signs
Taken for Wonders: Questions of Ambivalence and Authority under a

by one of lower caste, or take a draught of the purest water from his
hand; and this solely in order to retain his caste position with the
heathen.’ See Samuel Mateer, _The Gospel in South India: Or the_

As an aside: it was possible to breach this clause of ‘the sun and

while retaining their old gods. See Nixey, _The Darkening Age_ , pp.

In this regard, recall again the idea of ancient Brahminism as a
missionary enterprise. See Arvind Sharma, ‘Ancient Hinduism as a
Missionary Religion’, in _Numen_ 39, 2 (1992): 175–92. In fact, just in
the century before de Nobili, in Bengal Brahmins were wooing the
Koch people by accepting their religious practices and deities, while
simultaneously recasting those deities as forms of Hindu gods. See
Eaton, _Bengal Frontier_ , pp. 187–88.
Claudius Buchanan, _Memoir of the Expediency of an Ecclesiastical_
_Establishment for British India_ (Cambridge: Society of Inquiry on the
Subject of Missions, 1811), p. 8.
Frykenberg, ‘Christians in India’, p. 41. Nasranis also appear to have
been reluctant to style Mary the ‘mother of god’, opening them to the
charge of being Nestorian heretics. See, for instance, van der Ploeg,
_The Christians of St Thomas_ , pp. 15–16.
Coleridge, _Life and Letters_ , p. 147.
Ibid., p. 174.
Lockman, _Travels of the Jesuits_ , p. xiv. As Rubiés notes, even Marco
Polo, we read in one manuscript, used to heal the sick back home
using soil he had brought back from Mylapore, from the supposed
tomb of St Thomas, and on having lost goods once to thieves, he
solicited the services of a Chinese idol for their restoration. See
Rubiés, _Travel and Ethnology_ , p. 65.
Protestants also saw the Nasranis as having been corrupted by the
Portuguese. That is, ‘while the Portuguese Roman Catholics had’
earlier ‘traced all the evils’ of the Nasranis to their ‘isolation from
Rome’, Protestants ‘considered that if only the Roman elements’
introduced by the Portuguese ‘could be eliminated’, the Nasranis
would be ‘a glorious exhibition of primitive purity’. See George
Milne, _The Syrian Church in India_ (London: William Blackwood &
Sons, 1892), p. 283.

Ibid., p. 89. It was later also claimed that Protestants ‘purchased’
converts. ‘In many of the small stations,’ we are told, ‘their efforts are
directed rather to make the Catholics become Protestants than to win
the heathens to Christianity.’ See William Strickland, _The Jesuit in_
_India: Addressed to All Who are Interested in the Foreign Missions_
(London: Burns & Lambert, 1852),
pp. 90–93. See also Gelders, ‘Genealogy of Colonial Discourse’, pp.
574–79
for how Protestants in Europe actively compared Catholic practices,
which they criticized, with so-called idolatrous Indian ones and with
Hindu reference points. So much so that one writer even described
‘Deumo’, the ‘devil’ worshipped in Calicut, as an agent of the Pope.
Besse, _Father Beschi_ , p. 89. This is not entirely surprising given how
even in Francis Xavier’s time a colleague complained how . . .

The people of this country who become Christians do
so purely from temporal advantage . . . Slaves . . . seek
baptism in order to secure their manumission . . . Others
do so to get protection from tyrants, or for the sake of a
turban, a shirt, or some other trifle they covet, or to
escape being hanged, or to be able to associate with
Christian women. The man who embraces the faith
from honest conviction is regarded as a fool.

See Niccolo Lancilotto quoted in Cronin, _A Pearl_ , p. 29.
Interestingly, Europeans were aware that Catholic–Protestant
sparring could affect their common interests in India. See Kruijtzer,
_Xenophobia_ , pp. 59–60, for example.

Promoting Christian Mission in India’, p. 32, in Richard Fox Young

dedicates much energy to fighting off Lutheran claims and justifying

the worship of saints and other Catholic practices.
From the late 1750s, the Jesuits of the Society of Jesus were also
expelled from various countries under European domination. This
was partly because governments in emerging nation states of Europe
began to view them as a rogue political network linked to the papal
state, till in 1773 the pope suppressed the society. It was reinstated in
1814 but did not regain its earlier influence. On Catholic grievances
in India in the nineteenth century, see Strickland, _The Jesuit in India_ .
Lord Macaulay quoted in George Otto Trevelyan, _The Life and_
_Letters of Lord Macaulay_ , Vol. 1 (London: Longmans, Green & Co.,

Jesuits in the world. See Francis X. Clooney, p. 80, in Bauman and

impact. Alessandro Valignano of the sixteenth century, for instance,
was tall enough to ‘turn heads in Europe and draw large crowds in
Japan’. See J.F. Moran, _The Japanese and the Jesuits: Alessandro_

also asked the captain to delay their exit.
There were, of course, Protestants who came before them, but
Ziegenbalg and Plütschau were the first _missionaries_ . The earlier
Protestant priests were chaplains and ministers for local Europeans.
Ziegenbalg and Plütschau were Pietists, whose movement was not

Of course, Jesuits in Goa also, in running establishments for orphans,
focused on providing a Christian education. In the south, as early as

school at Punnakayal.

Malabarian here does not refer to Malabar (Kerala) on the west coast,
but to Tamils on the east.
Ziegenbalg, _Thirty Four Conferences_ , p. ii.
Ibid., pp. 6–7.
A century before Ziegenbalg, a Jesuit had similarly lamented: ‘these
blacks are deeply attached to their diabolical foundation’ so that
‘whilst they recognise our religion as good, they say that theirs is
equally valid, that they can be saved with it, and thus with it they
want to live’. Quoted in Rubiés, _Travellers and Cosmographers_ , p.
218.
Ziegenbalg, _Thirty Four Conferences_ , p. 14. Ironically, in the
sixteenth century, a European, Guillaume Postel, also took much the
same line. See Raf Gelders and S.N. Balagangadhara, ‘Rethinking
Orientalism: Colonialism and the Study of Indian Traditions’, p. 114,
in _History of Religions_ 51, 2 (2011): 101–28. This Hindu conviction
in multiple paths would irritate Christians and be viewed as an
impediment to conversion even in the mid-nineteenth century. See
H.H. Wilson, _Essays and Lectures Chiefly on the Religion of the_
_Hindus_ , Vol. 2 (London: Trubner & Co., 1862), p. 82. It was also
noted by Islamic figures centuries before. See Alam, ‘Competition

Shahjahan accused ‘Franks’ of three sins: infidelity in religion; the

A Madurai Jesuit described the Bible printed by Ziegenbalg as ‘black

reading the first line alone caused ‘the reader’s eyes [to] burn’.

5. The process had in fact begun early. Writing in 1706, Ziegenbalg

described how his schoolmaster had ‘often put such Philosophical
Questions to me, as [they] really made me believe, that in searching
their Notions, one might discover things very fit to entertain the
Curiosity of many a learned Head in Europe’. See Ziegenbalg,
_Propagation of the Gospel_ , p. 30.
This collection was later published. See Sweetman and Ilakkuvan,
_Bibliotheca Malabarica_ for a full analysis.

missionary would suggest that while there was ‘much to admire’ in
Rama of the Ramayana—an incarnation of Vishnu—much of what
was ascribed to him was likely borrowed from Christianity. See

Indeed, within weeks of his arrival, he had stated in a preliminary
report that while Hindus had hundreds of deities, they did recognize a
single supreme god. See App, _The Birth of Orientalism_ , p. 44.

I use ‘monotheism’ for ease of communication. For why this might
not be the most precise term to depict Hindu beliefs, see Wendy
Doniger, _On Hinduism_ (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014),
pp. 10–20. So also, scholars such as Julius Lipner instead of
polytheism prefer ‘polymorphic monotheism’.

Similar tensions about the use of images existed in the Christian
world also. See, for example, Jas Elsner, ‘Iconoclasm as Discourse:
From Antiquity to Byzantium’, in _The Art Bulletin_ 94, 3 (2012): 368–
94, and Charles Barber, ‘From Image into Art: Art After Byzantine
Iconoclasm’, in _Gesta_ 34, 1 (1995): 5–10.
As did Buddhists: the emperor Ashoka also frowned on popular
religion. See Olivelle, _Ashoka_ , p. 214.
Quoted in Gandhi, _The Emperor Who Never Was_ , p. 168. See also
Eck, _Darsan_ , p. 45 where she quotes the _Jabala Upanishad_ , which
declares images as ‘meant for . . . the ignorant’.
I use the term ‘largely’ because Catholics, in Jacques Barzun’s words,
showed a ‘kind of polytheism’ in worshipping saints: travellers relied
on St Christopher, sailors on St Elmo and so on. See Barzun, _From_
_Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life: 1500 to the_
_Present_ (New York: HarperCollins, 2000), p. 22. It can also be argued
that in addition to god, Christianity also has semi-divine beings in
angels. See Michael Frede, ‘Monotheism and Pagan Philosophy in
Later Antiquity’, pp. 43–44, in Athanassiadi and Frede eds., _Pagan_
_Monotheism_ , pp. 41 _–_ 68.
The Brahmin Communist leader E.M.S. Namboodiripad would recall

gods and goddesses in our own Sanctum . . . and before the deities
housed in the various parts of the family house . . . [after which came

we should inadvertently skip any important god, a “compensatory
prostration” before all the gods together!’ See Namboodiripad (P.K.
Nair trans.), _How I Became a Communist_ (Trivandrum: Chinta
Publishers, 1976), pp. 4–5.
People could also ‘convert’ on this basis. Between the thirteenth and
fifteenth centuries, thus, sections of Gaud Saraswat Brahmins in Goa,
following the sage Madhvacharya, began to recognize Vishnu as the
supreme deity. See Frank F. Conlon, _A Caste in a Changing World:_
_The Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmans, 1700–1935_ (New Delhi:
Manohar, 2024 [1977]), p. 21.
Thirty-Eighth Letter in _Malabarian Correspondence_ , Part 2, pp. 202 _–_
04. Interestingly, in ancient Greece, too, the idea had emerged that
there was one god (singular) and that gods (plural) were subordinates
managing his dealings with mankind, just as an emperor had satraps
to manage his empire. See A.J. Droge _,_ ‘Self-definition vis-à-vis the
Graeco-Roman world’ _,_ p. 241 in Margaret M. Mitchell and Frances
M. Young eds., _The Cambridge History of Christianity: Origins to_
_Constantine_ (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp.
230 _–_ 44.
Eighth Letter in _Malabarian Correspondence_ , Part 2, pp. 136 _–_ 37.
This could vary, however. In the Deccan, the last (Brahmin) Peshwa
worshipped not just Siva and Vishnu on the occasion of the birth of a
son but also local gods such as Khandoba, Mhasoba, Vetala, Munjya,
Pir, etc. See Sudha V. Desai, _Social Life in Maharashtra under the_
_Peshwas_ (Bombay: Popular Prakashan, 1980), p. 103.
Twentieth Letter in _Malabarian Correspondence_ , Part 2, p. 171.
Twenty-Sixth Letter, _Malabarian Correspondence_ , Part 3, pp. 273–
74. Reference is to gods such as Mariyamman, Ankalamman,
Taruman, Perumal, Ellamman, Pitari, Viran, etc. The higher gods are
Vishnu, Siva, Subramania, Ganapati etc. We have, long after
Ziegenbalg also, Hindus stating this. In the early 1800s, for example,
one would assert how blood was spilled only for ‘infernal demon[s]’
by the ‘vulgar’ See Ragaviah, ‘Refutations’ op. cit. Buchanan, _Bihar_ ,


83

p. 361 also refers to ‘people of rank’ who ‘pretend to reject the
worship’ of the lower gods. For an example of how such attitudes
continue and inferior gods are dismissed by elite Hindus, see Fuller,
_Camphor Flame_ , pp. 97–98. All the same, scholars note that even the
‘lower’ gods and their rituals are joined in complex ways to the
‘higher’. See, for example, Madeleine Biardeau, ‘Brahmans and
Meat-Eating Gods’, in Alf Hiltebeitel ed., _Criminal Gods and Demon_
_Devotees: Essays on the Guardians of Popular Hinduism_ (Albany:
SUNY Press, 1989), pp. 19–34. Amusingly, later Brahmins, noting
blood sacrifices in the Old Testament, viewed the Christian god as
comparable to ‘one of the inferior Hindu deities’—this offered
another reason _not_ to convert. See Pennington, _Was Hinduism_
_Invented?_ , p. 71.
Richard H. Davis, ‘Images and Temples’, p. 349, in Olivelle and
Davis eds., _Hindu Law_ , pp. 347–70. However, this does not mean,
simplistically, that image-worship was a subaltern tradition
appropriated by elites. See Gilles Tarabout, ‘Theology as History:
Divine images, Imagination and Rituals in India’, in Phyllis Granoff

_reference to Vaisnavism: A Philosophical-Theological Inquiry_
(Abingdon: Routledge, 2017), p. 27, citing Yamnuacharya’s
_Agamapramanya_ .
Ibid., p. 43 citing the _Manusmriti_ . See also Davis, ‘Images and
Temples’, p. 351. In fact, within the Brahmin fold, vestiges held of
this conundrum: the higher classes of Namboodiri Brahmins in
Kerala even in the twentieth century were occupied with Vedic
studies and philosophy; priests were only a notch above _jatimatra_
(namesake) Brahmins. See V. Nagam Aiya, _Travancore State Manual_ ,
Vol. 2, pp. 249–50. See also David Smith, _The Dance of Siva:_
_Religion, Art, and Poetry in South India_ (Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 1996), p. 58. Interestingly, de Nobili also recorded
that among Brahmins the ‘truly authentic’ were those ‘whose constant
activity . . . consists in nothing else than in the teaching of the
sciences’. See de Nobili, _Report_ , 60, pp. 66–67.
See Lipner, _Hindu Images_ , pp. 25–33 for a detailed discussion. See
also Marko Geslani, ‘From yajna to puja’, pp. 104–05, in Knut A.
Jacobsen ed., _Routledge Handbook of South Asian Religions_
(Abingdon: Routledge, 2021), pp. 97–110. It is important to note that
this was again a two-way street and temple culture also drew from
Vedic ideas. Besides, as Diana Eck notes, even if Vedic poets did not
worship images, they ‘were image-makers in another sense; they
created vivid images of the gods in their poetry’. See Eck, _Darsan_ , p.
33. See also de Nobili, _Report_ , p. 78, where he notes that while the
Puranas were popular, many Brahmins and ‘idolaters’ themselves
frowned on them.

Service and Image Worship in Ancient India’, p. 132, in _Central_

also aggravated Vedic purists. See Knut A. Jacobsen, _Pilgrimage in_

For instance, in Vedic texts alone where there are references to the
consumption of meat, including beef, the same texts also elsewhere
prohibit it. See Edwin Bryant, ‘Strategies of Vedic Subversion: The
Emergence of Vegetarianism in Post-Vedic India’, pp. 195–96, in
Paul Waldau and Kimberly Patton eds., _A Communion of Subjects:_
_Animals in Religion, Science, and Ethics_ (New York: Columbia
University Press, 2006), pp. 194–203.
For example, Brahmins assisted the Mughal prince Dara Shukoh in
producing a Persian work celebrating the Hindu Upanishads as a
fount of monotheism. But those sections of the same sources that
risked compromising this goal were played down or phrased
innovatively to avoid weakening his argument. See Gandhi, _The_
_Emperor Who Never Was_ , pp. 209–10. See also Ernst, ‘Muslim
Studies’, pp. 183–87.
As early as the fourteenth century, a Muslim critic in calling on
Muslim kings to ‘overthrew infidelity’ in India urged them to
‘slaughter its leaders, who . . . are the Brahmans.’ Diya al-Din Barani
quoted in Friedmann, ‘Medieval Muslim Views’, p. 214. In the
eighteenth, a French father wrote, similarly: ‘Nothing is here more
contrary to (our Christian) religion than the caste of brahmins. It is
they who seduce India and make all these peoples hate the name of
Christian.’ Quoted in App, _Birth of Orientalism_ , p. 374.
First Letter in _Malabarian Correspondence_ , Part 2, p. 84. See also
ibid., p. 90.
Third Letter in ibid., p. 112. This is, of course, not to suggest that
Ziegenbalg only spoke to Brahmins; many of his correspondents were
non-Brahmin.
A. Leslie Willson, ‘Rogerius’ ‘Open Deure’: A Herder Source’, p. 17,
in _Monatshefte_ 48, 1 (1956): 17–24. Remember that though
Ziegenbalg wrote in the early eighteenth century, he was not
published for decades afterwards; hence Rogerius’s work remained a
key resource until the late eighteenth century.

Many of the father’s findings were anticipated by de Nobili. But the
Italian’s 1613 _Report_ was never published. On the _Open Door_ itself,
as Rubiés writes, it seemed not to throw open idolatry’s doors to
missionaries wielding the gospel but to unlock esoteric ideas behind
_image-worship_ to a European audience. See Rubiés, _Travel and_
_Ethnology,_ p. 309.
Rubiés, _Travel and Ethnology_ , p. 311.
Ibid., p. 325. As de Nobili wrote, it was unreasonable to suggest it
was ‘impossible for wise men among the non-Christians to produce
anything like a sound doctrine, such that even Christians could
benefit by it’. See de Nobili, _Report_ , p. 74, p. 101.
So much so that its less than broad-minded editor and French
translator were ‘somewhat mocking’ when they published it. See
Sanjay Subrahmanyam, ‘Monsieur Picart and the Gentiles of India’,
p. 201, in Lynn Hunt, Margaret Jacob and Wijnand Mijnhardt eds.,
_Bernard Picart and the First Global Vision of Religion_ (Los Angeles:
The Getty Research Institute, 2010), pp. 197–214. Or as Rubiés tells,
Rogerius provided for the first time ‘a full empirical narrative largely
free from any immediate polemical intent’. See Rubiés, _Travellers_
_and Cosmographers_ , p. 241. Indeed, it was so exhaustive, including
in deploying Indian words, that Sanjay Subrahmanyam believes _The_
_Open Door_ would have been practically ‘impenetrable’ to much of its
audience. See Subrahmanyam, _Europe’s India_ , p. 120.
Subrahmanyam however cautions against being too generous to
Rogerius; he is hardly ‘dispassionate or sympathetic’. See
Subrahmanyam, ‘Forcing the Doors of Heathendom: Ethnography,
Violence, and the Dutch East India Company’, p. 143, in Charles H.
Parker and Jerry H. Bentley eds., _Between the Middle Ages and_
_Modernity: Individual and Community in the Early Modern World_
(Plymouth: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2007), pp. 131–54.
Rogerius, _A Dissertation_ , p. 346. [See also William Caland ed.
_Abraham Rogerius, De Open-Deure tot het Verborgen Heydendom_ (‘s
Gravenhage: Martins Nijhoff, 1915), p. 118]. The father described the


-----

phallic lingam in some detail, causing anxiety to a translator who
refused to repeat its ‘immodest shape’. See ibid., p. 339. [Caland, p.
93].
Ibid., p. 333 [Caland, pp. 73–74]. This is not, of course, to say
women were not forced; only that ‘natives’ had a moral position on
forced sati. See Second Letter in _Malabarian Correspondence_ , Part 2,
pp. 108–09, where it is also acknowledged that sometimes, women
were indeed forced.
Ibid., p. 345 [Caland, pp. 113–14], ibid., p. 358 [Caland, pp. 151–53].
Holy days transcended provincial limits too: such as Sivaratri
(‘Tsevaeratre’), Shravana Pournima (‘Trasvanala Pondema’),
Mahanavami (‘Maherna Houmi’), etc. ibid., pp. 348–49 [Caland, pp.
129–30].
Ibid., p. 354 [Caland, pp. 144–45]. Again, we must remember that
this was all based on Padmanabha’s view; there were also Brahmins
who _participated_ , albeit not directly, in buffalo sacrifices. See for
example Biardeau, ‘Brahmans and Meat-Eating Gods’, p. 24.
Rogerius was conscious that what he was describing was specific to
Brahmins. See Will Sweetman, _Mapping Hinduism: ‘Hinduism’ and_
_the study of Indian religions, 1600–1776_ (Halle: Franckesche
Stiftungen zu Halle, 2003), p. 97. Rogerius _, Dissertation_ , p. 316

[Caland, pp. 13 _–_ 14]. So too, while he does not state it in so many
words, he noticed interesting subtleties in epic poetry. In describing
the Ramayana, for example, Rogerius observed how the villainous
Ravana’s power is enhanced with boons from Siva, while it is
Vishnu’s incarnation that defeats him. See Rogerius, _Dissertation_ , pp.
339 _–_ 40 [Caland, pp. 96 _–_ 99]. On the sects, de Nobili also makes
similar points. See de Nobili, _Report_ in Amaladass and Clooney, pp.
92 _–_ 93.
Or as he wrote, ‘The Bramins are very ingenious in heightening the
fame and reputation’ of their shrines using a ‘fruitful imagination’.
The idol of Vishnu at Srirangam, for example, belonged to Rama,
they said. After Ravana’s fall, Rama gave it for installation in Lanka.

The recipient was on the way, when suddenly he had to ‘make water’
in Srirangam. In the middle of a Vaishnava affair, Siva’s son now
appears and volunteers to hold the idol for thirty minutes. But, thanks
to divine machinations, the transporter takes hours to urinate, so
Siva’s son drops the idol, consecrating it at that spot. What Rogerius
records here is not just a local Purana but also an origin myth
reflecting rivalries between Saivas and Vaisnavas, whose gods
subverted each other’s designs. Ibid., p. 345 [Caland, p. 115]. Of
course, other versions of the story also exist, without Siva’s
intervention or the story of Ravana’s brother having a full bladder.
One states that the river goddess Kaveri was promised by Vishnu that
he would come to reside by her, which is why he was reconciled to
his image dropping in Srirangam. See also G.S. Ghurye, _Gods and_
_Men_ (Bombay: Popular Book Depot, 1962), pp. 110 _–_ 11. Either way,
this basic plot of one god’s doings necessitating another god’s actions
appears more generally also. In Kerala is worshipped
Vettakkorumakan, a son born to Siva and the goddess Parvati, when
they were living as hunters in the forest. He was originally a local
forest god, absorbed into the Puranic system, but what is interesting is
that his mythology talks of how this son of Siva grew into an unruly
young man, troubling Brahmins and sages during their sacrifices. It
took Vishnu to appear before him with a magnificent _churika_ (golden
short sword), which he offered the boy if he would promise never to
put it down. Vettakkorumakan then moved his bow and arrow to his
left hand (making it impossible to use it again) and took the churika
in the right hand. He was, in a way, disciplined, thus, and became
hereafter a protector of sacrifices.

on Sanjay Subrahmanyam’s ascription of the authorship of the text to
John de Britto in _Europe’s India_ , p. 126. What is interesting is that
where Ziegenbalg would get his information from Saivas, de Britto
obtained information from Saktas, crediting Parashakti, or the
goddess, as supreme.

While the term ‘Enlightenment’ is used here and ahead to convey a

Quoted in Gandhi, _The Emperor Who Never Was_ , p. 219.
Ibid., pp. 238–39.
The equation of Hindu sacred texts with the Western idea of scripture
is not unproblematic. See James Laine, ‘The Notion of “Scripture” in
Modern Indian Thought’, in _Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental_
_Research Institute_ 64, 1/4 (1983): 165–79. But I use the term in its
generic understanding as ‘sacred texts’ and for ease of narrative and
communication of the broader point.

Ibid., p. 207.
Before the Mughals, in the time of the Lodi sultans of Delhi, we read
of a Brahmin who was put to death for suggesting that Hindus and
Muslims worshipped the same god and both religions were ‘equally
good’. See Alexander Dow (trans.), _The History of Hindostan_ , Vol. 2
(London: A. Wilson, 1803 ed.), p. 153. With Dara, some even

Ibid., p. 330.
Except for the Atharva Veda, which de Nobili believed was lost.
See the section on the Vedas in de Nobili’s _Report_ , pp. 97–102. It is
possible that de Nobili read the _samhitas_ , or that part of the Vedas
with hymns to various deities, as opposed to the later Upanishads,
which deal with more metaphysical subjects.
Ibid., and Zupanov, _Disputed Mission_ , p. 116.
App, _Birth of Orientalism_ , p. 105.
Even de Azevedo who first reported on the Vedas, linked them to
_Tamil_ books. See Sweetman, ‘The Absent Vedas’, p. 786.
Ziegenbalg in 1706 also noted this difficulty. See Ziegenbalg,
_Propagation of the Gospel,_ p. 19.
App, _Birth of Orientalism_ , p. 375. Father Pons in Pondicherry was the
victim of this scam in 1726.
Bernier, _Travels in the Mogul Empire_ , p. 336. This reluctance
continued down into the late nineteenth century. Richard Garbe in the
1880s recorded that pandits in Benares were uncomfortable showing
Europeans their texts. See Kaushik Bagchi, ‘An Orientalist in the
Orient: Richard Garbe’s Indian Journey, 1885–1886’, p. 311, in
_Journal of World History_ 14, 3 (2003): 281–325.
See Sweetman, ‘Absent Vedas’. This is not surprising, especially
considering, as we saw in the Introduction, that many Brahmin
subcastes were actively denied access to the Vedas.
Ziegenbalg, _Thirty Four Conferences_ , pp. 138–39. Even de Nobili,
who did access these texts, was at first told that the fourth, the
Atharva Veda, was lost, prompting him to pass off Christian teachings
in its place. See Zupanov, _Disputed Mission_ , pp. 115–16.

Ziegenbalg was that Brahma—the lord of creation—had ‘ordered

responsibility. See Second Letter in _Malabarian Correspondence_ ,

See Francois-Marie Arouet, _Oeuvres Completes De Voltaire_ , Vol. 4

tells, Voltaire rejected Biblical authority, commandeering Eastern
histories.
Quoted in App, _Birth of Orientalism_ , p. 40. He was, that is, not
dispassionately studying India but making ‘use of India’. See D.S.
Hawley quoted in Halbfass, _India and Europe_ , p. 58.
Or to quote Wilhelm Halbfass, ‘In his polemics against Christianity, it
was vitally important for Voltaire to have chronological arguments’ to
bolster his position. See Halbfass, _India and Europe_ , p. 57.
Their creator, Brahma, was Abraham; his consort, goddess Sarasvati,
Sarah, for instance. ‘Vati’ being ‘madam’, apparently, making her

attempt to link Brahmins to the Abrahamic religions. See App, p. 30.

The French fathers had some experience in this direction: by the

showed the subtlety and sublime nature of Christianity—refuting and
criticising the grossness of heathendom.’

_and China; Performed by Order of Lewis XV, between the years 1774_
_and 1781_ , Vol. 1 (Calcutta: Stuart and Cooper, 1788), p. 104. While
this aborted infatuation, the text continued to circulate for decades,
until scholars agreed it was a product of deceit. Even the translator
was unknown: some thought it was Pierre Martin of Pondicherry, a
Jesuit who disguised himself as a Hindu to join a ‘Brahminical
University’ in 1699. See E.W. Grinfield, _The Jesuits: An Historical_
_Sketch_ (London: Seeleys, 1853), p. 200. Decades later, some laid the
_Ezourvedam_ at de Nobili’s grave, while others like the indologist
Max Müller, felt it was one of the latter’s Indian converts who wrote
it. One 1830s volume even announced, with breathtaking confidence,
that de Nobili (who died in 1656) personally sent the _Ezourvedam_ to
Voltaire (who was born in 1694). See Rocher, _Ezourvedam_ , pp. 34–
35.
Sweetman, ‘The Absent Vedas’, pp. 787–88 explains exactly how.
See also K. Meenakshi, ‘The Siddhas of Tamil Nadu: A Voice of
Dissent’, in R. Champakalakshmi and S. Gopal eds., _Tradition,_
_Dissent and Ideology: Essays in Honour of Romila Thapar_ (Delhi:
Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 111–34.
The ‘West’ in these contexts represents elite intellectuals rather than
society in toto, of course.
Sweetman, ‘The Absent Vedas’, p. 800. The story of the _Zend Avesta_
of the Zoroastrians is similar. Zoroaster was famous in Europe
through the writings of Pliny the Elder of the first century CE (besides
through speculation that he was Noah’s son Ham in the Hebrew
Bible). But even in the eighteenth century, his teachings were not
directly available. In 1754, Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron
learning Avestan, copied it from Parsis (Indian Zoroastrians of
Persian descent). After ten years of translation, in 1771, the _Zend_
_Avesta_ was published. It did not live up to Western expectations, and
Duperron was accused of not really knowing Avestan. Decades would
pass before he was vindicated, but the episode reflects how European


-----

intellectuals had preconceived notions to which they could stick
stubbornly.
See William Arthur, _A Mission to the Mysore: with Scenes and Facts_
_Illustrative of India, Its People, and its Religion_ (London: Partridge
& Oakey, 1847), p. 445. Max Muller, who translated the Rig Veda,
also stated in 1875 that it belonged to a ‘primitive and rude state of
society’. In his autobiography, he again noted how Europeans had
‘expected too much’ from the Vedas.
John Zephaniah Holwell, _Interesting Historical Events Relative to the_
_Provinces of Bengal, and the Empire of Indostan_ , Part 2 (London: T.
Becket & P.A. De Hondt, 1767), p. 28. As Holwell argued, there were
certain unrevealed, ‘primitive truths’ which ‘impressed the human
heart’ during creation. While later tainted, these included the notion
of a universal god; the immortality of the soul; and so on. See John
Zephaniah Holwell, _Interesting Historical Events Relative to the_
_Provinces of Bengal, and the Empire of Indostan_ , Part 3 (London: T.
Becket & P.A. De Hondt, 1771), pp. 4–5.
App, _Birth of Orientalism_ , pp. 297–323. Some scholars did believe
that he may have had a text, perhaps in Hindustani, not Sanskrit, on
which he based his _Chartah Bhade Sastah_ . However, Howell was
also notorious for writing the _A Genuine Narrative of the Deplorable_
_Deaths of the English Gentlemen, and Others, who were Suffocated in_
_the Black Hole in Fort-William, at Calcutta, in the Kingdom of_
_Bengal; in the Night succeeding the 20th Day of June, 1756_ (London:
A. Millar, 1758), a highly exaggerated account where he claimed that
of 146 English prisoners held by the Nawab of Bengal in a small
room after a military victory, 123 died of suffocation. Subsequent
research has shown that this was almost entirely invented by Holwell,
and that less than twenty died.
Dow, _The History of Hindostan_ , p. xxii. Unlike others who derived
knowledge from ‘the unlearned part of the Brahmins’, he argued, his
find was authentic (ibid., p. xxxvii).

Ibid., p. xlix. For a sustained study of Holwell and Dow, see Jessica
Patterson, _Religion, Enlightenment and Empire: British_
_Interpretations of Hinduism in the Eighteenth Century_ (Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 2022). Note also that Hindus have the
Vedanga, which refers to six disciplines, not to any one book.
See App, _Birth of Orientalism_ , p. 72, p. 74.
Sonnerat, _Voyage_ , p. iv and Stietencron, _Hindu Myth_ , p. 212.
Sonnerat, _Voyage_ , p. 1. For example, when Siva was revered in ‘the
instrument of re-production of the human species’, it was not an
obscenity as much as a symbol of the power of creation (ibid., p.
144). Sonnerat, like those before him, was influenced more by
Hinduism in south India than the north: for instance, he places
Ayodhya, home of Rama in the Ramayana, in Siam where flourished
the kingdom of Ayyuthaya. He even analysed the Puranas and the
chief gods of the Sanskrit pantheon to come up with his own theories:
Siva was the oldest, Vishnu emerging much later (ibid., p. 71).
Similarly, stories about incarnations and battles conveyed clashes
between sects (ibid., p. 79). The matter was never, Sonnerat laments,
settled, and sectarian feuds raged, till foreign armies penetrated the
land. This obliged Saivas and Vaisnavas to ‘suspend their religious
quarrels; but without reconciling them,’ which was why even in the
eighteenth century, each side treated the other with contempt. He had
clearly picked up these ideas from those he was speaking to and
seems to echo their views.

Ibid., p. 85.

Ibid. Or as Ziegenbalg had written, Hindus began well but ended up
‘deviating’; they did not worship Satan, but Satan ‘misled’ them. See
Ziegenbalg (Jeyaraj trans.), _Genealogy_ , p. 48.
Rudolph von Roth quoted in Hermann Tull, ‘F. Max Muller and A.B.
Keith’, p. 31. Haberman summarizes the general messaging as
follows: ‘You Hindus were once great . . . but that was past. You are

now corrupt, lost . . . We are here to help you . . . You are not capable
of representing yourself, for in your present state you are blind.’ See
David L. Haberman, ‘On Trial: The Love of the Sixteen Thousand
Gopees’, p. 55, in _History of Religions_ 33, 1 (1993): 44–70. That
Enlightenment minds had such confidence is not surprising. After all,
Montesquieu thought it perfectly reasonable to state that liberty ‘was
intended for the genius of European races, and slavery for that of the
Asiatics’. The latter were congenitally in need of outside assistance
and light.

_Recitation, and Ritual_ (Columbia: University of South Carolina
Press, 1994), p. 33.
Ibid., p. 27.
Quoted in ibid., p. 24. Emphasis added. See also ibid., p. 26.
As R.C. Dwivedi writes,

The mood of prayer in the mantras is hardly reflected in
the ritualistic explanations of the Brahmanas [another
section of the Vedas] or these in turn hardly form the
symbolism of the Aranyakas [yet another portion] or the
mysticism of the Upanisads. There is no real thematic
unity and continuity in the evolution of Vedic literature.

See R.C. Dwivedi, ‘Concept of the Sastra’, p. 44, in _Indologica_
_Taurinensia_ 13 (1985–86): 43–60.

Though formally there are exactly 108 Upanishads, in reality over
200 have been catalogued, some of these composed as late as
medieval times. See Thomas B. Coburn, ‘“Scripture” in India:
Towards a Typology of the Word in Hindu Life’, p. 445, in _Journal of_
_the American Academy of Religion_ 52, 3 (1984): 435–59.

Katha Upanishad translated in Swami Paramananda, _The_
_Upanishads: Translated and Commented_ , Vol. 1 (Boston: The

_Canon: Essays in Vedic Interpretation_ (Albany: State University of

This extends even to sectarian groups. As Fisher tells, Vaishnava and
Saiva ‘sectarianism, as it emerged in the late-medieval and early
modern period, was not a fragmentation of original unity but a
synthesis of originally discrete religions that gradually came to be
situated under the umbrella of a unified Hindu religion’. See Fisher,
_Hindu Pluralism,_ p. 31. See also Cherian, _Merchants of Virtue_ , pp.
19–20.
In this I follow Kaviraj’s analogy of Indian society as a big circle,
with many autonomous smaller circles within it. See Sudipta Kaviraj,
_The Imaginary Institution of India: Politics and Ideas_ (New York:
Columbia University Press, 2010), pp. 14–15.
On this, see again Debroy, _Shiva Purana_ , Vol. 1, p. xvi, where he
notes how ‘general understanding and practise of _dharma_ ’ by Hindus
‘is based much more on the Puranas than on the Vedas’. In politics
too, whether it was Gandhi or Hindu nationalist parties, a principal
point of reference is Rama of the Ramayana, rather than talk of the
Vedas or orthodox religious scripture.

As an example, the Dharmasastras base their prescriptions
theoretically on the Vedas, but with regard to practices that do not
appear in them, cite ‘Vedic texts that are now lost’. Reference to the
Vedas was often ‘a strategic exegetical device than a historical claim’.
See David Brick and Donald R. Davis, ‘Dharma in Classical
Hinduism’, pp. 76–77, in Jacobsen ed., _Routledge Handbook,_ pp. 72–
82. See also C. Sankararama Sastri, _Fictions in the Development of_
_the Hindu Law Texts_ (Adyar: Vasanta Press, 1926) and Fisher, _Hindu_
_Pluralism_ , Chapter 2 for the ‘vedicizing’ of traditions in specific
periods. For criticism of the ‘lost Vedas’ strategy by Hindu thinkers,
see Doniger, _On Hinduism_ , pp. 48–49.
See Fisher, ‘Remaking South Indian Saivism’, pp. 323–24. In the
seventeenth-century _Visvaguna Darsana_ by the Brahmin
Venkatadhvarin, one grievance against Virasaivas is also that they
‘reproach the Veda’. See Venkata Ramasswami, p. 52.
Fisher, _Hindu Pluralism_ , pp. 32–36. See also Sanderson, ‘The Saiva
Age’,
p. 289, where we read how early Saiva texts ‘boldly’ (even if mostly
theoretically) declared caste differentiation an unnatural ‘fabrication’.
See Richard H. Davis, _Ritual in an Oscillating Universe:_
_Worshipping Siva in Medieval India_ (Princeton: Princeton University
Press, 1991), pp. 29–30. See also Kamil V. Zvelebil, _The Poets of the_
_Powers: Magic, Freedom, and Renewal_ (California: Integral, 1993),
pp. 63–64, pp. 80–81, where we read of Sivavakkiyar who was not
above ‘repudiating the authority of the Vedas’. See p. 84 where we

find Sivavakkiyar saying: ‘In the Four Eternal Vedas/In the study and
reading of scripts/In sacred ashes and in Holy Writs/And muttering of
prayers/You will not find the Lord!’ On p. 101 we have Pattinattar
who too argues that god was ‘beyond the reach of the four Vedas’. In
a similar vein, some Saivas dismissed the Vedas as serving the
worldly; for the truly spiritual, only Saiva texts would do. See H.W.
Schomerus (Mary Law trans.), _Saiva Siddhanta: An Indian School of_
_Mystical Thought_ (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1979 ed. [1912]), pp.
18–19. See also ibid., pp. 6–7. See also Annette Wilke, ‘Negotiating

Doniger, _On Hinduism_ , p. 48. Emphasis added. There were also, of
course, texts in common to different sects. The Gita, certain
Upanishads, etc. were accepted by most. See Renou, _Religions of_
_Ancient India_ , p. 92.
See Embree, _Imagining India_ , p. 14. Temple ceremonies, for instance,
often saw a blend of Vedic rites with ceremonies of mixed origins. So
also, at great festivals it was customary for Sanskrit recitations to be
arranged—even if most Hindus did not know the sacred language, the
act of reciting and hearing was itself important. See Coburn,
‘“Scripture” in India’, p. 447,
p. 454.
Or as Arvind Sharma writes, Hinduism’s bond with the Vedas was
‘debatable’ and in ‘constant negotiation’. See Sharma, ‘The Hindus as
a Textual Community: The Role of the Vedas’, _India International_
_Centre, Occasional Publication 40_ , (2012): 18. Patrick Olivelle adds
how 95 per cent of Hindus had no access to the Vedas. See Olivelle,
‘Orality, Memory’,
p. 214. Aditya Malik also asks, ‘If folk religion is where most of the

practice occurs then isn’t it the ‘primary’ feature of Hinduism’ rather
than texts? See Malik, ‘Hinduism’, p. 18.
Rogerius, _A Dissertation_ , p. 321.
Quoted in Zupanov, _Disputed Mission_ , p. 131.
Dow, _The History of Hindostan_ , p. xxxvii. This was not exclusive to
India: as S.J. Barnett, _The Enlightenment and Religion: The Myths of_
_Modernity_ (Manchester: Manchester University Press), pp. 62–64
argues, in Europe also, the history of the Enlightenment has focused
excessively on the written, printed text of elite thinkers instead of
digging deeper, ignoring those ‘not represented in the historical
record’.
There are Hindus, in fact, who still believe that reciting the Vedas
from a book is improper. See Prasad, _Poetics of Conduct_ , p. 142.
Or as is noted in de Nobili’s case, pursuing Brahmin texts offered ‘a
reassuring sense of textual order that also claimed to represent reality.
If there was no perfect fit between the two’, they would ‘bridge the
gap between the real and the ideal.’ See Zupanov, _Disputed Mission_ ,
p. 25.
Ziegenbalg was told something similar. When debating idol-worship
with Brahmins, some of them said that whatever their flaws, idols
were worshipped for ‘Ten thousand Years’ by their ancestors and
gave the people contentment. Why meddle with a working system?
See Ziegenbalg, _Thirty Four Conferences_ , p. 181.
V. Nagam Aiya, _Report on the Census of Travancore 1891_ , Vol. 1
(Madras: Addison & Co., 1894), p. 327. In fact, as late as 1911, in
large swathes of upper India, census officials would find that ‘a
quarter of the persons classed as Hindus denied’ both ‘supremacy of
the brahmans and the authority of the Vedas’. See R.B. Bhagat,
‘Census and the Construction of Communalism in India’, p. 4354, in
_Economic and Political Weekly_ 36, 46–47 (2001): 4352–56.
Truschke, _Language of History_ , p. xxxiv. In the parallel sense of lived
reality, Leela Prasad’s research around Sringeri—seat of a major
Hindu _matha_ that authoritatively interprets tradition—showed that far

from this institution being ‘unquestionably central in the normative
worldview’ of locals, the latter had ‘plural sources . . . of the
normative’ that often deviated from the matha’s ideas. See Prasad,
_Poetics of Conduct_ , p. 12.
See for instance Parasher, ‘Mlecchas’, p. 22, p. 25 and Thapar, _Early_
_India_ , 260–61. See also Wendy Doniger and Brian K. Smith eds., _The_
_Laws of Manu_ (London: Penguin Books, 1991), where we read of
how the famous text, the _Manusmriti_ , emerged at a time when
Brahmin claims to social superiority needed a solid theoretical
framing, besides the resolving of contradictions.
Reference is to the famous Maharajas Libel Case of the 1860s. See
Judgement of Sir Matthew Sausse in Appendix, p. 82, in Karsondas
Mulji, _History of the Sect of Maharajas, or Vallabhacharyas, in_
_Western India_ (London: Trubner & Co., 1865). On the case itself, see

3 Of course, when they thought the balance of power was about to

switch, the priests sang a different tune. During an 1817 revolt
against the Company, the priests ‘openly proclaimed the fall of the
English rule’. See G. Toynbee, _A Sketch of the History of Orissa:_

5 On the Company and its slow integration in this period into Asian

political systems, see David Veevers, _The Origins of the British_
_Empire in Asia, 1600–1750_ (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
2020). This is not to say that the British did not get embroiled in
skirmishes. For instance, when some got embroiled in local politics,
the Company’s officials berated their own: ‘How you came in prison
you knowe well. ’Twas not for defending the Companies goods;
’twas for going . . . and tossing balls, with a flagg that was knowne to
bee the Englishes. It [the Indian ruler’s response] was but as any
other would doe . . . for marchants, while trading in a strainge country
. . . may live quietly . . .’ See William Foster, _The English Factories_

Much later in Bengal as well, we find this ambivalence. See
Pennington, _Was Hinduism Invented?_ , pp. 148–49.
The term comes from ‘du-bhashi’, speaker of two languages. In
Bengal, their counterparts were the ‘banians’. As Peter Marshall,
‘Masters and Banians in Eighteenth-Century Calcutta’, p. 193, in
Blair B. King and M.N. Pearson eds., _The Age of Partnership:_
_Europeans in Asia before Dominion_ (Honolulu: The University Press
of Hawaii, 1979), pp. 191–214 tells, service with an Englishman for
these Indian partners was lucrative, not from salaries but because of
‘a whole range of profits’—arrangements with contractors, gifts from
people seeking access and shares of their employers’ illicit trade. A
case in point is Krisna Kanta Nandy. See Somendra Chandra Nandy,
_Life and Times of Cantoo Baboo: The Banian of Warren Hastings_ ,
Vols 1 and 2 (Bombay: Allied Publishers, 1978, 1981). And dubashes
could be very influential. As one remarks in an Indian text, ‘Whatever
I say, [my boss] will accept.’ See Rao, Shulman and Subrahmanyam,
_Textures of Time_ , p. 27.

example in Hudson, ‘Life and Times of H.A. Krishna Pillai’, p. 192,
and K. Subba Rao, _Revived Memories_ (Madras: Ganesh & Co.,

festivities that served a similar purpose, with one 1819 journal
speaking of the ‘emulative rivalry’ between ‘wealthy Natives’.

1902), p. 163. See also Veevers, _Origins_ , pp. 254–55. So too in 1742,
the Travancore king Martanda Varma would tell the Dutch that as
traders, they had no business interfering in political affairs. See de
Lannoy, _The Kulasekhara Perumals of Travancore_ , p. 110. In the
early sixteenth century, the Zamorin of Calicut similarly warned the
Quilon rajah that the Portuguese were ‘a very bad race, and if he
admitted them into his land they would rise up against him’. See
Afonso de Albuquerque (Walter de Gray Birch ed.), _The_
_Commentaries of the Great Afonso Dalboquerque_ (London: Hakluyt
Society, 1875), p. 9. This was acknowledged in Britain also: a
character in Samuel Foote’s play _The Nabob_ remarks: ‘Why, here are
a body of merchants that beg to be admitted as friends, and take
possession of a small spot in a country’ only to ‘cunningly encroach,
and fortify by little by little, till at length, we growing too strong for
the natives, we turn them out of their lands, and take possession of
their money and jewels.’ Quoted in Nick Robins, _The Corporation_
_That Changed the World: How the East India Company Shaped the_
_Modern Multinational_ (London: Pluto Press, 2012), pp. 106–07. See
also Kruijtzer, _Xenophobia_ , p. 32 for a seventeenth-century European
urging the Dutch to keep Indian states ‘friendly through fear rather
than by begging’, and to prioritize military strength to cow down
local powers.

Thus, in the house of the nawab of Arcot, the regional Mughal
representative, one successor was backed by the British and the other
by the French.

This despite Clive’s promise that the Company ‘should not anyways
interfere in the affairs of the Government, but leave that wholly to the
Nawab . . . [and] return to Calcutta and attend solely to commerce,
which was our proper sphere.’ See Clive to the Calcutta Council, 30

In parallel, in India, it is assumed that all British were part of the

The expression was used by Denis Diderot, the French thinker.
As late as the second half of the nineteenth century, thus, Lord
Dalhousie would record the ‘perpetual disparagement of the power
that rules India’ by ‘mischievous’ minds in Britain, and the ‘perpetual
storm of attack, censure, contempt and calumny in the Parliament of
England, and from the Press’. See _Indian Constitutional Documents_ ,

See _Seir Mutaqherin_ , Vol. 3, p. 28. And when steps were taken to rein
in corruption, many officers disliked it. As a young Colin Mackenzie
wrote, the novel practice of sending out governors ‘only
distinguished for [their] uprightness’ prevented ‘our acquiring
money’; ‘the good old times when everything could be bought and
sold here are now no longer’. See Tobias Wolffhardt (Jane Rafferty

whom she was wed in six previous births. It is only due to sin on her
part that she was born in a Muslim family (suggesting inferiority).

Quoted in ibid., p. 27. See also pp. 188–89, where we read how
certain officers even took to wearing Indian clothes. This, however,
invited disapproval, for fear that it might diminish ‘British character’
and allow those officers ‘to do under its guise what they never would
have thought of doing in the costume of their country’. (Those who
did, such as William Fraser in Delhi, ‘go native’, evidently suffered in
their careers, showing that this anxiety was real.)

the Pundit Purdhan [sic, the other title of the Peshwa], would hold an
office, which, as in the case of that of the Dewanee in Bengal

[received from the Mughal emperor], would take from it none of its
sovereign powers; and its governing the country under this ancient
title, would, I believe, reconcile the Jageerdars [nobles] to the change
of masters, and to induce them to employ their troops willingly at the

for a dignified maintenance.

_Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Volume XIX: Satara_ (Bombay:
Government Central Press, 1885), pp. 310–11. The British belief was
that the rajah was in touch with Russia, though it turned out he had
contacted only the Portuguese in Goa. In any case, ‘Troops occupied
his palace . . . The Rajah was torn from his couch, placed in a litter,
carried for a distance of eight miles, and deposited in a cow-shed’,
after which he was removed to Benares. Meanwhile, over £300,000
in treasure was confiscated. See Anonymous, _Indian Annexations:_
_British Treatment of Native Princes_ (London: Trubner & Co., 1863),
p. 11.
Quoted in Ballhatchet, _Social Policy and Social Change_ , p. 83. As it
happened, in 1839, a rebellion was attempted in the ex-Peshwa’s
name, over two decades after his deposition. See S.P. Desai, ‘A Little
Known Rising Instigated by the Ex-Peshwa (1838–1839)’, in
_Proceedings of the Indian History Congress_ 32 (1970): 63–68.
Ballhatchet, _Social Policy and Social Change_ , pp. 85–86. Eight
thousand Brahmins benefitted from the Peshwa’s largesse. Many
followed the Peshwa in exile—in 1837 there were 8000 people in the
ex-Peshwa’s camp, and by 1847 the number crossed 15,000. See
Pratul C. Gupta, _The Last Peshwa and the English Commissioners:_
_1818_ – _1851_ (Calcutta: S.C. Sarkar & Sons, 1944), pp. 6–7. The
_dakshina_ given to Brahmins under the Peshwas were large: the Rs
16,354 in 1736 apparently went up to Rs 18,00,000 in 1758. In 1770,
nearly 40,000 Brahmins received dakshina from the Peshwa. Cited in

And Indians often responded. In 1809, Hindus in Benares in a dispute
with local Muslims called on the Company as ‘the distributor of
justice’ that was ‘acquainted with the Beyds (the Vedas), (the)
Poorauns (Puranas)’ and so on. See Copland et al., _History of State_

Quoted in Stein, _Thomas Munro_ , p. 238. See also Munro, ‘Southern
India’, pp. 233–34. All that was needed, he argued, was to
‘ameliorate’ what was well established. Quoted in Stein, _Thomas_
_Munro_ , p. 125. For his attack on the Bengal system, see ibid., p. 106.
Indeed, all three men in the new areas under their supervision resisted
reforms of the Bengal variety, preferring ‘native’ institutions or
methods that came closest. See ibid., pp. 182–83 for a note on
Munro’s struggles, for instance. He, in fact, lobbied the Board of
Control where there were sympathetic figures like James Cumming to
get them to thwart the Company officialdom. This sometimes
included exchanges on even wording. As Munro wrote once:

I think it necessary to caution you, that if it is expected
that instructions are to be obeyed, the strongest and
plainest of words must be used: for instance, the
expressions, ‘It is our wish’; ‘It is our intention’; ‘We
propose’; do not, it is maintained here, convey orders,
but merely recommendations. Unless the words ‘We
direct’, ‘We order’, are employed, the measures to
which they relate will be regarded as optional.

See ibid., p. 185. For Elphinstone’s criticism of the Bengal system,
see his _Report_ , pp. 55–56. See also ibid., p. 98 where he urges
removing abuses and ‘reviving’ the energy of native legal institutions
instead of imposing half-baked British ones. Elphinstone also wrote:

‘I am convinced the Maratha plan if cleaned of abuses & vigorously
acted on will do very well for the people & and I should dread to see
Judges’ of the Bengal type. Quoted in Ballhatchet, _Social Policy and_
_Social Change_ , p. 105. Recognizing the complexity of the country,
Munro also suggested that it was best to leave each province to ‘act
for itself’ in ways that fitted its context. Quoted in Stein, _Thomas_
_Munro_ , p. 280.

These men were also influenced by Romanticism in this period in
Europe. See Metcalf, _Ideologies_ , pp. 24–25. Munro also believed that
Indians should be appointed to the Company government’s higher
offices, deeming their exclusion unjust. See Munro’s Minute dated 31
December 1824 in _The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register_ , Vol. 3

Ballhatchet, _Social Policy and Social Change_ , p. 250. See also
Edward Colebrooke, _Memoir of the Honourable Mountstuart_
_Elphinstone_ (London: Parker, Son & Bourn, 1861), pp. 72–73 where
Elphinstone is described in a conversation as stating that to educate
natives was ‘our high road back to Europe’. When asked why he
insisted on it if that were the case, he replied that it was ‘our duty’.
Quoted in Ballhatchet, _Social Policy and Social Change_ , p. 43. See
also ibid., p. 45, where Elphinstone urges supporting the old charities
of the Peshwa, for otherwise the unhappiness would offer ‘fine
materials for an intriguing ex-Paishwah’.
Viswanathan, _Masks_ , p. 32. Remarkably, similar views were
expressed centuries before by some Portuguese minds in Goa as well.
Instead of the tough style in vogue, one man suggested ‘a light and
soft yoke’ and a ‘liberal’ administration. Even Christianity in Goa, he
advised, ‘amidst such diverse non-Christian sects’ must be ‘simple
and plain and tolerant, without rigour or excessively narrow views’.
See D’Costa, _The Christianisation of the Goa Islands_ , p. 68.

Mountstuart Elphinstone, _Report on the Territories Conquered from_
_the Paishwa_ (Calcutta: Government Gazette Press, 1821), p. 60.
Quoted in Bearce, _British Attitudes_ , p. 134. Long before, William
Bolts had also warned that ‘the most despicable reptiles will turn
when trod upon’. See Bolts, _Considerations_ , p. vii. Interestingly,
compared to Elphinstone, Munro and Malcolm were even more
openminded. For a declaration by Munro in favour of diversity, see
McLaren, ‘Writing and Making History’, p. 207. When once asked if
India would benefit from exposure to the West, he responded that if
‘Hindoos’ were backward in science and government, in other areas,
they were the superiors. Indeed, ‘if civilization is to become an article
of trade between the two countries, I am convinced,’ he finished, ‘that
this country [Britain] will gain by the import cargo.’ Quoted in Stein,
_Thomas Munro_ , p. 162. Munro also lamented what British dominance
would do to the Indian nation. Without leaders in positions of
authority, even if they benefited from the security and peace, they
would be ‘debased’ and lose ‘national character’ and self-respect. See
ibid., p. 224. Malcolm agreed: The Company’s role ought to be
limited to ‘useful public works’, ‘a moderate assessment of revenue’,
‘toleration’ of religious practices, and to govern India ‘with more
attention to . . . the character and condition of [its] inhabitants, than to
the wishes and prejudices of those of England’. For as a regime ‘of
strangers’, British power could not ‘endure but in the shape’
suggested above. See John Malcolm, _The Political History of India:_

The land revenue demand for Purnea district was raised by £260,000

Hastings’s government lost their licenses to those who could i.e.,
those willing to use force. See Amit Ray, _Representations of India,_

Hastings sought ‘a sense of harmony between India and Britain’,
having William Hodges do a series of paintings. See Ashok Malhotra,
_Making British Indian Fictions: 1772–1823_ (New York: Palgrave
Macmillan, 2012), p. 37. As late as 1812, Hastings would write that
Indians were not ‘sufficiently noticed’, that they deserved to be
‘participators in the same equal rights of society’ with white men. See

_1811–12_ (Patna: The Bihar and Orissa Research Society, 1939), p.
307. On p. 365, he also refers to a Muslim figure worshipped by
Hindus. Indeed, even in the 1880s, officials would see Hindus
worship a stone with an Arabic inscription. See A. Cunningham and
H.B.W. Garrick, _Report of Tours in North and South Bihar in 1880–_
_81_ (Calcutta: Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing,
1883), pp. 25 _–_ 26. This criticism appears among the more orthodox
elsewhere in India. On the Muslim side, Emperor Jahangir was upset
in the seventeenth century to see Muslims ‘traverse vast distances’ to
worship a Hindu goddess. See _Jahangirnama_ , p. 374. See also
Cherian, _Merchants of Virtue_ , p. 73. Among Hindus, the saint Ramdas
in Maharashtra, in the seventh _samas_ of the fourteenth _dashak_ of the
_Dasbodh_ , laments how Brahmins had forgotten their duties and were
following Muslim pirs. See _Shree-Samartha Ramdas-Swami-Virchit_

See Bhatavadekar, _Census of Baroda_ , p. 91.
Reference is to Bihar’s Bhumihars. See Buchanan, _Bihar_ , p. 325 and
pp. 357–58. See also pp. 322–24 for other Brahmin occupations. See
also Bayly, _Rulers, Townsmen, and Bazaars_ , p. 21. Interestingly, a
reference in the _Visvaguna Darsana_ to Brahmins in Kashi who
‘procure maintenance by arms and neglect the science’ may refer to
the same community. See Ramasswami, _Viswaguna Darsana_ , p. 30.
On actual military work by the Bhumihars, see Bayly, _Rulers,_
_Townsmen_ , p. 21. See also an overview of Brahmin professions in
pre-British Bengal in Kumkum Chatterjee, ‘Scribal Elites in Sultanate
and Mughal Bengal’, in _Indian Economic Social History Review_ 47, 4
(2010): 445–72. There were Brahmins among the Pindaris—dreaded
freelance horsemen—too. See Amar Farooqui, _Sindias and the Raj:_
_Princely Gwalior c. 1800_ – _1850_ (Delhi: Primus Books, 2011), p. 25.
In the south too, this trend appears: the sixteenth-century Brahmin
poet-saint Purandaradasa’s father was a merchant in Vijayanagara. In
Kerala, among the Namboodiri Brahmins also there were ‘Jatimatras’
(‘nominal Brahmins’) who could be physicians or warriors. See Aiya,
_Travancore State Manual_ , Vol. 2, pp. 250–51. V. Raghavan Nambyar,
‘Annals and Antiquities of Tiruvalla’, p. 76 tells of Tamil Brahmins
imported into Kerala specifically to serve as cloth merchants. In
Maharashtra, the saints Tukaram and Ramdas wrote of how Brahmins
would do any job if paid. See A.R. Kulkarni, ‘Social and Economic
Position of Brahmins in Maharashtra in the Age of Shivaji’, pp. 66–
67, in _Proceedings of the Indian History Congress_ 26, Part 2 (1964):
66–75. See also Marshall, _Bengal_ , p. 15. So also in Rajasthan and
Kathiawar, the Paliwal Brahmins were traders and bankers, as were
Nagar Brahmins in Gujarat. Sometimes Brahmins were punished for
giving up priestly vocations in favour of ‘more remunerative’ careers.
See, for example, Divya Cherian, ‘Ordering Subjects: Merchants, the
State, and Krishna Devotion in Eighteenth-Century Marwar’,
Unpublished PhD dissertation, Columbia University (2015), p. 92. In

late-medieval Andhra, there was already a bifurcation between
Brahmins who performed religious work and those who pursued
secular professions. See Talbot, _Precolonial India_ , p. 57. Nor was this
a new phenomenon: the Jataka Tales compiled 1500 years before
refer to Brahmin ‘caravan-guards, farmers, animal-herders, hawkers,
carpenters, snake charmers, carriage drivers, and wheelmakers’. See
Upinder Singh, _Ancient India: Culture of Contradictions_ (New Delhi:
Aleph Book Company, 2021), p. 14. A fourteenth-century Sanskrit
work, the _Parasaramadhava_ , also states that in the kali yuga,
‘Brahmins are entitled in particular to
practice agriculture’ and that ‘trades and crafts’ belonged to all castes:
formal concession, that is, for Brahmins taking up various vocations.
Quoted in Theodore Benke, ‘The Sudracarasiromani of Krsna Sesa: A
16th Century Manual of Dharma for Sudras’, Unpublished PhD
dissertation, University of Pennsylvania (2010), p. 273. In 1880s
Gujarat, it would be noted that of 300-odd professions, Brahmins
were active in ‘[n]o less than 115’. See Bhatavadekar, _Census of_
_Baroda_ , p. 148. In Maharashtra, we find Brahmins involved even in
the slave trade and making large profits. See Desai, _Social Life in_
_Maharashtra under the Peshwas_ , p. 56.
Buchanan, _Bihar_ , p. 353.
Reference is to the Pirali and Hussaini Brahmins. See Aparna
Bhattacharya, _Religious Movements of Bengal and their SocioEconomic Ideas (1800–1850)_ (Patna: Aparna Bhattacharya, 1981),
pp. 126 _–_ 27.
Buchanan, _Bihar_ , pp. 339 _–_ 40. In Kerala, a parallel exists in the
temple-drummer caste of Marars. In central Kerala, they are deemed
superior to Sudra castes such as the Nairs; in the southern Kerala, the
order is reversed. In Maharashtra, the Chandraseniya Kayastha
Prabhu’s caste went up and down at different times. See Deshpande,
‘Ksatriyas in the Kali Age?’ pp. 95–120. In Nepal, castes could be
raised from ‘impure’ to ‘clean’ status, similarly, by political leaders.

Buchanan, _Bihar_ , p. 310. Muslims in Bengal also participated in
goddess worship, often shared rites with Hindus, consulted Hindu
astrologers and visited temples. For an account of many such
overlaps, see Jafar Sharif (G.A. Herklots trans.), _Islam in India or the_
_Qanun-i-Islam_ (New Delhi: Oriental Books, 1972 ed.). See also
Swapna Liddle, _The Broken Script: Delhi Under the East India_
_Company and the Fall of the Mughal Dynasty, 1803–1857_ (New
Delhi: Speaking Tiger, 2022), p. 147 for the British trying to impose
the purdah on Mughal princesses in Delhi, based on their ‘imperfect
understanding’ of reality, when in fact ‘seclusion of women within
the royal family was not particularly strict’.
See Kapadia, _In Praise of Kings_ , p. 9.
_Seir Mutaqherin_ , Vol. 3, pp. 184–85.
Ibid., p. 198. Lord Bentinck, future governor general, would agree,
writing:

We do not, we cannot, associate with the natives. We
cannot see them in their houses and with their families.
We are necessarily very much confined to our houses by
the heat; all our wants and business which could create
a greater intercourse . . . is done for us, and we are in
fact strangers in the land.

Quoted in John Rosselli, _Lord William Bentinck: The Making of a_
_Liberal Imperialist_ (London: Sussex University Press & Chatto &
Windus, 1974), p. 146.

Colonial historians recognized this. As John Kaye wrote, in a country
with so many races, religions and differences, a ‘veil of ignorance
and obscurity’ separated ruler from the ruler. See Kaye, _A History of_
_the Sepoy War in India: 1857–58_ , Vol. 1 (London: W.H. Allen & Co.,
1880, 9th ed.), p. 510.

dated to the reign of Lord Cornwallis in the 1790s as governor
general though Ghulam Hussain sees it as beginning well before. See
also ibid., p. 159, p. 162.
Ibid., pp. 188 _–_ 89, p. 158. Ghulam Hussain also refers to Hindus and
Muslims as ‘brothers of one mother’. Hastings agreed in a sense that
the Mughals did not interfere much with their Hindu subjects. See

‘The power exercised by British rulers has none of that prejudice in
its favour which often supports hereditary monarchies and national
governments, even at a period of decline.’ Quoted in Harrington,
_John Malcolm_ , p. 153.
Indeed, Hastings himself would later speak with disapproval of some
of his successor’s innovations. See Ehrlich, ‘Straddling the Imperial
Meridian’.

Edmund Burke, agreed. Hindus, Burke believed, had ‘a law
accurately written’ and ‘great principles of jurisprudence’. See David
P. Fidler and Jennifer M. Walsh eds., _Empire and Community:_
_Edmund Burke’s Writings and Speeches on International Relations_

Lariviere, ‘Justices and Panditas: Some Ironies in Contemporary
Readings of the Hindu Legal Past’, p. 759, in _Journal of Asian_
_Studies_ 48, 4 (1989): 757–69, where we read how the texts were,
among a certain elite, ‘statements of theory’ if not ‘descriptions of
practice’. See also Lariviere, ‘Dharmasastra, ‘Real Law’ and
‘Apocryphal’ Smrtis’, pp. 621–22, in _Journal of Indian Philosophy_
32, 5–6 (2004): 611–27 for an example of how the texts themselves
emerged in response to specific issues. The _Devalasmriti_ , for
example, was composed after Islamic invasions into India, for
converts to regain Hindu status.
Which also comes across in how textual ideas, for example on widow
remarriage, might make later commentators uncomfortable, when
social attitudes towards women changed. The text would acquire new
readings. See Richard Lariviere, ‘Dharmasastra, ‘Real Law’ and
‘Apocryphal’ Smrtis’, p. 617.

Rocher, _Studies in Hindu Law_ , p. 56. They were a ‘scholarly and
scholastic tradition, not a practical legal’ one. Davis in ibid., pp. 18–
19. One is reminded here also of Singh’s observations on how in the
Mahabharata the official norm is ‘frequently ignored and
transgressed’. Indeed, in the _Arthasastra_ , she adds, while lip service
is paid to Brahminical ideas, in a clash with practicalities, it is the
practical that prevails. See Upinder Singh, _Political Violence in_
_Ancient India_ (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2017), pp. 66–

p. 122. Equally, we have a story, albeit unverified, from eighteenthcentury Maharashtra where a leading noble of the Peshwa’s court
found his daughter widowed while she was still a child. Permission
for remarriage—customarily disallowed among Brahmins—was
granted by leading legal scholars in Poona and Benares, but such
scholarly sanction did not ultimately prevail over local custom. See

Patrick Olivelle, ‘Social and Literary History of Dharmasastra’, pp.
18–19, in Olivelle and Donald R. Davis eds., _Hindu Law_ , pp. 15–29.
At moments, and in certain places, the texts may have had force, but
broadly they were, a second scholar notes, ‘legal fiction’, ‘divorced
from the practical administration of justice’. See Ludo Rocher quoted
in Donald R. Davis, ‘Introduction’, p. 4, in ibid., pp. 1–14. See also
Nandini Bhattacharyya Panda, _Appropriation and Invention of_
_Tradition: The East India Company and Hindu Law in Early Colonial_
_Bengal_ (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2008), chapter one.
Lariviere and Davis both argue that the _Dharmasastras_ were not
promulgated by ancient sages, as believed, but reflect records of
customs in different places, at different times, gathered into Sanskrit
texts. Davis notes for example that the _Sankarasmriti_ popular among
Brahmins in Kerala was composed in the fifteenth century, centuries
after its supposed author, Sankara, to give the text ‘an authority not
otherwise possible’.
Lariviere, ‘Justices and Panditas’, p. 762. Steele in 1827 also
observed how ‘different interpretations are given of original textbooks by different commentators’ and so different tenets were ‘held
as authorities in different provinces of India’. See Arthur Steele, _The_
_Law and Custom of Hindoo Castes within the Dekhun Provinces_
_Subject to the Presidency of Bombay_ (London: W.H. Allen & Co,
1868 ed.), pp. vii–viii.
In Bengal thus, ‘Most litigants appearing before British district courts
did not quote dharmasastra texts.’ See Wilson, _Domination_ , p. 84.
Ludo Rocher, ‘Father Bouchet’s Letter on the Administration of
Hindu Law’, pp. 18–20, in Richard W. Lariviere ed., _Studies in_
_Dharmasastra_ (Calcutta: Firma KLM Pvt. Ltd., 1984), pp. 15–48.
Moreover, even texts such as Gautama’s _Dharmasutra_ urge that the
‘laws of countries, castes, and families’, so long as they did not clash
with the orthodox position, have full authority. See Rocher, _Studies in_
_Hindu Law_ , p. 51. Of course, as Davis notes, while conformity with
Vedic ideas was ideal, it was ‘not necessarily a fact of history’,


-----

because ‘the standards of real people’ could supersede orthodox
norms. See Donald Richard Davis, ‘The Boundaries of Law:
Tradition, “Custom,” and Politics in Late Medieval Kerala’,
Unpublished PhD dissertation, University of Texas at Austin (2000),
p. 45. Greenwold in ‘Caste and Kingship’, pp. 55–56 also observes
how Jayasthiti Malla, a fourteenth-century king in Nepal, even when
he tried to introduce law based actively on Hindu normative texts,
made concessions to Buddhist influences and other local practices.
This inconsistency between the written record and practice appears in
economic matters also. Written sources prescribed that the king
collect one sixth of the peasant’s produce in tax. But in practice there
was variation. See T.V. Mahalingam, _South Indian Polity_ (Madras:
University of Madras, 1955), pp. 165–66, and Burton Stein, _Peasant_
_State and Society in Medieval South India_ (Delhi: Oxford University
Press, 1980), pp. 258–59.
See L.S. Vishwanath, ‘Efforts of Colonial State to Suppress Female
Infanticide: Use of Sacred Texts, Generation of Knowledge’, in
_Economic and Political Weekly_ 33, 19 (1998): 1104–12, and
Malavika Kasturi, ‘Taming the “Dangerous” Rajput: Family,
Marriage and Female Infanticide in Nineteenth-Century Colonial
North India’, in Harald Fischer-Tine and Michael Mann eds.,
_Colonialism as Civilizing Mission: Cultural Ideology in British India_
(London: Anthem Press, 2004), pp. 117–40. See also Cherian,
_Merchants of Virtue_ , p. 116, where we read how in Marwar in
Rajputana, while infanticide was outlawed, this was not stressed in
the same manner as other strictures. In fact, ‘saving animal lives was
a much higher priority than saving female infants’.
See Robert W. Stern, _The Cat and the Lion: Jaipur State in the British_
_Raj_ (Ahmedabad: Allied Publishers, 1988), pp. 102–05. This is, of
course, not to say that all custom, among all groups everywhere was
unwritten; custom could be written down just as it might exist in an
unwritten format.

Similar patterns existed among India’s Muslims also, so that as one
medieval writer put it, ‘what time has sanctioned, they never
relinquish’ even if outside of scriptural principles. The _Tarikh-i-Tahiri_
quoted in Gyanendra Pandey, _The Construction of Communalism in_
_Colonial North India_ (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1990), pp. 85–
86.
As a later writer would record, the attitude was: ‘We observe our own
rules. In a case where there is no rule we ask the pundits.’ See John
D. Mayne, _A Treatise on Hindu Law and Usage_ (Madras:
Higginbotham & Co., 1878),
p. 10.
Steele, _Law and Custom_ , pp. 122–23. Emphasis added. See also V.T.
Gune’s _The Judicial System of the Marathas_ (Poona: Deccan College
Post-Graduate & Research Institute, 1953) where too we read (for
instance p. 69) how, while Sanskrit lawbooks were referred to as
needed, ‘The mediaeval society gave more importance to tradition
and custom than to the written law’, and how ‘customs of the
different castes were scrupulously observed’ and that ‘the state was
not allowed to interfere’.

India: Classical Hindu Law in Practice in Late Medieval Kerala’, p.
162, in _Journal of Indian Philosophy_ 27, 3 (1999): 159–213. Davis
elsewhere also notes that because his study of Kerala depends on
written texts, ‘it seems inevitable’ that they may not represent all
people. See Davis, ‘The Boundaries of Law’, p. vi. He also agrees on
p. 116 that while in Kerala, with its strong Brahminism, the sastras
were ‘powerful’ their influence was not ‘total’. Or to quote
Nedumpally, ‘Brahminical domination acted as an _external_ force’
while ‘within the boundary [of] these [other] caste groups’, they had
their own rules. See Nedumpally, ‘Ways of Knowing: Asaris,
Nampoothiris and Colonialists in Twentieth Century Malabar, India’,
Unpublished PhD dissertation, Emory University (2012), p. 111.

Even in military matters, the British did tend to ‘transfer theories
from one micro-environment to the subcontinent as a whole’. See
Randolf G.S. Cooper, _The Anglo–Maratha Campaigns and the_
_Contest for India: The Struggle for Control of the South Asian_
_Military Economy_ (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003),
p. 137.
Steele, _Law and Custom_ , p. 126. Wagle, ‘Kotwal’s Papers’, and Anne
B. Waters in ‘Family Disputes, Family Violence: Reconstructing
Women’s Experience from Eighteenth-Century Historical Records’,
pp. 3–14, in Feldhaus, _Images_ , study the Kotwal records of the
Peshwas. These demonstrate that while the sastras recommended
ways of handling crimes, to quote Waters, there was ‘flexibility and
pragmatism’. See also Elphinstone, _Report_ , p. 53, where he notes that
‘the custom of the country’ dominated, and the Sastras were
‘sometimes consulted . . . in cases connected with Religion’. See also
ibid., p. 81 for another such remark.
Reference is to the case of Raghunathrao Peshwa, sentenced by
Ramshastri Prabhune. The Peshwa system expected conformity to
Sastric texts in Brahmins, but much depended on other factors,
including affluence. See also Balkrishna Govind Gokhale, _Poona in_
_the Eighteenth Century: An Urban History_ (Delhi: Oxford University
Press, 1988), pp. 167–69 on how sectarian, caste-related, sexual
crimes, and other issues were handled under the Peshwas. See also
Elphinstone, _Report_ , pp. 55–57, where he states that any notion of
Maharashtra as ‘a complete scene of anarchy and violence’ was
inaccurate.
See Wagle, ‘Kotwal’s Papers’, p. 30 for an example, and Surendra
Nath Sen, _Administrative System of the Marathas_ (Delhi: LG
Publishers, 2021 ed.),
p. 248 for another case of rape, where the Brahmin victim of a
Muslim rapist was re-inducted into her caste after certain rites. For
more on maintenance of law and order and police duties at village
level in the Peshwa’s country, see Elphinstone, _Report_ , pp. 47–50.

Elphinstone also wrote how ‘Hindu law’, which was ‘our own
introduction’ in Bengal generated ‘dread’. See Elphinstone, _Report_ , p.
56, p. 71, and also Ballhatchet, _Social Policy and Social Change_ , p.
31.
Rocher, ‘Bouchet’s Letter’, pp. 20–21. This also matches a report by
a British writer in Maharashtra. Observing local peasants, he wrote:

. . . they are fond of conversation, discuss the merits of
agriculture, the characters of their neighbours, and
everything that relates to the concerns of the
community, and many of them are not without a
tolerable knowledge of the leading events of the history
of their country. On the whole, they are better informed
than the lower classes of our own countrymen.

See Thomas Coats, ‘Account of the Present State of the Township of
Lony’, pp. 204–05, in _Transactions of the Literary Society of_
_Bombay_ , Vol. 3 (London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, Brown, &
John Murray, 1823), pp. 183–280.

This appears also in the context of British sponsorship of grammars
for Indian languages. When one colonial officer asked people in
Faizabad in north India if they had a Hindustani dictionary, they with
‘astonishment’ asked why ‘men had to consult vocabularies . . . for
their own vernacular speech.’ Quoted in David Lelyvelt, ‘The Fate of
Hindustani: Colonial Knowledge and the Project of a National
Language’, p. 195, in Breckenridge and van der Veers eds.,
_Orientalism and the Postcolonial Predicament_ , pp. 189–214.
This point was noted by the Company’s British critics also. See Bolts,
_Considerations_ , p. 20, for example. For Mughal practice in Gujarat
where too Hindus were left free to handle their civil matters, and even
minor criminal matters were settled locally without involvement of a
state-appointed Muslim qazi, see Pearson, _Merchants and Rulers_ , p.
152.
See Eaton, _Bengal Frontier_ , pp. 179–82.

This, of course, also stemmed from political considerations of
stability. As was recorded in Kerala in 1673 by a Dutch commander,
the people were ‘not bound to observe any orders, commands, or
whims and council decisions of the king which are not in conformity
with their [own] laws, welfare, or privileges, and have not been
approved in their own district and ratified at the meeting of their
district assemblies.’ Quoted in Manu S. Pillai, _The Ivory Throne:_

Publishers, 2015), p. 251.
Guha, ‘An Indian Penal Regime’, p. 110.
See also Elphinstone, _Report_ , p. 81 where he notes that panchayats
were ‘often conducted in the way of conversation, and nothing was
written but the decision, and sometimes not even that.’
See Cumming, ‘Internal Administration’. See also Rocher, ‘Bouchet’s
Letter’. Here (p. 31) we read the Jesuit’s record in the early
eighteenth century on how every village head is ‘the natural judge’
aided by ‘three or four of the most experienced villagers’.
Respondents could appeal to higher bodies. Caste matters were
decided by caste assemblies, and religious gurus settled sectarian
disputes. See also a case cited in Sumit Guha, _History & Collective_
_Memory in South Asia: 1200–2000_ (Ranikhet: Permanent Black and
Ashoka University, 2019), p. 85. Finally, in 1807, Thomas Munro
also advocated the use of panchayats because these were ‘as much the
common law of India . . . as that by jury in England. No native thinks
that justice is done where it is not adopted’. Quoted in McLaren,
‘Writing and Making History’,
pp. 278–79.
Dodson, _Orientalism, Empire and National Culture_ , p. 45. Hastings
evidently recognized this. See Gleig, _Memoirs_ , p. 402.

be crude: as late as 1853 in Kerala when a low-caste man stole and
slaughtered a cow, his punishment was to have quicklime rubbed into
his eyes, until his sight was destroyed, and to be left tied to a tree.
Not only his high-caste master, but fellow low-caste men joined in
inflicting this punishment. See Mohan, _Modernity of Slavery_ , p. 66.

the British allowed a ‘composite’ system, where caste leaders
consulted on cases specific to their castemen, instead of having
Sanskrit books imposed flatly. See Mukund, _The View from Below_ , p.
32. Madras, of course, had its own problems, however.
Or as Dodson put it, the British birthed ‘an oversimplification of a

Marshall, _Bengal_ , p. 25. In the context of Bastar, Nandini Sundar
writes how the local judicial system with its ‘limited court hours,

that the Peshwas’ subcaste, the Chitpavans, had only over the
previous decades come into prominence. Posing as staunch, orthodox
Brahmins would also have been essential to their self-construction
vis-à-vis rival subcastes that looked down on them. See also Kotani,
‘Ati Sudra Castes in the Medieval Deccan’, pp. 57–58 for an order
where the Peshwas remove lower-caste persons from a certain temple

however, that he and Hastings had tried, and failed, to persuade the
pandits to teach him Sanskrit (p. xxxvi). At this time, in fact, a lot of
European sponsors of translations worked through Persian. In 1784,
Hastings would commission a second Sanskrit work called the
_Puranartha Prakasa_ , which was translated into Persian two years
later, and _then_ into English by Halhed. Jonathan Duncan also
obtained access to Puranic texts via Persian. See Carl W. Ernst,

dynamism to rigid textualism.) As a judge in Bengal complained, in
its ‘pure and original state’, Hindu law appeared straightforward. But
the whole thing was so encumbered with commentaries and
conflicting interpretations, that, combined with the ‘venality’ of
pandits, it had become unsettled. Quoted in Lariviere, ‘Justices and
Panditas’, p. 762. Steele echoed his views, noting how court
Brahmins could be ‘biased by sinister influence’; there was no way a
white judge could decide how truthful they were being. Steele, _Law_
_and Custom_ , p. iii. In 1823, the governor of Bombay, for this very
reason, grumbled that honesty and learning among pandits was ‘not
now common’ and was becoming rarer still.
Rocher, ‘British Orientalism’, p. 238. See also Bayly, _Empire and_
_Information_ , pp. 6–7, where he speaks of the British fear of the ‘wiles
of the natives’, and how ‘colonial knowledge was derived . . . from
indigenous knowledge, albeit torn out of context and distorted by fear
and prejudice’.
See Mayne, _Treatise on Hindu Law_ , p. 36 and Umamaheshwari,
_Reading History with the Tamil Jainas_ , pp. 60–61.
The pattern continued in the Bombay Presidency: Steele in the 1820s
responded to official desire for ‘a book of information’ to serve as a
‘complete code of laws sanctioned by Government’. The intention
was to identify rules ‘binding on all Hindoos’ and to separate them
from those specific to castes or local in nature. See Steele, _Law and_
_Custom_ , p. xviii.
Letter dated 10 October 1811 from Col. John Munro to Chief Sec.,
Govt. of Madras, IOR/F/4/385/9798.
Such ‘chaos’ was visible with Muslims also. In the 1780s, in Benares
when the British consulted local authorities as to how the Mughals
punished forgery, they were told that it depended on the judge, the
criminal’s status and ‘whether it was a season of scarcity or plenty;
whether . . . forgeries were very prevalent’, or not, and so on. See

the panchayat as a ‘traditional’ institution went through its own
mutations. See James Jaffe, _Ironies of Colonial Governance: Law,_
_Custom and Justice in Colonial India_ (Cambridge: Cambridge

In this, his views matched Thomas Munro’s who wrote how the
British tried ‘to better the condition of the people, with hardly any
knowledge of the means by which it was to be accomplished’. See
Munro, ‘On the Condition of Southern India’, in _Asiatic Journal_ 3
(New Series) (London: Parbury, Allen & Co., 1830), p. 233.
James Cumming, ‘Internal Administration’. Malcolm shared similar
views. By ‘vexing and disturbing’ local systems, and ‘introducing
principles of rule foreign to all their usages’, the British risked
rousing the ‘restless and bold spirits of the country’. Quoted in
Harrington, _John Malcolm_ , p. 141.
Nelson, _A View of the Hindu Law_ , p. 2, p. 15. In fact, even when
customary law _was_ given recognition, British authorities textualized
it as against allowing fluidity. See, for instance, Bhattacharya,
‘Remaking Custom’. Lord Dalhousie condensed the principle at play
when he said: ‘It is possible . . . to domestic[ate] primitive law: you
can redeem it from barbarism without killing it down.’
See the judgment in _Kattama Nachiar vs. Dorasinga Tevar_ in P.O.
Sullivan and J.M.C. Mills ed., _Reports of Cases Decided in the High_
_Court of Madras in 1870 and 1871_ (Madras: Higginbotham & Co.,

‘Barristers’, pp. 33–34, quote Judge Julius Jolly: ‘It is quite true that
before the establishment of British rule in India, customary law used

to be given more weight in deciding law suits than . . . any other
digest. Most quarrels did not come within the cognizance of the
Courts at all, but were decided by private arbitration.’ Rachel
Sturman also points out how publication of Henry Maine’s _Ancient_
_Law_ (1861) was an important milestone in the recognition of custom,
as well as the 1868 _Collector of Madura vs. Mootoo Ramalinga_
_Sathupathy_ privy council ruling where it was held that ‘under the
Hindu system of law clear proof of usage will outweigh the written
text’. See Sturman, _The Government of Social Life in Colonial India:_
_Liberalism, Religious Law, and Women’s Rights_ (Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 152. The British judge J.H.
Nelson also posed the question:

Has such a thing as ‘Hindu Law’ at any time existed in
the world . . . For myself I have always been unable to
bring myself to believe that the innumerable nonMuhammadan tribes and castes of India have at any
time agreed to accept . . . an aggregate of positive laws.

See Nelson, _A View of the Hindu Law_ , p. 2. See also pp. 12–13,
where he notes the eclipsing of usage, and how white judges, basing
their knowledge on translations, were expected to work ‘Hindu law’.
For another note on practical constraints faced by British judges in
interpreting and applying Hindu law, see T. Goldstucker, _On the_
_Deficiencies in the Present Administration of Hindu Law_ (London:
Trubner & Co., 1871). For a ‘native’ critique of the British judicial
system in 1831, see Rammohun Roy, ‘Questions and Answers on the
Judicial System of India’ in Bruce Carlisle Robertson ed., _The_
_Essential Writings of Raja Rammohan Ray_ (Delhi: Oxford University
Press, 1999), pp. 197–225.

Some of this comes across in contemporary Indian writing. Soon after
Hastings claimed he was governing India according to its traditions,
Ghulam Hussain, the Mughal critic, wrote in 1786 that the British
were _importing_ customs from their country. See _Seir Mutaqherin_ ,
Vol. 3, p. 162. However, not all such efforts were ill-designed.

In 1815, Charles Metcalfe admitted as much when he that stated that
‘sufficient attention’ was not paid to ‘local usages’. Yes, a ‘simple[r]
and a more summary’ style was ‘better suited’ to the land. But by then
the system was too far gone and overthrowing it would be
inconvenient. Besides, Indians were also at fault, he added, by
‘labouring to deceive’ judges. See letter dated 12 December 1815
from Charles Metcalfe, Resident at Delhi, to C.M. Ricketts, Secretary
to the Governor General, pp. 36–37 in _Modification of the Judicial_
_System_ . A judge also advised that small cases be left to local officers
and Indian authorities by which ‘people would be driven to settle
their little disputes among themselves; and the mischiefs attending
the numerous petty Courts scattered over the country with their knots
of law intriguing retainers would be avoided.’ See James Stuart’s
Minute in ibid., p. 18. See also Nelson, _A View of the Hindu Law_ , p.
15 for later criticism of how ‘Hindu law’ was continued simply
because it was by then established.
Francis Workman Macnaghten, _Considerations on the Hindoo Law,_
_as it is Current in Bengal_ (Serampore: Baptist Mission Press, 1824),
p. vi. One is reminded here of a scholar’s remark that ‘Codification as
a process of rewriting tradition was carried through not by selfassured imperial minds confident of their strategies and goals, but by
minds troubled by self-doubt and anxieties’, not least of which was
the sense of impotence that dependence on native informants
generated. See Neeladri Bhattacharya, ‘Remaking Custom’, p. 49.

cornering financial support. See Cooper, _The Anglo–Maratha_

Singh, would give ‘preferment’ to Brahmins. See Susan Bayly, _Caste,_
_Society and Politics in India_ , p. 66. Then there were cases like that of
the Peshwas in Pune—themselves Chitpavan Brahmins from Konkan
—who having acquired power, cemented it by importing castemen
from their ancestral region to constitute a socio-political and
economic network. See Gokhale, _Poona_ , p. 6, pp. 109 _–_ 12.

Rao, Shulman and Subrahmanyam, ‘A New Imperial Idiom’, p. 83, p.
88. Additionally, bringing in a preferred sect through patronage, land
grants and by introducing them into major temples, the emperor
created a religious frame to back political goals. As Stoker observes,
these ‘institutions came to function as courtly outposts, rest stations,
and targeted locations for strategic development’, especially in
conquered areas. While the Brahmins, thus, obtained platforms to
propagate their beliefs, their monasteries served the imperial cause of
stability. See Valerie Stoker, _Polemics and Patronage in the City of_

pp. 8 _–_ 9. In eighteenth-century Marwar, however, instead of Brahmins
we find rulers making use of (also mobile) merchant castes to shore
up power against hereditary kinsmen and chiefs. See Cherian,
_Merchants of Virtue_ .
See Ramasswami, _Viswaguna Darsana_ , p. 49 for example. This was
not a new state of affairs. In the _Lingapurana_ also we read how in the
kali yuga, kings were mostly Sudras, Brahmins ‘behave like Sudras’,
Brahmins were dependent on Sudras, etc. The _Kurmapurana_
complains how the twice-born would stand like supplicants before
Sudras and wait on them. Quoted in Benke, ‘The Sudracarasiromani’,

so altered by the Maratha Brahmins, in fact, that state papers in
Pudukkottai too came to be kept in Marathi. In Mysore too Purniah
introduced so many friends and relatives, that they became a
powerful class, loyal only to themselves, triggering insurrection. See

An elite performs a highly useful function for a colonial
power. From its numbers are drawn bureaucrats to help
in the task of administration and to interpret colonial
rule to indigenous society, providing a model of the
type of behaviour which the rulers hope might be
emulated by other groups of the society. In return the
elite hopes that it may be recognized as the legitimate
spokesman of its society and may enjoy a continuing
flow of benefits from the colonial power.

_Partnership: Europeans in Asia before Dominion_ (Honolulu: The
University Press of Hawaii, 1979), pp. 215–36. Halhed’s
overwrought claims were divorced from the facts, of course, for from
Akbar’s day, the Mughals had been keen consumers of Sanskrit—it
was Dara Shukoh’s Persian translation that granted Europeans access
to the Upanishads for the first time, for example. See Truschke,
_Culture of Encounters_ , and Supriya Gandhi, _The Emperor Who_
_Never Was_ , for detailed discussions on patronage of Sanskrit at the
Mughal court. See also Stephen Cross, ‘Turning to the East: How the
Upanishads reached the West’, in _India International Centre_
_Quarterly_ , Vol. 25, Nos. 2–3 (1998): 123–29. Halhed, of course, in
the context of Brahmins picking up linguistic innovations of the
Mughals called them people ‘whose ambition’ had ‘overpowered
their principles’, giving us a hint of what he would have made of
more intellectual cooperation between the two. See his _Grammar_ , p.
xii.

Decades later, in 1825, another Brahmin with a history of Company
employment, proclaimed also how Hindus had the British to thank for
‘judiciously and unequivocally’ reconciling ‘conflicting

not made in all these ages. Ramasswami, _Viswaguna Darsana_ ,

at the start of a 1783 work on the Puranas sponsored by the governor
general praised Hastings as ‘king of kings’, representative of the
gods, and even interpreted his name as _Hestina_ , meaning ‘the man
who always clearly ( _ha_ ) fulfils the wishes ( _ista_ ) of all people.’ Rosane

many Indians who were recruited to participate in one way or another

of Pudukkottai were Kallars, or of ‘robber caste’; the Holkars,
Maratha rulers of Indore, were Dhangars, or shepherds; the Nayaka
kings of the post-Vijayanagara successor states were Sudras; and
even in states like Travancore, where the rajah claimed to be a
Kshatriya, this claim was dubious.

among Pahari Rajputs of the Himalayan foothills, while sati—widow
burning—was valourized, implementation was infrequent. But in the
nineteenth century, a rani would be barred from acting as regent
because a rival faction convinced the British she had lost status by
refusing to die with her husband in keeping with ‘tradition’! See Arik

Sultan’s wives expressed a desire to be buried at the same place as
their dead husband on the grounds of custom, the request was denied
because some imagined pristine version of ‘Muslim law’ did not
certify the practice. See Kate Brittlebank, _Tipu Sultan’s Search for_

Indeed, decades later, as Nairs in Kerala clamoured for ‘reform’ and
the end of the matrilineal system (seen, after Victorian influences, as
unnatural), some would pick up the sastras as a justification for
making such a radical shift in local culture, and to bring things in line

with pan-Indian—and more generically Hindu—patrilineal practices.
See K.R. Krishna Menon’s testimony in _Report of the Malabar_
_Marriage Commission_ (Madras: Lawrence Asylum Press, 1891), p.
46. See also p. 10 (where we read how matriliny had no ‘code’) and
how the committee studying the subject could with difficulty find
only one thirty-seven-year-old copy of a Sanskrit text—the
_Keralamahatmyam_ —which offered some textual certification for
local practices. In this time, Nair marriage itself would be questioned,
with some arguing that because it had no basis in the sastras, it was
not marriage at all. Efforts to invent a basis did not cease, however.
As was stated some years later, there were men taking ‘considerable
pains’ to ‘[dive] into Sastraic lore to find a Sastraic origin’ for
matriliny. It was akin to striving ‘to extract sunbeans out of [a]
cucumber’. See _Report of the Nair Regulation Committee of Cochin_
(Ernakulam: Cochin Government Press, 1920), p. cxv.
This, of course, is on the pan-Indian scale. In provinces such as
Bengal, the census threw up surprises when it revealed that Muslims
existed in far greater numbers than imagined. See Rafiuddin Ahmed,

The Tanjore rajahs were not, originally, favourable to missionaries, as
we know from Ziegenbalg’s foiled attempts to enter their territory.

Shahu I (r. 1684–1712) was called the ‘Nero of Tanjore’ and his
successor Serfoji I
(1712–28) too was hostile. However, Indian converts like
Rajanayakan, a military man of the Parayar caste, managed to serve
as proxies; by the end of the 1720s, there were 367 Protestants in the
vicinity of Tanjore fort, and in the 1740s, Rajanayakan opened a
school inside the city. See Hudson, _Protestant Origins_ , pp. 45–47. A
high-caste convert Aaron (Arumugham Pillai) became the first
Protestant pastor in India, also ordained by the Tranquebar
missionaries. He too enjoyed freedom of movement in Tanjore (ibid.,
pp. 30–31).
Pearson, _Memoirs_ , 263. Schwartz had a personal dislike of the rajah:
he had denied Schwartz’s request for a mission school in ‘a very
idolatrous place’, seeing the father ‘as an enemy’. Jesse Page,
_Schwartz of Tanjore_ (London: Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge, 1921), pp. 131–32, p. 134.
One charge against Ameer Sing, the sitting rajah, was that he was of
illegitimate birth. But earlier in the eighteenth century also, there had
been a rajah whose mother was a ‘sword wife’. The issue really was
the rajah’s hesitation in 1796 to transfer three districts to the
Company. British troops surrounded the palace to force his pen—it
was only because the Bengal authorities were embarrassed that status
quo was restored afterwards. Rajayyan, _Tanjore_ , pp. 101–03. See also
Governor General John Shore’s letter dated 5 July 1796 to Henry
Dundas in Holden Furber ed., _The Private Record of an Indian_

_Control, 1793-1798_ (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1933),
pp. 102–03.
This was how Serfoji recalled Schwartz to Bishop Heber. See J.W.B,
_Life and Writings_ , p. 304. On Schwartz’s death, Serfoji commissioned
a marble sculpture showing him at the missionary’s bedside in his
final moments.

early eighteenth century, for example, we read how despite personal

quoted not just the _Digest of Hindu Law_ published by H.T.

Hickey, _Tanjore Mahratta Principality_ , p. 156. Serfoji’s son’s widow,
the Rani Kamatchi Bai, took the Company to court successfully. The
British had lost no time in marching troops into the palace to seize
not just valuables but also ‘toys, squirts, pins and needles’. The
governor general in 1856 refused to recognize a daughter as heir not
least because ‘perpetuating a titular principality at a great cost to the
public revenue’ was not agreeable (that Tanjore had surrendered
territory in return for this pension was forgotten). See J.B. Norton,
_Case of the Ranee of Tanjore_ (London: Richardson & Co., 1861).

Or as one scholar puts in the context of Serfoji’s _Devendra_
_Kuravanji_ , he was able to find a way to ‘locating oneself in yet
another world, while still carrying the older world and its forms of
expression’. See Aprameya Manthena, ‘Significance of the Kuravanji:

scholars. H.H. Wilson would remark, for example: ‘You see, I am not
a scholar, I am a gentleman who likes Sanskrit, and that is all.’
This is not to say that none of them had Christian motives, as we will
see below.
See letter dated 4 October 1784 from Warren Hastings to Nathaniel
Smith in Charles Wilkins trans., _The Bhagvat-Geeta, or Dialogues of_
_Kreeshna and Arjoon_ _in Eighteen Lectures with Notes_ (London: C.
Nourse, 1785), pp. 5–13. A successor as governor general agreed:
translation projects and Sanskrit studies were part of efforts to
‘inspire confidence in minds where distrust was habitual’. See John
Shore (S.C. Wilks ed.), _Memoirs of the Life, Writings, and_
_Correspondence of Sir William Jones_ , Vol. 2 (London: John W.
Parker, 1835), p. 18. Not all were convinced, however. H.T.
Colebrooke, in the same period, noted that Indians would ‘remember

the yoke as the heaviest that ever conquerors put upon the necks of
conquered nations’. See Rocher and Rocher, _The Making of Western_
_Indology_ , p. 19.
Richard Drayton, ‘Knowledge and Empire’, p. 249, in P.J. Marshall
and Alaine Low eds., _The Eighteenth Century_ (Vol. 2 in _The Oxford_

among the most respected of the orientalists—was not immune. At
home, he had a reputation as a republican, but where India was
concerned, ‘I shall certainly not,’ he wrote, ‘preach democracy to the
Indians, who must and will be governed by absolute power.’ Quoted
in Michael J. Franklin, _Orientalist Jones: Sir William Jones, Poet,_
_Lawyer, And Linguist (_ New York: Oxford University Press, 2011), p.
4. Before him, Halhed also wrote that it was ‘Natives of Europe who
are to rule, and the Inhabitants of India who are to obey.’ See

(Madras: College of Fort St. George, 1820), pp. 1–31. In 1807,
another colleague had also begun to note a contrast between Sanskritcentered narratives constructed in Bengal and contrary evidence
visible in the peninsula. ‘It is certain,’ Colin Mackenzie wrote, ‘that
the Hindu languages of the south of India are not derived from the
Sanscrit’. Quoted in Rama Sundara Mantena, _The Origins of Modern_
_Historiography in India: Antiquarianism and Philology, 1780_ – _1880_
(New York: Palgrave Macmillan), p. 81. See also Trautmann,
_Languages and Nations_ , p. 177.
See Bhadriraju Krishnamurti, _The Dravidian Languages_ (Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 1–43. The term ‘Dravida’
was already used in the medieval period for the languages of Kerala
and southern Tamil in the _Lilatilakam_ . But Kannada and Telugu,
which are part of the family, were excluded. See David Shulman,
_Tamil: A Biography_ (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2016), p.
6. See also ibid., pp. 17–18 for Dravidian influences in Vedic texts.
Dravidian languages also, of course, borrowed from Sanskrit.
This is not surprising given how so many missionaries acquired their
ideas of Hinduism from Tamil sources.
For an argument against the notion that Indians had mythology but no
historical consciousness, see Rao, Shulman and Subrahmanyam,
_Textures of Time_ . See also ibid., p. 5 specifically where we read how
‘Each community writes history in the mode that is dominant in its
own literary practice. By the same token, newly ascendant or
powerful cultures may deny history to the communities they seek to
dominate, and historicity to their texts.’
According, that is, to _Western_ historiographical traditions that were
formalizing history as a genre and subject with a universalized
method and process.

Dugald Stewart would argue that Sanskrit was similar to Greek
because it was _indeed_ Greek that Brahmins overheard during
Alexander’s invasion, mixed thereafter with Indian words! See
Trautmann, _Aryans and British India_ , pp. 124–26.
Franklin, _Orientalist Jones_ , p. 37. See also Trautman, _Languages and_
_Nations,_ pp. 14–15. Indeed, Jones, though not first to propose it,
would refer to Sanskrit as a ‘sister’ of Latin and Greek. With
Kalidas’s _Abhijnanasakuntalam_ , he first translated the text into Latin
and _then_ into English. See William Jones trans., _Sacontala: Or the_
_Fatal Ring_ (Calcutta: Trubner & Co., 1875 ed.), p. ii. Before Jones, in
1768, a Jesuit called Gaston-Laurent Coeurdoux noted similarities
between Greek, Latin and Sanskrit, but his work was not published
till decades later; and Halhed also, in his Bengali grammar from
Hastings’s time, spoke of a link between Sanskrit and Greek. See
Trautman, _Languages and Nations_ , pp. 18–19. And before them all,
Sirajuddin Ali Khan Arzu wrote of the ‘concord’ that existed between
Persian and Sanskrit, wondering why nobody had made the
connection. See Abdul Azim, ‘Khan-i Arzu’s Observations on the

As one scholar wrote: ‘It is less important that Colebrooke made one
mistake than that he furnished so many data that were accurate.’ See
Daniel H.H. Ingalls, ‘On the Study of the Past’, p. 193, in _Journal of_
_the American Oriental Society_ 80, 3 (1960): 191–97. Jones too made
errors. In his time, he assumed the Brahmi script was Ethiopian, and
that Ashoka was a Saiva king. See Allen, _Ashoka_ , p. 41, p. 141.
Quoted in Rocher and Rocher, _The Making of Western Indology_ , p.
23.
Ibid., p. 45, pp. 174–75. Holwell earlier also ran into pointed hatred:
He had proposed that Hindus, far from being ‘a race of stupid and
gross Idolaters’ with ‘monstrous’ images, had a religion with ‘a most
sublime rational source and foundation’. John Zephaniah Holwell,
_Interesting Historical Events Relative to the Provinces of Bengal, and_
_the Empire of Indostan_ , Part 1 (London: T. Becket & P.A. De Hondt,
1767), p. 6, p. 10. This depiction of Hinduism was declared by a
publication ‘nonsense, rhapsody, and absurdity’, besides an insult to
intelligence; Hindu religion was at best a thin tissue of tolerable
philosophy, and ‘debased Christianity’. See P.J. Marshall,
‘Introduction’, pp. 38–39 _._
Early on Colebrooke noted that despite Sanskrit texts, caste was not
as rigid as it seemed; ‘almost every occupation, though regularly it be
the profession of a particular class, is open to most other tribes’.

42. See also ibid., p. 29.

Importantly, this view was encouraged by Brahmins. One official, for
instance, found his pandit sneer at his desire to study the Kannada
language; it was, the Brahmin said, ‘an indignity . . . to be asked to
speak’ the vernacular. On the suggestion of bringing in a Kannada
teacher, he ‘laughed heartily’ stating that ‘he always thought the

purpose of education was to gain polish not vulgarity’—the point
being that true knowledge existed only in Sanskrit. See Geoffrey A.
Oddie, _Imagined Hinduism: British Protestant Missionary_
_Constructions of Hinduism, 1793–1900_ (New Delhi: Sage, 2006), p.
131. That is, Orientalist prejudices often coincided with Brahminical
ones.
Halhed, _A Grammar of the Bengal Language_ , pp. xxi–xxii. See also
p. 178 for further criticism of Islamic influence, and p. xix, where
Halhed states that what makes his study distinct from earlier
European writings about Bengali was his tracing its links with
Sanskrit. For the implications of this attitude, see Henry Schwarz,
‘Laissez-Faire Linguistics: Grammar and the Codes of Empire’,
_Critical Inquiry_ 23, 3 (1997): 509–35. See also Rosane Rocher,
‘British Orientalism in the Eighteenth Century: The Dialectics of

this theme of rescuing in general.

This is not to say all white authorities behaved in the same way.
William Carey, the missionary, in _his_ Bengali grammar argued that
Persian and other loanwords had enriched, not corrupted Bengali. See
Carey _, A Grammar of the Bengalee Language_ (Serampore: Mission
Press, 1801), p. iii. Halhed may well have published his imperfect
Bengali grammar to construct a reputation and further his career
interests. See Qayyum, ‘A Critical Study’, pp. 151–55.
Franklin, _Orientalist Jones_ , p. 268. In fact, Jones was to take a purist
stand even on technicalities. In Bengal, Brahmins used the local
script for Sanskrit, rarely learning the Devanagari of upper India.

Instead of noting diversity and Sanskrit’s adaptability (southerners
preferring the Grantha script), Jones dismissed this as proof of
Brahmin ‘indolence’. Quoted in Rosane Rocher, ‘Weaving
Knowledge: Sir William Jones and Indian Pandits’, p. 59, in Garland
Cannon and Kevin R. Brine eds., _Objects of Enquiry: The Life,_
_Contributions, and Influences of Sir William Jones (1746_ – _1794)_
(New York & London: New York University Press, 1995), pp. 51–82.
See also the original in William Jones, ‘A Dissertation on the
Orthography of Asiatick Words in Roman Letters’, p. 8, in _Asiatic_

_Inquiring into the History and Antiquities, the Arts, Sciences, and_
_Literature of Asia_ , Vol 1. (London: J. Sewell, Vernor & Hood, J.
Cuthell, J. Walker, H. Lea, Lackington, Allen & Co, Otridge & Son,
R. Faulder, J Scatcheed, 1799), pp. 1–56. A British judge was
essentially dictating the ‘authentic’ way to write the Hindus’ sacred
language. This derived from his belief that ‘the languages of Indian
were originally written’ in Devanagari. See Jones, ‘Third Anniversary
Discourse’, p. 27.
Similarly, in his ‘Hymn to Durga,’ Jones ‘deliberately censors the
sexual coupling of Shiva and Parvati as it may offend European
sensibilities’. See Malhotra, _Making British Indian Fictions_ , p. 71.
Rocher and Rocher, _The Making of Western Indology_ , p. 106. See

Indeed, in the larger scheme of things, while the violent muscularity
of the Raj draws notice, such intellectual schemes were ‘as powerful’
as ‘military and economic imperialism.’ Nicholas Dirks in Cohn,
_Colonialism and its Forms_ , p. ix. Orientalists, for example, did not
hesitate to place Indian history within Christian frames of reference.
Halhed’s _Code_ , besides seeking to give Europeans an idea of ‘Hindu
law’, was also intended to demonstrate its ‘wonderful

Correspondence’ with the Institutes of Moses. See Halhed, _Code_ , p.
lx. Jones, deploying complex calculations, citing parleys with a
Brahmin, extracting lists from Sanskrit texts and connecting Puranic
figures to Biblical ones also dragged Hindu narratives into the
Christian scheme of things. See P.J. Marshall, ‘Introduction’, p. 36, in
P.J. Marshall ed., _The British Discovery of Hinduism in the_
_Eighteenth Century_ (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970),
pp. 1–44, and Jones, ‘The Third Anniversary Discourse’, p. 29. See
also Trautmann, _Languages and Nations_ , pp. 15–16, and Trautmann,
_Aryans and British India_ , p. 74 for Jones’s role in making the study of
Hinduism ‘safe’ for Protestant Christians.

See Preface in William Jones, _Sacontala,_ p. i. See also Rocher, ‘The
Career of Radhakanta Tarkavagisa’, p. 629, where we read how Jones
helped pay his debts, and the man stayed in Company employment.
Halhed’s highly Sanskritized, artificial Bengali grammar was,
similarly, influenced by an ‘intelligent’ Brahmin tutor, who seemingly
shared his passion for the ‘classical’. See Qayyum, pp. 77–90, pp.
136–39, p. 161, p. 177.
See Trautmann, _Aryans and British India_ , pp. 91–92. See also

information to orientalists could manipulate material. See Dirks,
_Castes of Mind_ , p. 103. Even one like Colebrooke, when writing on
Buddhism and Jainism, was dependent on (prejudiced) Brahmin
sources. See Rocher and Rocher, _The Making of Western Indology_ , p.
172.

As Mackenzie wrote, ‘My own want of knowledge of the languages,
has rather impeded my progress; but I have the advantage of able
native assistants.’ Quoted in Mantena, _The Origins of Modern_
_Historiography_ , p. 66. By the end of the first decade of the nineteenth
century, in fact, Mackenzie had eleven assistants, including the
Kavali brothers, a Jain, a Muslim, Christians and others. See
Wolffhardt, _Unearthing the Past to Forge the Future_ , p. 188.

‘The qualifications of Cavelly Venkata for such an office’ were not
appropriate, according to Prinsep. Indeed, no native could ever be
‘equal to such a task’. Indians may be useful ‘as auxiliaries’ in ‘a train
of research’ supervised by a white superior but any ‘outlay of public
money’ to a project solely under ‘native’ direction was preposterous.
See ‘Report of the Committee of Papers on Cavelly Venkata
Lachmia’s proposed renewal of Col. Mackenzie’s investigations’ in

5 (Calcutta: Baptist Mission Press, 1836), pp. 512–13.
Mantena, _The Origins of Modern Historiography_ , p. 82, pp. 106–07.
This also highlights another dynamic with Orientalism. In
discovering Ashoka’s inscriptions, Alexander Cunningham is a
prominent name. However, in the same period, an Indian called
Bhagwanlal Indraji was also cataloguing inscriptions. ‘His work is
much less recognized that Cunningham’s because the bulk of his
early writings was in Gujarati,’ not English. See Lahiri, _Ashoka in_
_Ancient India_ , p. 16.
See Ramasswami, _Viswaguna Darsana_ . In 1828, Ramasswami
published in English, the _Descriptive and Historical Sketches of_
_Cities and Places in the Dekkan_ , followed in the next year by
_Biographical Sketches of the Dekkan Poets_ . Both were intended for a
Western readership—where, for instance, supernatural elements
appear in his biographical snippets, he is apologetic about having to
include them. See Cavelly Venkata Ramaswamie, _Biographical_

more on other ‘pundit-publishers’, see Blackburn, _Print, Folklore,_

Mackenzie’s assistants, prepared for him an outline for a proposed
history of south India. As Mantena, writes, if Borayya (who died soon
after) had gone ahead, he would have produced a book at par with
histories authored by colonial authorities in the late eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries; a new, Western-style history, created,
however, by an Indian. See Mantena, _The Origins of Modern_

As scholars such as Richard H. Davis, Edwin F. Bryant and others
note, the _Bhagavata Purana_ offers a more emotional, humanized
form of the deity; where the former reveals Krishna as omnipotent
and supreme, the Puranic Krishna appears as a friend, child, lover,
prankster and more. Jones, incidentally, quite enjoyed this purana,
describing it as ‘by far the most entertaining book . . . that I have ever
read’ with great ‘novelty and wildness’. See footnote in Marshall, _The_
_British Discovery of Hinduism_ , p. 205.
Missionaries, in fact, tended to focus on _this_ Krishna to embarrass
their Hindu disputants. See Nagappa Gowda, _The Bhagavadgita in_
_the Nationalist Discourse_ (New Delhi: Oxford University Press,

Chandra Chattopadhyay attempted to construct a more serious
Krishna devoid of play and pleasure. See Anustup Basu, _Hindutva as_

it celebrates poets from other races,’ one says to the other. ‘However,
what is heartening is that the learned folk from other races have
realized our stature and give us proper respect . . . therefore, some of
the recent scholars from our part of the world have begun to show
some interest in our work.’ Quoted in Sumit Chakrabarti, _Local_
_Selfhood, Global Turns: Akshay Kumar Dutta and Bengali_

this day.
These last two paragraphs owe much to Bhagat-Kennedy’s
summarization of these dynamics in Bengal.

This view would be repeated by William Adams in his survey of
education in Bengal in the 1830s, when he wrote how Sanskrit
schools, though a ‘separate’ class of institutions from other village
schools, ‘represented the cultivated intellect of the Hindu people’,
receiving respect also because of the ‘hereditary sacredness’ of
Brahmins. See J. Long, _Adam’s Report on Vernacular Education in_
_Bengal and Behar: Submitted to Government in 1835, 1836, and_
_1838_ (Calcutta: Home Secretariat Press, 1868), pp. 196–97. Hereafter

Quoted in Narain, _Jonathan Duncan_ , p. 173. This was particularly
because their enemies, the Marathas, had great influence over
Benares, which, in its eighteenth-century shape, was largely Marathamade. And on the face of it, the investment paid: many princes—

Serfoji included—gave donations to the Benares college, though
there was suspicion that this was to please British officials, not a
sincere endorsement of their experiment. On Serfoji, see Nair, ‘The
Tanjore printing press’, pp. 513–14. On British suspicion of other
donors, see Dalmia, _Nationalization_ , p. 100.

support, madrasas and Arabic college were similarly established by
the Company. However, the Company did innovate in these Sanskrit
colleges, in that instead of the Vedas, the emphasis was on study of
sastras, which would be of use to British courts etc. See Kumar,
_Western India_ , p. 51.
One of the early instructors at the college, interestingly, was Pandit
Vidyananda, the same man who had supplied forged Puranic verses to
Francis Wilford.

that these ideas were widely known; only that some in India held
ideas and theories that aligned with Western scientific positions. Jai
Singh, the maharajah of Jaipur in the first half of the eighteenth
century, had also conducted his astronomical studies along the
Copernican model. See Kumar, _Science and the Raj_ , pp. 21–23. The
_Jyotisa Siddhantas_ ‘rejected Puranic cosmology’, so that some British
figures like Lancelot Wilkinson also presented Copernican models as
‘an extension of the astronomical Siddhantas’. See Christopher

tongues was tough: a Hindi edition of the principal’s _A Synopsis of_
_Science_ was ‘harsh and unidiomatic’. See Dodson, ‘Translating
Science’, p. 833. Finding vernaculars deficient in vocabulary,
translators then relapsed into Sanskrit to invent jargon, leaving
‘jejune’, ‘pedantic’ products, which few of its intended beneficiaries
could comprehend. See Hakim Ikhlef, ‘Constructive Orientalism:
Debates on Languages and Educational Policies in Colonial India,

Similarly, some years earlier, a Sanskrit translation was
commissioned of Robert Hooper’s _The Anatomist’s Vade-Mecum_ .
Many asked if it was worth it—given how a microscopic set of
Hindus alone was proficient with Sanskrit—to which the retort was
that this set was exactly the book’s expected audience. See ibid., pp.

And when a Pandit authored a work _Siddhantasiromaniprakasa_
(1836) in which he accepted Copernican ideas, he faced a backlash
from orthodox Brahmins, who published their own rejoinders
reinstating tradition over his modern proposition. See Young,

See Rao, _Beyond Macaulay_ , pp. 128–37. Convenience also played a
role here. The Company had been so busy, as stated in 1815,
‘repelling’ enemies and ‘securing . . . new possessions’, they had
‘little leisure’ to study the needs of the people ‘beneath our sway’ in
any serious manner. Lord Moira’s minute dated 2 October 1815 in
_Educational Records_ , p. 25. Or as a Bengali intellectual sighed,
‘coming from a distance of many thousand miles to govern a people
whose language, literature, manners, customs, and ideas are almost
entirely new and strange’, the British ‘cannot easily become so
intimately acquainted with [the people’s] real circumstances’. See
Letter dated 11 December 1823 from Ram Mohun Roy to Lord
Amherst in _The Great Indian Education Debate_ , p. 111. Setting up a
few ‘traditional’ colleges for Brahmins was just easier.
As happened between Mountstuart Elphinstone in Bombay and his
council-member Francis Warden. See also Zastoupil and Moir,
‘Introduction’, p. 46 for a similar split in London. This also meant,
however, that the colonial state showed a ‘calculated ambivalence

the local community, rather than some central bureaucratic order. On
how this changed after British intervention, turning the teacher into
something of an unhappy, underpaid bureaucrat, see Kumar, _Political_
_Agenda of Education_ , p. 50, pp. 75–85. The teachers were largely
remunerated in kind, with students giving grain, flour, vegetables
according to their means, and not with fixed salaries. See, for
example, Liddle, _The Broken Script_ , p. 199; Kumar, _Political Agenda_
_of Education_ , p. 78; and J.W. Massie, _Continental India: Travelling_

means a purely Indian phenomenon. In 1838, the Ottomon Sultan
Mahmud II remarked to medical students: ‘You will study scientific
medicine in French . . . my purpose in having you taught French is
not to educate you in the French language; it is to teach you scientific
medicine and little by little to take it into our language . . .; Quoted in

So far, however, as I have discovered, the Hindoos . . .
have evinced the strongest desire to attain, and a zeal in
the pursuit which indicated a deep sense of the value of
instruction. The educational philanthropist is not
required, even in rural districts, to use stimulants to
excite attention, or to beat up for scholars that his
school may be filled.

Laird, ‘The Contribution of Christian Missionaries’, pp. 151–52 also
notes ordinary villagers paying missionaries to establish schools. In
the 1840s, another civil servant reported a similar clamour in his
district. See Rao, _Beyond Macaulay_ , p. 185.

Hindu society that feared its advent. See Kumar, _Political Agenda of_
_Education_ , p. 63. Others were willing to accept English but
moderated by a regard for one’s own traditions and identity. As an
1852 Marathi article suggested, ‘Students who learnt only English
were likely to become shallow braggarts.’ English _and_ rootedness in
one’s own language were both essential like ‘brick and mortar’ in the

cases where students _gave up_ English for Persian, seeing greater
opportunity with the latter. See Laird, ‘The Contribution of Christian
Missionaries’, p. 322. An 1830s petition from Hindus even argued
that since the ‘higher posts are given to the Europeans, the lower
offices alone fall to the lot of the Bengallees’, it was pointless to
promote English. See Petition (1837–1838) from the Hindus of
Bengal in _The Great Indian Education Debate_ , p. 277.
Kumar, _Political Agenda of Education_ , p. 25. B.G. Tilak, for
example, a staunch nationalist who appears later in the century, saw
no irony in setting up a school called the New English School in
Pune. However, the cliché that colonial education churned out only
clerks was embraced by some Indians also. See Sen, _Iswar Chandra_
_Vidyasagar_ , p. 48, for a late-nineteenth century writing in which the
gods visiting Calcutta, find there only clerks.
On Indians being smatterers of English, Thomas Macaulay would
counter that there were ‘natives who are quite competent to discuss
political or scientific questions with fluency and precision in the
English language’. Some, indeed, even exceeded the English in
‘facility and correctness’. See Rao, _Beyond Macaulay_ , p. 162.

College remained the greatest achievement in the domain of purely
English education’. See McCully, _English Education_ , p. 25.

Lord Macaulay quoted in Michael John Whitfield, ‘Dr John Tytler
(1787–1837), Superintendent of the Native Medical Institution,
Calcutta’, p. 5, in _Journal of Medical Biography_ (2019), pp. 1–6. See
also Macaulay’s Minute dated 2 February 1835 in _The Great Indian_

Missionaries also often found themselves explaining to Indians that
they lacked funds and could not cater to all the demand to open new
schools. See Laird, ‘The Contribution of Christian Missionaries’, p.
151.
The governor general’s resolution dated 7 March 1835 in _The Great_
_Indian Education Debate_ , pp. 194–96.
The Renaissance in Europe was catalysed by a renewed interest in
ancient Latin and Greek works, not only of a philosophical nature—
which generated fresh ways of thinking—but also pertaining to
mathematics and science. As Macaulay wrote in his minute, if the
British in this time had remained wedded to their Anglo–Saxon
literature alone, ignoring a superior store of knowledge that came
from these foreign high languages, they could not have progressed.
India now, with English, was in the same position.
Macaulay’s Minute dated 2 February 1835 in _The Great Indian_
_Education Debate_ , p. 171.
Quoted in John Clive, _Thomas Babington Macaulay: The Shaping of_
_the Historian_ (London: Secker & Walburg, 1973), p. 368. In 1833, in
Parliament in London, Macaulay had also asked: ‘Are we to keep the
people of India in ignorance in order that we may keep them
submissive?’ See McCully, _English Education_ , p. 64.
Macaulay’s Minute dated 2 February 1835 in _The Great Indian_
_Education Debate_ , p. 170.
Indeed, when Macaulay pressed English, he also saw it as vernacular
training, in that the meaning of English terms would have to be
explained in local languages. See Rao, _Beyond Macaulay_ , p. 169

cause ‘caste, infant marriages, polygamy’ etc. to ‘melt away, like
snow before fire’. See Rao, _Beyond Macaulay_ , p. 203. In reality,
however, educated ‘natives’ would find ways to hold on to many of
these ideas, defending them in English. Or as Kumar notes in

deployed for ‘the reconstruction of a traditional India’.

Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar quoted in Sen, _Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar_ ,
p. 25. It was not easy: in Bombay, Jambhekar noted how in each
class, English passages had to be explained to students in both
Marathi and Gujarati (these being the chief language groups in the
city). The reward lay in the students’ keenness. See Rao, _Beyond_
_Macaulay_ , p. 111 and Naregal, _Language Politics_ , p. 109. Translation
of books was also not performed in a mechanical manner; elements
that would ‘apply only to Europe’ and would be incomprehensible to
Indian students were left out; instead, examples that would be more
‘easily accessible’ to the latter were used. See Naregal, _Language_
_Politics_ , pp. 120–21.
John Anderson quoted in Chakrabarti, _Local Selfhood_ , p. 65.
Chakrabarti, _Local Selfhood_ , p. 66. Naregal in _Language Politics_ , pp.
134–35 also notes the Marathi paper _Dnyanaprasarak_ , which in 1852
commended the British for ‘replacing a taste for ancient tales from
the puranas’ with ‘knowledge about the efforts to men’ who worked
to improve society.
Chakrabarti, _Local Selfhood_ , p. 194.
Ibid., p. 106. Indeed, Datta added that they anticipated key scientific
principles: To give an example, Kanada, in the early centuries bce,
had ‘propounded a theory of atoms’. The tragedy was that such
innovations were not developed further. See Tapan Raychaudhuri,
‘Europe in India’s Xenology: The Nineteenth-Century Record’, p.
164, in _Past & Present_ , 137 (1992): 156–82. Datta’s approach,
understandably, upset missionaries who accused him of ‘filching’
from the West what he could not find at home. See Brian H. Hatcher,
_Eclecticism and Modern Hindu Discourse_ (New York: Oxford
University Press, 1999), p. 114.
Chakrabarti, _Local Selfhood_ , pp. 144–45. See also ibid., p. 199.
Indians who went abroad also showed this kind of selective
admiration, on the one hand praising British liberty but not
pretensions to racial superiority; technology but not parliamentary
corruption, and so on. See, for instance, Charles Stewart (trans.),

_Residence of Two Years and a Half in Great Britain_ (London: W.H.
Allen & Co., 1841).
In fact, Lord Bentinck, the governor general who in 1835 sided with
English education stated his ‘entire dissent’ from keeping Indians ‘in
ignorance. I cannot recognize the advantage of ignorance to the
governors or the governed. If our rule is bad, as I believe it to be, let
the natives have the means, through knowledge, to represent their
grievances and to obtain redress.’ See Letter 730 in C.H. Philips ed.,
_The Correspondence of Lord William Cavendish Bentinck: GovernorGeneral of India, 1828_ – _1835_ , Vol. 2 (Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 1977), p. 1286. See also Raychaudhuri, ‘Europe in India’s
Xenology’, p. 162. It is also not surprising that these Indian teachers
fathered, quite literally, future nationalists. Gangadhar Tilak, who
taught mathematics and in 1854 published an award-winning text on
trigonometry, was the father of B.G. Tilak, a nationalist we will meet
in the last chapter. See Vaibhav Purandare, _Tilak: The Empire’s_
_Biggest Enemy_ (Gurugram: Vintage, 2024), pp. 3–4.
Frykenberg, ‘Modern Education’, p. 43.
Ibid.
Rao, _Beyond Macaulay_ , p. 60. Importantly where the British hesitated
to support the education of ‘untouchables’, missionaries refused to
recognize caste divisions, opening their doors to all equally. In the
mid-1850s, for example, in Maharashtra a Mahar boy was denied
admission into a government school. In 1833, in Madras, a Parayar
boy was similarly denied entry. See Eleanor Mae Zelliot, ‘Dr
Ambedkar and the Mahar Movement’, Unpublished PhD dissertation.

missionaries gained acceptability. Or as Strickland writes in _The_
_Jesuit in India_ , p. 127, it was as ‘a physician of the body’ that the
missionary ‘often first gains access to a Pagan house or village,
where, as a Christian preacher, he would have had no hearers’.

who wrote: ‘Did education have nothing other than intellectual
exertion and advancement of knowledge as its content? . . . Although
colonialism and the many-sided thrust of liberal politics made it out
to be so, there was more to education than was thus conceived. _It_
_stood not only for enlightenment but also authority_ ’. Emphasis added.

while some thought education would bring Hindus to Christianity,
‘We believe that they are being prepared for occupying a position
extremely antagonistic to it.’ This is not to say there were no
exceptions. A student of Hindu College once ate beef and threw the
bones into a Brahmin’s yard. See Laird, ‘The Contribution of

wrote in fact of maybe going to India someday and to ‘take part in a
work, by means of which the old mischief of Indian priestcraft could
be overthrown and the way opened for the entrance of simple
Christian teaching.’ Quoted in Chaudhuri, _Scholar Extraordinary_ , p.
325. In later life, of course, Muller would be accused of being _anti_
Christian.

January 1851 shows that Duleep Singh first learnt of Christianity
through a textbook called the _English Instructor_ and began asking
questions about Hindu customs, such as the benefits of bathing in the
Ganga. It was thereafter—by which time the maharajah had started

identifying ‘nonsense’ in his own culture—that he saw Bhajan Lal’s
Bible. In December 1850, he formally expressed a desire to ‘embrace
the Christian religion’ because ‘I have long doubted the truth of the
one I was brought up in’. See Login, _John Login_ , pp. 245–48 and p.
250.

later affirmed, ‘the choice was his own’, after he grew ‘much
impressed’ with precepts of the Gospel. See _The Maharajah Duleep_
_Singh_ , p. 82.
It was in 1851 that Duleep Singh’s desire was communicated to Lord
Dalhousie, who recorded in March 1853 that his ‘probation’ had
ended. See J.G.A. Baird ed., _Private Letters of the Marquess of_
_Dalhousie_ (Edinburgh & London: William Blackwood & Sons,
1910), p. 156, p. 248. Login, of course, knew as early as December
1850.
There was even briefly a plan to have this princess marry Duleep
Singh.
Veer Rajinder Wuddair’s letter dated 3 July 1856 in _Morning Post_ , 4
July 1856.
_Gloucester Journal_ , 13 February 1864. The British fear of Duleep
Singh’s mother was real. When someone spoke to Dalhousie about
the maharajah’s beautiful eyes, he wrote: ‘Those “beautiful eyes”,
with which Duleep has taken captive the court [in England], are his

Bhajan Lal’s statement in Login, _John Login_ , p. 247.
The Logins did, of course, develop affection for Duleep Singh. At one
point, Login wrote to his wife that he expected Duleep Singh to look
upon her as his mother (Login, _John Login_ , p. 214), and as early as
July 1850, he was considering prospective brides for the maharajah
(ibid., p. 220).

Lord Dalhousie quoted in Login, _John Login_ , p. 307.
Baird, _Letters_ , p. 156. Of course, almost at once, a nephew, son of
Maharajah Sher Singh, who had ruled before Duleep Singh, tried to
claim the title, for whatever it was worth. Dalhousie, however, made
it clear that the maharajah’s conversion did not negate his title. Yet,
Dalhousie would not even let Duleep Singh take a Sikh wife, so as to
to dilute his status—a case of eating his cake and having it too.
Login, _John Login_ , p. 230.
Baird, _Letters_ , p. 249. Emphasis added.
His age may have had something to do with this. When sent to India,
Dalhousie was only in his thirties.
In celebrating the takeover of Punjab, for instance, Dalhousie
presented it as much as a matter of pride for Britain as being for ‘the
future good’ of Indians now subject to the Company, thanking also
‘Almighty God’ for this ‘brilliant success’. See Baird, _Letters_ , pp. 62–
63.
This is not to say that religious interference was the sole cause of the
1857 Rebellion. There were multiple other grievances also around

See, for instance, Joshua Marshman, _Advantages of Christianity in_
_Promoting the Establishment and Prosperity of the British_
_Government in India_ (London: Smith’s Printing Office, 1813), p. 6,
where we read that ‘the most effectual means of perpetuating British
power’ was the ‘steady and constant diffusion of christian [sic] light
among the natives’.
For a critique of a disinterested Christianity, see William Wilberforce,
_A Practical View of the Prevailing Religious System of Professed_
_Christians in the Higher and Middle Classes in this Country,_
_Contrasted with Real Christianity_ (London: T. Cadell, 1797).
Correspondingly, after the defeat of Napoleon some years later,
British triumph was advertised as confirmation of god’s blessings for
Protestantism and its propagation.
Quoted in Carson, _The East India Company and Religion_ , p. 21. And
this sense of duty was sincerely absorbed. As one CMS missionary
would wonder in 1838, ‘the thought of 800 millions [in India] passing
into eternity every 30 years without a ray of hope often overwhelms
me, then I ask myself the question, am I doing my part to avert these
dire consequences?’ Quoted in Antony Copley, _Religions in Conflict:_
_Ideology, Cultural Contact and Conversion in Late-Colonial India_
(Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 9.
And indeed, many saw sin in Calcutta. See Karen Chancey, ‘The Star
in the East: The Controversy over Christian Missions to India, 1805–
1813’, pp. 510–11, in _Historian_ 60, 3 (1998): 507–22.

For instance, as the Third Report dated 13 May 1802 of the Religious
Tract Society put it: ‘We live in an age and in a country distinguished
by those inventions and improvements which indicate a highly
polished state of Society’. But these would be ‘advantageous or
prejudicial according to the principle which directs the use of them.
The art of Printing, for example’ could be used to disseminate ‘truth,
justice, purity and happiness’ but also ‘Infidelity and Debauchery’.
See _Proceedings of the First Twenty Years of the Religious Tract_
_Society_ (London: Benjamin Bensley, 1820), p. 32.
On this trend of individual Christians becoming the means of
throwing open salvation to non-Christians, see Joseph Stubenrauch,

(1771–1845), himself a cleric, criticized evangelicals as ‘quite insane’
for exposing ‘our whole Eastern empire to destruction, for the sake of
converting half a dozen Brahmans’. ‘Upon the whole,’ he added, ‘it
appears to us hardly possible to push the business of proselytism in
India . . . without incurring the utmost risk of losing our empire.’

Protestant Episcopal Society for the Promotion of Evangelical
Knowledge, 1857), p. 207. Elsewhere Wilberforce would speak of
‘Hindu divinities’ as ‘absolute monsters of lust, injustice, wickedness
and cruelty.’
As Susan Thorne observes, evangelicals saw the home and foreign
lands as ‘two fronts of the same war’ in promoting faith and Christian
values. See Thorne, _Congregational Missions and the Making of an_
_Imperial Culture in Nineteenth-Century England_ (Stanford: Stanford
University Press, 1999), p. 17.

missionary activity: ‘[C]ommerce shall subserve the spread of the
gospel.’ See Carey, _An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to_
_Use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens_ (Leicester: Ann
Ireland, 1792), p. 68. This idea, however, existed even in the
seventeenth century. See Das, _Courting India_ , p. 58.
Similarly, the first Church of Scotland missionary, Alexander Duff,
was the son of a gardener.
Quoted in Carson, _The East India Company and Religion_ , p. 143. See
also Susan Thorne, ‘“The Conversion of Englishmen and the
Conversion of the World Inseparable”: Missionary Imperialism and

_Colonial Cultures in a Bourgeois World_ (Berkeley: University of
California Press, 1997), pp. 238–62. One missionary himself wrote
how a colleague wanted to go to the West Indies to work as a clerk,
with hopes of becoming an officer. When that did not happen, he
became a missionary. See Potts, _British Baptist Missionaries in India,_
_1793–1837_ , p. 23. See also Pennington, _Was Hinduism Invented?_ , p.

_and British Public Life, 1770–1840_ (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press,
2019).
Carson, _The East India Company and Religion_ , p. 53. Carey and his
colleague were also expected to focus primarily on educational and
linguistic activities, not proselytism. See Dirks, _Castes of Mind_ , p. 26.
Indigo also evidently required only a part of the year to be dedicated
to it; the calculation was that for the rest of their time, the
missionaries could focus on selling religion.

William Bentinck, _Memorial Addressed to the Honourable Court of_

_Causes and Consequences of that Event_ (London: John Booth, 1810),
p. 71. Grant would dismiss this idea, suggesting that it was solely the
dead Tipu Sultan’s family, held in Vellore Fort, who orchestrated the
revolt. Historical consensus is that religious fears were a final
addition to more longstanding general grievances, waiting to come to
the fore through violence. Sympathy for Mysore also existed. See
Farooqui, _Colonial Subjugation_ , pp. 57–59.
See, for instance, Thomas Twining, _A Letter to the Chairman of the_

for the accomplishment of His grand evangelizing designs concerning
it.’ See Alexander Duff, _The Indian Rebellion: Its Causes and Results_
(New York: Robert Carter & Brothers, 1858), p. 255.
Why, ‘even the boldest opponents of attempts at evangelization were
at times anxious to avoid the accusation of indifference towards
missionary enterprise’. See Ingham, _Reformers_ , p. 11.
Carson, _The East India Company and Religion_ , p. 132.
Ibid., p. 139. As Ingham, _Reformers_ , p. 11, reminds us, this was not a
spontaneous show of support but very much a campaign organized
and instigated to achieve the goal of influencing lawmakers at that
critical moment.
See the full clause in Carson, _The East India Company and Religion_ ,

vote on the clause took place late at night, and many opponents had
already left. See Ian Copland, ‘Christianity as an Arm of Empire: The
Ambiguous Case of India under the Company, c. 1813–58’, p. 1031,

Carey agreed: ‘Men make themselves idols,’ he wrote, ‘after their

the height of folly’. Quoted in Potts, _British Baptist Missionaries_ , p.

Interestingly, as the Portuguese had tried to bind the Nasranis—or
Syrian Christians—in Kerala to (Catholic) Rome, Buchanan would
now attempt to tie these ‘native’ Christians to the (Protestant) Church
of England. See Buchanan, _Christian Researches_ , pp. 103–04.

this was among the questions raised before him. The swami ‘in a half

Or as C.F. Schwartz said, Jesus had commanded the apostles to

Chancey, ‘Star in the East’ for an exploration of rivalry between the

his successor, Bishop Heber, also disagreed with evangelical
portrayal of Hindus as depraved. Heber did not like their religion but
did not dismiss their culture or character as terrible. The occasional
temple could even move him. See Oddie, _Imagined Hinduism_ , p. 86–
92, p. 94, and Bearce, _British Attitudes_ , pp. 85–87.

Of course, in India, there was cooperation, joint excursions, etc. by
missionaries of these societies in the early years. See Potts, _British_
_Baptist Missionaries_ , p. 59.
Between 1780 and 1830, Britain’s reading population rose from an

There are still occasional reports. See this 2023 report titled ‘Minor

three including juvenile held’, _The Hindu_ , 11 January 2023: available
at [https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/silvassaminor-boy-beheaded-in-human-sacrifice-ritual-three-includingjuvenile-held/article66365833.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/silvassa-minor-boy-beheaded-in-human-sacrifice-ritual-three-including-juvenile-held/article66365833.ece) (accessed on 8 August 2024). See
also Dirks, _Castes of Mind_ , p. 174 on how talk of human sacrifice
enabled the expansion of the colonial state into tribal areas.
Between 1817 and 1827, 4323 cases of sati were recorded, of a total
population in India exceeding 150 million. Most of this was in
Bengal, while in Madras and Bombay, between 1815 and 1820, the
annual figures were under fifty. See Bayly, _Origins_ , p. 153. An
orientalist like H.T. Colebrooke noted in the 1790s that ‘instances of
widow’s sacrifices are now rare’, adding that asking Indians about
sati would show ‘how few instances have actually occurred’ in their
memory. See Colebrooke, _Essays_ , p. 75. However, BMS missionaries
and Buchanan could get away with declaring that Bengal alone saw
10,000 satis on an annual basis. See Ingham, _Reformers_ , p. 47.
Jorg Fisch, ‘Humanitarian Achievement or Administrative Necessity?
Lord William Bentinck and the Abolition of Sati in 1829’, p. 118 in
_Journal of Asian History_ 34, 2 (2000): 109–34. In 1813, thus, one sati
was aged two-and-a-half years. It must also be admitted that


-----

European horror on actually witnessing satis was genuine. In 1782, in
Maharashtra, thus, a woman was about to be burned but was rescued
by a party of white men. See Rosalind O’Hanlon, ‘Narratives of
Penance and Purification in Western India c., 1650-1850’, pp. 67–68,
in _The Journal of Hindu Studies_ 2, 1 (2009): 48-75. The mother of
William Jones’s pandit, Radhakant, also became a sati, aged eighty.
See Rocher, ‘The Career of Radhakanta Tarkavagisa’, p. 627.
Dirks, _Castes of Mind_ , p. 174.
Oddie, _Imagined Hinduism_ , pp. 220–21, p. 180. See also Thorne,
‘Missionary Imperialism’, p. 245 on how journals were dependent on
‘large numbers of small contributors’ for survival.
As a missionary wrote later in the century, if his fellow religious
professionals failed to properly impress ‘upon the minds of our
hearers in Christian lands’ a ‘clear and definite conception’ of the
‘soul-destroying influence of idolatry’, how could those readers ‘feel
the profound sympathy’ or pray with ‘such earnestness and
understanding as the occasion demands’? Besides, the ‘promise of
interesting information’ also ‘sometimes secures the attendance at
missionary meetings of those who otherwise might not take the
trouble to come’. See Mateer, _The Gospel in South India_ , pp. 11–13.
Oddie, _Imagined Hinduism_ , p. 217. Indeed, missionaries were
admonished for _not_ sending sufficiently graphic accounts for the
home readership.
Indians noted this in the same period. As _The Brahmunical Magazine_
complained in Bengal in 1821, ‘missionary gentlemen seldom
translate into English the Upanishads, the ancient Smritis, the Tantras
quoted by respectable authors, and which have always been
regarded’. See Jogendra Chunder Ghose ed., _The English Works of_
_Raja Rammohun Roy_ , Vol. 1 (New Delhi: Cosmo Publications, 1982),
p. 162.
Bateman, _Life of Daniel Wilson_ , p. 390. Alexander Duff would also
later write how his father exposed him to pictures of Jagannath, with
‘copious explanations, well fitted to create a feeling of horror towards

idolatry and of compassion towards the poor blinded idolaters’. See
Thomas Smith, _Alexander Duff_ (London: Hodder & Stoughton,
1883), p. 20.
Bayly, _Origins_ , p. 153. Missionaries could, amusingly, come up with
interesting mathematical calculations. One, noting how the number of
Christians in Bengal rose between 1783 and 1800 from six to fifty-six
projected future conversions at 392 in 1817, 2744 in 1834, 19,200 in
1851 and so on, until the population was fully Christian. See Potts,
_British Baptist Missionaries_ , p. 35.
See William Ward, _A View of the History, Literature, and Religion of_
_the Hindoos: Including a Minute Description of their Manners and_
_Customs, and Translations from their Principal Works,_ Vol. 2
(Serampore: Baptist Mission Press, 1818 ed.).
Ibid., p. lxxv. See also Oddie, _Imagined Hinduism_ , pp. 33–35, p. 164,
where we see missionaries investing in learning about Hindu
mythology for reasons ranging from wanting to undermine it to
wanting to look more approachable to ‘natives’.
See figures for 1815–28 in Fisch, ‘Humanitarian Achievement or
Administrative Necessity?’, p. 115. Even considering undercounting,
the highest figure in these years was just over 800 in 1818. Later
authorities agreed that sati was not a widespread custom. See

Before the book was published, Dubois made fresh edits and changes,
in which he advocated non-intervention in Hindu practices. However,
this updated version was not printed in English. It would only appear
later, in 1899, in a new translation. See Jean-Antoine (Abbe) Dubois

_Ceremonies_ (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1899), p. 97 and ‘Prefatory

of the text itself and Mill’s intellectual thinking, see Javed Majeed,
_Ungoverned Imaginings: James Mill’s The History of British India_
_and Orientalism_ (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992). Copley in
_Religions in Conflict_ , p. 38 goes further and calls Mill’s work ‘one of
the most condemnatory accounts of another culture ever written’.
Mill, of course, was also a creature of context, and there were diverse
influences informing his approach to history, India and British rule.
He believed, for instance, in history as the march of progress;
acknowledging a glorious Hindu past which then declined, as
orientalists argued, did not fit this world view. For a study exploring
this, see Jeng-Guo Chen, ‘James Mill’s “History of British India” in
Its Intellectual Context’, Unpublished PhD dissertation, University of
Edinburgh, UK (2000).
James Mill, _The History of British India_ , Vol. 1 (London: Baldwin,
Cradock & Joy, 1817), p. 152. For criticism of Mill and his project
from within British ranks, see Dirks, _Castes of Mind_ , pp. 37–38. Even
though Mill was using this to highlight the crudeness of Hindu
culture even in a supposedly past golden age, its effect was very
much to tarnish contemporary Hindus. On throwing women to dogs,
see also Sharma, _Modern Hindu Thought,_ pp. 149–50.
See Wagle, ‘Kotwal’s Papers’, pp. 35–36; Gokhale, _Poona_ , p. 167.
See Mill, _History_ , p. 158, where he remarks that adultery with a
Brahmin woman brought down punishment worse than that assigned


137

for ‘parricide’. Yet, in 1772, among the Marathas—under the
government of the Brahmin Peshwa—a man who committed adultery
with a Brahmin woman faced only confiscation of property. If
anything, it was women who were more strictly punished. See
Gokhale, _Poona_ , p. 167; Wagle, ‘Women’, p. 35; and Uma
Chakravarty, ‘Wifehood, Widowhood, and Adultery: Female
Sexuality, Surveillance and the State in 18th Century Maharashtra’,
pp. 12–13, in _Contributions to Indian Sociology_ 29, 1 and 2 (1995):
3–21. In Bengal, in 1807, a woman accused of adultery had to face
trial by ordeal but again was spared dog attacks. See Chunder,
_Travels of a Hindoo_ , p. 47. It is possible there were violent
punishments elsewhere, but the point is that Mill’s generalizations
must be identified as that: generalizations, devoid of context.

Christian Precepts with their own books.’ The matter went up to the

dependents—and bring them to Protestantism—would, in fact, birth
cleavages with local Hindus. See Susan Bayly, ‘Hindu Kingship and
the Origin of Community: Religion, State and Society in Kerala,
1750–1850’, in _Modern Asian Studies_ 18, 2 (1984): 177–213. This

those whom Providence has placed to rule over them.’ Even

violence against ‘native’ Christians were acquitted when two antimissionary judges disagreed with their colleague, a pro-missionary
judge. All three judges were eventually sacked by the governor. See

sin.’ See Copley, _Religions in Conflict_ , p. 11.

the right granted to converts to retain inheritance and claims in their
families. Conversion, that is, could not be cited to deny them a share
of property—something that sounds reasonable now, but at the time
overturned the logic of caste and family.

Reference is to Joshua Marshman. See ibid., p. 20. Much later, the
missionary Robert Caldwell would also write from south India about
his ‘spiritual fishing’:

What varied interest and excitement there is in spiritual
fishing!—were it not that I fear to make sacred
comparison walk on all fours, I could tell how often I
am tantalized with ‘nibbles’, how excited I feel when I
get a ‘bite’, how I exult when a fish is safely landed,
and how sometimes when an innocent perch is quietly
nibbling at my bait, a great old pike, the persecutor of
his neighbourhood, makes a rush at him and swallows
him up. Though my fishing is on a small scale, the
proportion of the fish I catch that seem fit only to be
cast away is as large, I fear, as if I caught thousands at a
time. I rarely indeed cast any away, for the proper time
for doing so is yet to come, but I notice now and again,
on scrutinizing what I have got, certain unwholesome
looking fish, or slippery, slimy creatures, half fish, half
snake, which are not likely to fare well when the angels
sit down on the eternal shore and separate the good
from bad. Not frequently, indeed, fish of that sort do not
wait to be rejected, but find their way into the water as
fast as they came out of it.

Marshman, _The Life and Times of Carey, Marshman, and Ward_ , Vol.
1, p. 138.
Quoted in Potts, _British Baptist Missionaries_ , p. 91. Carey also
wanted Serampore to become a ‘Christian Benares’ with missionaries
investing in Sanskrit—chiefly to use that language to turn the tide of
Sanskrit literature ‘completely on the side of Christianity’. Sanskrit,
he believed, was like a ‘golden casket’ filled with pebbles; the
missionary proposal was to replace those pebbles with Christian
riches. Quoted in Richard Fox Young, _Resistant Hinduism: Sanskrit_

course, equally there were difficulties also, including insincere
conversions. As late as 1831, there were converts who threatened to
give up the faith if not paid. See Potts, _British Baptist Missionaries_ ,
pp. 45–46. So too Protestant missionaries often had to tolerate caste
differences, even if not to the same degree as Catholics. See Oddie,
_Hindu and Christian_ , p. 175.
Nasranis, or ‘Syrian Christians’ as they were called, in Kerala were
also harassed by Protestant missionaries who saw in their rites and
customs too much ‘heathenism’ and ‘vile papistry’. Nasranis
maintained rituals of purity like high-caste Hindus; Protestant
missionaries now began to appear at their festivals, denouncing their
practices, and ‘then intentionally laying hands’ on them. ‘The crowds
would flee in order to avoid the defiling touch of the foreigner, and
the missionaries reported gleefully on their ability to break up whole
festivals in this way.’ See Bayly, _Saints, Goddesses and Kings_ , p. 299.

Christians were never more than vain phantoms . . . for in embracing

towards which they always kept a secret bent . . . there is no
unfeigned, undisguised Christian among these Indians’. Quoted in
Mohan, ‘British and French Ethnographies’, p. 237. However as
Copley notes in _Religions in Conflict_ , p. 54, quite a few Indians were

attracted to Christianity even if they did not actually convert. See also
ibid., p. 70.

This too was a general habit: as one missionary in Orissa suggested,
using ‘pertinent quotations from their own books’ not only drew
people to listen, but also ‘increases their respect for your character’.

Of course, comical moments also emerged. Once a Christian catechist
accused a Hindu religious figure of profiting from the public’s
gullibility, only to be accused of ‘preaching for a livelihood’ rather
than any loftier purpose. ‘Who,’ it was asked, had _really_ ‘seen
Heaven or Hell?’ See Kooiman, _Conversion and Social Equality_ , p.
188.

Brahmins in the earlier debate with Wilson’s associate also made this
point, declaring that if Christians had Jesus as a great saintly figure,
Hindus had quite a few such who hadn’t needed to die to ‘save’ them.

Different Symbolic World Vision’, p. 337, in Robinson and Clarke
eds., _Religious Conversion in India_ , pp. 323–50. Equally, many _did_
also convert for gains of a non-spiritual nature. In Travancore, thus,
one missionary saw much keenness, only to realize that the intending
converts hoped he would use his connections with the local rajah to
help them. See Kooiman, _Conversion and Social Equality_ , p. 75. In
Tamil country, shepherds offered to ‘think about Christianity’ if paid
Rs 5 each. See Copley, _Religions in Conflict_ , p. 152. See also George

Catholic church’s and Catholic missionaries’ dealings with old Indian
Christian groups such as the Nasranis, who had rites and a culture
alien to Europeans. A late-eighteenth-century memoir by a Nasrani
not only laments the loss of his community’s autonomy from the
Portuguese period onwards, but also complications born of their
being placed under spiritual leaders of a different race. At one point
he even uses the word ‘slavery’. See Thomman Paremmakkal (J.

seemed rigged, letting partisan interests prevail. But its principal
quality was that it turned the language of morality against the
colonizer, using their own standards and religion to spotlight imperial
sins. India’s woes, thus, stemmed from a single cause: that so ‘great
an Empire’ was ‘given in monopoly to a body of voracious
Merchants’. Nothing in history, our writer declared, ‘could
approximate’ to this travesty ( _Bombay Gazette_ , 20 August 1841) a
line of argument that, interestingly, mirrored those of the Company’s
early critics like Edmund Burke. On a concise summarization of the

Should the Christian attempt to ridicule some part of the

shall also remind him of the corruptions introduced by
various sects into Christianity.

Having read about the rise and progress of Christianity
in apostolic times, and its corruption in succeeding
ages, and then of the Christian Reformation which
shook off these corruptions . . . I began to think that
something similar might have taken place in India, and
similar results might follow from a reformation of the
popular idolatry.

While there was an admission of crisis in Hinduism here, it yet
denounced Catholicism as degraded. Quoted in Collet, _Life and_
_Letters_ , p. 162.

Killingley, _Rammohun Roy_ , p. 118. He also later objected to a
painting that depicted Christ with pale skin.
This excludes, of course, a work he claimed to have written in his
teens, which was never published.
Rammohun Roy, ‘A Present to the Believers in One God: Being a
Translation of Tuhfatul Muwahhiddin’, _English_ _Works_ , pp. 941–58.
There is a question to be asked as to why Roy never translated the
_Tuhfat_ into English, as he did with his later Bengali works. See also
Sen, _Rammohun Roy_ , p. 24.
One translator even titled the text in English as _A Gift to Deists._
Enlightenment-era radicals and those who challenged religious
orthodoxy were often lumped under the term ‘Deists’.
See Dasgupta, ‘Ethics, Distance and Accountability’ particularly on
the likely influence of the _Akhlaq-I Nasiri_ on Roy’s thought. See also
Rudrangshu Mukherjee, ‘Rammohun Roy’s “Gift”: His First
Published Piece’ at [https://www.theindiaforum.in/article/rammohunroys-gift](https://www.theindiaforum.in/article/rammohun-roys-gift) ; and Killingley, _Rammohun Roy_ , p. 48.

and ‘Humble Suggestions to his Countrymen who Believe in the One
True God’ (1823), ibid., p. 211. Nanak is also mentioned in the
_Tuhfat_ . See ‘A Present to the Believers’, p. 955. Interestingly, British
observers found Deist parallels in the ‘religion of well-educated

Hindus’ elsewhere also. See Fanny Parkes, _Wanderings of a Pilgrim_
_in Search of the Picturesque: Four-and-Twenty Years in the East;_
_with Revelations of Life in the Zenana_ , Vol. 2 (London: Pelham
Richardson, 1850), p. 288.
Robertson, _Raja Rammohan Ray_ , p. 20, p. 27.
See, for example, Rammohun Roy (‘A Friend to Truth’), _An Appeal_
_to the Christian Public in Defence of the ‘Precepts of Jesus’_ (New
York: B. Bates, 1825), which makes this point.
As Roy argued, if sati were divine in origin, it would have been
universal, whereas it was not even universal in India. Besides, sati
offered very material incentives for men under the ‘cloak of religion’:
the ‘destruction of the widow’ removed her claim to a share of
property. See Roy, ‘Some Remarks in Vindication of the Resolution
Passed by the Government of Bengal in 1829 Abolishing the Practice
of Female Sacrifice in India’ (1832), in _Essential Writings_ , p. 167.
See also ‘Translation of a Conference between an Advocate for, and
an Opponent of, the Practice of Burning Widows Alive’ (1818) in
ibid., p. 120. It must be noted, however, that Roy’s alternative—a life
of romantic self-denial for widows—won’t be particularly pleasing to
today’s readers either.
There are subtle differences between the Bengali originals and
English versions, given that these were intended for different
audiences. Importantly, Roy’s Bengali writings also ‘contributed
meaningfully to the development of modern Bengali prose’. See Sen,
_Rammohun Roy_ , p. 4. See also ibid., p. 15.
He himself notes this. See, for instance, ‘Translation of an
Abridgment of the Vedant’ (1816), in _Essential Writings,_ p. 3 _,_ and ‘A
Second Defence of the Monotheistical System of the Vedas’, ibid.,
pp. 83–84. And recent scholarship suggests he succeeded in this,
achieving considerable popularity. See Dasgupta, ‘Ethics, Distance
and Accountability’, p. 128, pp. 134–41. In fact, Dasgupta notes,
though their content was anti-missionary, even the BMS press
produced hundreds of copies of his writings later, because they had a

lucrative market. See also Hatcher, _Hinduism before Reform_ , p. 206
for how in the 1820s, Roy was being discussed even in Gujarat. On
the count of language, however, it has been observed that Roy’s
Bengali was still a ‘learned’ kind, and not the ordinary Bengali of the
masses. See Killingley, _Rammohun Roy_ , pp. 40–41.
Rammohun Roy, ‘Abstract of The Arguments Regarding the Burning
of Widows, Considered as Religious Rite’ (1830), in _English Works_ ,
p. 367.
For example, Roy wrote of his debt to H.H. Wilson’s dictionaries in
doing his translations from Sanskrit. See Roy, ‘Translation of the
Ishopanishad’, _Essential Writings_ , p. 22. He also collaborated with
the BMS missionaries in attempting a Bengali translation of the
Bible. See Sugirtharajah, _The Brahmin and His Bible_ , p. 1. By this
time, his English language skills were also strong. See Killingley,
‘Rammohun Roy’, p. 298, in Bauman and Voss Roberts eds., _The_
_Routledge Handbook_ .
Or as Sen writes, ‘Hindus were quick to realize that “reform” was not
just about altering beliefs or practices, but invariably touched upon
deeper questions of self-identity.’ See Amiya P. Sen ed., _Social and_
_Religious Reform: The Hindus of British India_ (New Delhi: Oxford
University Press, 2003), ‘Introduction’, p. 3.

Bayly, _Empire and Information_ , p. 213.

universal category, recognizable to all people everywhere, see

might find it in a certain Rig Vedic verse; but modernizers, if they
wished to claim that caste is a gradual evolution—and, thus, could be
reversed—might cite another ancient verse from the Yajur Vedic
corpus to back _their_ argument. Similarly, in the _Vajrasuchi_
_Upanishad_ , we find an argument against birth-based caste. See K.
Narayanasvami Aiyar, _Thirty Minor Upanishads_ (Madras, 1914), pp.
110–12. Importantly, Roy’s critics also cited Vedic and other Sanskrit
verses to back their arguments. See Roy’s own ‘Translation of a
Conference’, _Essential Writings_ , pp. 114–18. See also Arvind
Sharma, ‘The Hindus as a Textual Community’, p. 5 on the idea of
‘lost Vedas’—that is Vedas in addition to the extant four—and that
any practices for which direct authority from the existing Vedas
cannot be found could be ascribed to the ‘lost’ ones. This made room
for acknowledging other faiths also. See also K. Satchidananda

University, 1959), p. 234.

Roy himself noted that his version of Hinduism was ‘well-known’ to
‘learned Brahmans’ even now, when most Hindus had forgotten their
actual religion: a hint that his innovations were not entirely alien. See
Killingley, ‘Rammohun Roy’, p. 297, in Bauman and Voss Roberts
eds., _The Routledge Handbook_ , pp. 297–306. On philosophical
diversity in Hinduism, see Andrew Nicholson, _Unifying Hinduism:_
_Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History_ (New York:
Columbia University Press, 2010), pp. 24–29.
As Jaiswal notes, in Hinduism ‘orthodoxy is to be proved in the realm
of ritual and social behaviour’ such as caste practices, temple
worship, etc., ‘but there is no such insistence in the realm of ideas’.
Roy, that is, could believe what he wanted—so long as he did not
attack the _practice_ of Hinduism. See Suvira Jaiswal, ‘Semitising
Hinduism: Changing Paradigms of Brahmanical Integration’, p. 20, in
_Social Scientist_ 19, 12 (1991): 20–32.
This is a more nuanced position from the claim that modern
Hinduism simply appropriated Western ideas and gave it a Hindu
provenance. The ideas were not, as such a Western monopoly, even if
it was under British domination that Indians arranged them a certain
way. Or as Weiss puts it, ‘rich resources for modernization’ existed
within Hinduism. See Richard S. Weiss, _The Emergence of Modern_
_Hinduism: Religion on the Margins of Colonialism_ (Oakland:
University of California Press, 2019), p. 17. Brian Hatcher also
emphasizes not the impact of the West on Hinduism but a
‘convergence’ of Western ideas with Hindu ones. See also Killingley,
‘Vedanta and Modernity’, p. 127, where he notes how this was the
time when ‘Hinduism became aware of itself as a religion’.
Contemporaries also sensed this, as seen in these disapproving but
telling words by Governor General Hastings: ‘Since their [Hindus’]
intercourse with us they have endeavoured to connect and reconcile
their legends . . . to find something abstrusely emblematic in the
nonsense.’ Quoted in Chatterjee, _Representations of India_ , p. 99.

Of course, the same saints might sometimes treat god as _sagun_ —with
qualities—and sometimes as _nirgun_ —without relatable qualities:
proof again of how both trends existed in India.
Sumit Sarkar, _Essays of a Lifetime: Reformers, Nationalists,_
_Subalterns_ (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2019), p. 6.
See also Sen, _Rammohun Roy_ , pp. 73–78.
As Sen writes, ‘reform was perceived as an interventionist act in
which a historical figure was acutely aware of his moral and social
roles’, and in this case, particularly with the hope that he ‘could
replicate a European-style reformation in colonial India’. See Sen,
_Rammohun Roy_ , p. 5.
For what translation represented, see Dirks, _Castes of Mind_ , pp. 145–
46.
See in this context Dasgupta, ‘Ethics, Distance and Accountability’,
p. 322, where we see how Roy demonstrated that he was a far better
judge of what India was ready for compared to missionaries; the latter
sold something unsuited to Indian soil, while he identified what might
work. See also Sen, _Rammohun Roy_ , p. 20 for how, despite all this,
there were young Bengalis who saw Roy as too cautious.
Padmanji, _Once Hindu_ , _Now Christian_ , p. 4, pp. 6–7, p. 26, p. 34, p.
37, p. 55. Later scholars have also, sadly, been susceptible to such
thinking. See, for example, V.T. Samuel, _One Caste, One Religion,_
_One God: A Study of Sree Narayana Guru_ (New Delhi: Sterling
Publishers, 1977), p. 16, which describes Kerala’s religious practices
as an ‘incongruous mixture’—as if congruity is a necessary universal
standard.
Wendy Doniger cited in Pennington, _Was Hinduism Invented?_ , pp.
169–70.
Not all missionaries though. Caldwell, although without admiration,
accurately wrote, for example, some decades later:

. . . it is the peculiar policy of the Brahmans to render
all religious systems of India subservient to their


-----

purpose by making friends of them all. Brahmanism
repudiates exclusiveness; it incorporates all creeds,
assimilates all, consecrates all. People are permitted to
entertain any opinions they please, and to practice any
ceremonies they please, provided only that the
supremacy of the Vedas and of the Brahmans is duly
acknowledged. When that acknowledgment has been
duly made, the new heterodoxy becomes another new
authoritative orthodoxy, especially revealed by the
Supreme Being himself for the enlightenment and
salvation of the particular class of people amongst
whom it has become popular. Thus Brahmanism yields
and conquers; and hence, though the demon worship of
Tinnevelly is as far as possible repugnant to the genius
of orthodox Hinduism, and was not only independent of
it in origin but, as I believe, long anterior to it, yet even
it has received a place in the cunningly-devised mosaic
of the Brahmans, and the devils have got themselves
regarded as abnormal developments of the gods.

See Robert Caldwell, _Lectures on the Tinnevelly Missions:_
_Descriptive of the Field, the Work, and the Results_ (London: Bell &
Daldy, 1857), p. 42.

Retrospective because in the immediate years after his death, his
name and ideas dissipated. Only many years later was Roy and the
Brahmo Samaj properly revived, receiving patronage and support
from new members with their own ideas. See Brian A. Hatcher,
_Bourgeois Hinduism, or the Faith of the Modern Vedantists: Rare_
_Discourses from Early Colonial Bengal_ (New York: Oxford
University Press, 2008), p. 5.
‘Trust Deed of the Brahma Samaj’ (1830), _Essential Writings_ , p. 105.
See in this regard Bayly, _Indian Society_ , pp. 163–64. Numerically
also, Brahmoism remained small: in 1881, out of over 187 million
Indians, less than 1150 Hindus returned themselves formally in the
census as Brahmos. See Weiss, _Emergence of Modern Hinduism_ , p. 6.

Brahmoism may have had more influence than these numbers suggest
but even so, its overall impact was modest.
Robertson, _Raja Rammohan Ray_ , p. 12, and Sen, _Rammohun Roy_ , p.
48.
Roy, _The Precepts of Jesus: The Guide to Peace and Happiness;_
_Extracted from the Books of the New Testament_ (Calcutta: Baptist
Mission Press, 1820), p. xxviii. Others noticed this too. ‘The
Hindoos,’ one commentator wrote, ‘never doubt any part of the
miracles and prophecies of our scripture . . . the only thing that
surprises them is, that they should be so much less wonderful than
those of their own scriptures . . . If a Christian of respectability were
to tell a Hindoo, that . . . St Paul had brought the sun and moon down
upon the earth . . . he would immediately be put in mind of something
still more extraordinary that Krishna did . . .’ See W.H. Sleeman,
_Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official_ , Vol. 2 (London: J.
Hatchard & Son, 1844), pp. 51–52.
See Sugirtharajah, _The Brahmin and His Bible_ for more. Marshman,
the BMS man, was Roy’s chief critic at this time in the first half of
the 1820s. Interestingly, Roy’s stance won him supporters among
Unitarians—who also took a rationalist approach to the Bible—in
Britain and America both, helping build his celebrity abroad.
Two generations later, Chattampi Swamikal (1853–1924) in Kerala
would employ a similar formula in his _Kristhumatha Chedanam_ ,
where contradictions, inconsistencies and logical failings within
Christian scripture are highlighted to negate its claims.
This was later done in western India also, during debates between
Hindus and missionaries. See, for example, Young, _Resistant_
_Hinduism_ , p. 26.
On this, see also Sharma, _Modern Hindu Thought_ , pp. 99–105.
Sugirtharajah, _The Brahmin and His Bible_ , pp. 36–45. This stance
would become popular. See for example Rajnarayan Bose’s lecture,
‘Superiority of Hinduism to other Prevailing Religions’, summarized
in _Allen’s Indian Mail_ , 28 October 1872.

Quoted in Sugirtharajah, _The Brahmin and His Bible_ , p. 57. Roy also
remarked once to someone who thought he would convert: ‘My Lord,
you are under a mistake. I have not laid down one superstition to take
up another.’ See Sen, _Rammohun Roy_ , p. 86. See also David Kopf,
_The Brahmo Samaj and the Shaping of the Modern Indian Mind_
(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1979), p. 13.
Vishnubawa Brahmachari, who we met in the previous chapter, made
similar claims. See Conlon, ‘The Polemic Process’, p. 14.
Roy, _English Works_ , p. 882. Missionaries had noted this difference, of
course, while conceding that behind the diverse practices was ‘some
sort of cohesion or basic unity’. See Oddie, _Imagined Hinduism_ , pp.
150–51. See also Davis, _Lives of Indian Images_ , p. 48.
Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, _Letters on Hinduism_ (Calcutta: Prabasi
Press, 1940 ed.), p. 12.
Ibid., p. 11. Amusingly, Chatterjee’s words proved prophetic: in 1908,
a Bengali prince, wrote of his ‘rude shock’ in Italy, where the
Catholic church, he wrote, ‘instead of enlightening their flocks . . .
teaching them the Truth of Religion’ fed people ‘a form of idolatry’
centred on the Madonna. See the epilogue to this book.

_West in Nineteenth-Century Bengal_ (Delhi: Oxford University Press,
1988), chapter three. For his stressing of a Hindu identity in his work,
see Bhagat-Kennedy, ‘Imagining Bharat’, chapter two.
Chatterjee, _Letters on Hinduism_ , pp. 45–46. See also, Basu, _Hindutva_
_as Political Monotheism_ , p. 112, where we read of Bankim’s
‘disinterest’ in an ‘austere and esoteric Vedic monotheism’, which is
too ‘abstract . . . to animate a flock and a nation’. Instead, he desired a
‘rational transcription of Puranic cultures and institutions’. Another
writer in 1894 also argued that while Vedic Hindus were not idolaters,
post-Vedic Hindus were; a situation that ‘would hardly be called
progress’ by Western standards. And yet it was the latter who were


-----

‘more advanced than the Vedic Hindus in literature, science, arts and
manufactures’. Idolatry, that is, was not by itself proof of decline or
corruption. See Pramatha Nath Bose, _A History of Hindu Civilisation_
_During British Rule_ , Vol. 1 (New Delhi: Asian Publication Services,
1978 [1894]), p. ii.
Not permanently, evidently. In 1846, the remains were removed again
and cremated in Calcutta. The shrine at Arnos Vale cemetery still
stands, however, and receives pilgrims even now. See Sen,

Jain monks in Kathiawar who questioned idol worship. Kathiawar
also had other Hindu religious figures who made similar arguments.

This discomfort with sensuality in religious literature became a
general trend. In the twentieth century, one critic would ask if, for
example, Kshetrayya’s seventeenth-century verses were ‘proper or
safe’ now? There was also a tendency to suggest that the erotic
represented higher meaning and not anything _really_ sensual. See
Ramanujan, Rao and Shulman, _When God Is a Customer_ , pp. 28–29.

Something similar would transpire with Christians too. Low-caste
converts in Travancore, for instance, were discriminated against even
in missionary establishments. Poyikayil Yohannan (1879–1939) set
up his own sect blending Christian principles with the cultural
practices of his people. Missionaries called him a heretic, while his

followers saw in him a prophet. By the 1950s, he would be deified.
See Mohan, _Modernity of Slavery_ , chapter four.

misreading of the true meaning of certain terms. Asvamedha, or horse
sacrifice, for instance was merely about good government. For

Quoted in John E. Cort, ‘Indology as authoritative knowledge: Jain
debates about icons and history in colonial India’, p. 146, in Dodson
and Hatcher eds., _Trans-Colonial Modernities_ , pp. 137–61. See also
Chemparathy, ‘Some Observations’, p. 232 on how Dayananda did
indeed ‘interpret the Vedic texts in such a way as to make them suit
his own ideas’. Even now, there are Hindu-run websites angrily
‘exposing’ Dayananda.
_Satyarth Prakash_ , p. 67, p. 123. See also p. 234, where he dismisses
the Brahmana section of the Vedas as only commentaries, not part of
the original texts. See also p. 337, where he adds that if there was
truth in the Puranas, those parts must have come from the Vedas; the
rest was falsehood.
Ibid., p. 291. America is equated with Patala—the netherworld—in
_Satyarth Prakash_ . This idea was later expanded on by Chaman Lal in
_Hindu America: Revealing the Story of the Romance of the Surya_
_Vanshi Hindus and Depicting the Imprints of Hindu Culture on the_
_Two Americas_ (Bombay: New Book Co., 1940), with the hope that
Hindus would one day ‘reclaim America’. Interestingly, the book
carries an image of Gandhi at the start and was published with
endorsements from two future Indian presidents: Sarvepalli
Radhakrishnan and Rajendra Prasad, in addition to other major public
figures.
_Satyarth Prakash_ , pp. 294–96. Dayananda’s guru also saw the great
war of the Mahabharata as a historical cut-off point to distinguish
between pure Hindu learning and corrupted, inferior scriptural
production. See also Jones, _Arya Dharm_ , pp. 32–33.
Supporters also reveal this attitude, when, for example they describe
Brahmins as ‘monopolists of religion’. See Sarda, _Life of Dayanand_
_Saraswati_ , p. lvii. See also Salmond, _Hindu Iconoclasts_ , pp. 84–85.
_Satyarth Prakash_ , p. 311, p. 319, p. 341.
Jordens, _Dayananda Sarasvati_ , p. 71.
Ibid., p. 312, p. 317, p. 436, p. 475, p. 501. With Islam, Dayananda
specifically meant the Black Stone (al-Ḥajar al-Aswad) at the Kaaba.


-----

He did not, however, have adequate knowledge of Jainism and often
mixed it with Buddhism: a tendency that invited criticism. Rectifying
this, he cited more Jain sources in the second edition of _Satyarth_
_Prakash_ . See Cort, ‘Indology as authoritative knowledge’. For more
on Dayananda’s polemics against Christianity, including a
lampooning of circumcision, of Jesus’s disciples ‘eating’ their guru
and of Jesus being a carpenter, see Kenneth W. Jones, ‘Swami
Dayananda Saraswati’s “Critique of Christianity”’, in Kenneth W.
Jones ed., _Religious Controversy in British India: Dialogues in South_
_Asian Languages_ (New York: State University of New York Press,
1992), pp. 52–74. The attacks on Christianity and Islam do not exist
in the first edition of _Satyarth Prakash_ , but as Jordens, _Dayananda_
_Sarasvati_ , p. 97 shows, this was only to avoid a delay in publication;
those sections had already been written and would be carried in the
updated edition.
Some of his supporters would later explain that this was all done in a
constructive spirit; in any case, it is argued that Dayananda’s
statements met the needs of his time, whereas in the twentieth
century, conditions changed. See Sarda, _Life of Dayanand Saraswati_ ,
pp. lxxxviii–xc.
Jordens, _Dayananda Sarasvati_ , pp. 78–79. See also Jones, _Arya_
_Dharm_ , p. 34.
Jordens, _Dayananda Sarasvati_ , pp. 79–81. Evidently, it was also here
that a Brahmo leader suggested that he cease preaching in Sanskrit
and use Hindi instead. Urban India also brought Dayananda in
contact with interesting people: R.C. Dutt, for example, who became
a future Indian National Congress president; the revolutionary
Shyamji Krishna Varma, etc. Ironically, later in life, Dayananda
would have a falling out with the Brahmo Samaj in Punjab. See
Jones, _Arya Dharm_ , pp. 40–42.

Sarda’s _Life of Dayanand Saraswati_ even includes instances where
Dayananda divines events and things, much to the surprise of his
enemies and followers both.

_Arya Samaj: An Account of Its Origin, Doctrines, and Activities, with_

The maharajah’s brother, Sir Pratap Singh of Idar, does seem to have
absorbed Dayananda’s views. As he would later write, Puranic
Hinduism represented a ‘Dark Age’ when Hindus ceased being
attentive to ‘their true religious scriptures’, the Vedas, and reduced
their faith to ‘a collection of grotesque fancies and a bundle of
superstitions’ worthy of ‘ridicule’. The ‘later-day Brahmins’ were
blamed for this, caring for their ‘self-interest’ and fabricating all
kinds of nonsense. However, ‘purified of these later accretions’, the
Vedic religion was capable of commanding ‘the approbation of the
thoughtful’ including, of course, ‘scholars of the West’. See R.B. Van
Wart, _The Life of Liuet.-General Sir Pratap Singh_ (London: Oxford

Religious Change in India, 1880–1916’, pp. 291–92, in _Modern Asian_
_Studies_ 20, 2 (1986): 285–319. As for Hindu unity, as an Arya Samaj
member would write, ‘The chief weakness of Hinduism lay in it
being a vast sea of contradictory doctrines and beliefs, which made it
an impossible religion for active propaganda work and which laid it
open to the attacks of those who aimed in India to convert Hindus.’
See Rai, _The Arya Samaj_ , p. 113.
He once declared: ‘What can be a more heartrending pain than the
fact that this country is being ruined by the sighs of the widows, the
piercing cries of the orphans, and the slaughter of cows?’ See Sarda,

also raised such issues in personal discussions, evidently, with British
officials. See Sarda, _Life of Dayanand Saraswati_ , p. 47, p. 57.
See instances in Robb, ‘The Challenge of Gau-Mata’, p. 296. See also

have ten principles, which were general enough to ensure that ‘no
Hindu, at any rate, should have any difficulty in subscribing’ to them.
See Rai, _The Arya Samaj_ , p. 103.
Quoted in Robb, ‘The Challenge of Gau-Mata’, p. 303. This was not
new. Cow-protection had been political for long, and in 1806, in
upper India, the Company themselves banned it to ‘silenc[e] the
clamors of the adversaries of the British’ who painted them as cowkillers. They were referring also to Jaswant Rao Holkar, the Maratha
ruler of Indore, who around 1805 attempted to build an anti-British
alliance of states, using cow-protection as a plank. See Sugata Ray,

For a comparison of the two Samajs as early as 1893, see Salmond,
_Hindu Iconoclasts_ , p. 65.
Dayananda even criticized Brahmo Samajists for being too fond of
English and of British habits. See Jones, _Arya Dharm_ , p. 40.

Among those impressed with the Arya Samaj was a schoolteacher
called Krishn Behari Vajpayee, whose son, Atal, would in time
become India’s first prime minister from the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP’s predecessor, the Jana Sangh,
was also, interestingly, inaugurated in an Arya Samaj school in Delhi.

Samaj became more tolerant of Puranic Hinduism; as a missionary
observed, in western India, while it still emphasized the Vedas, ‘it
does not oppose itself in practice to traditional customs. Hence,
membership in the Samaj does not mean breaking away from the
past.’ See J.E. Abbott in _Report of the Fourth Decennial Indian_

appears to have been favourably looked upon by Dayananda early in
his career. See Sarda, _Life of Dayanand Saraswati_ , p. 54. See also
Jordens, _Dayananda Sarasvati_ , pp. 169–70. See also Jones _, Arya_
_Dharm_ , pp. 47–49. There are stray instances from Indian history
where this was done earlier also: the Maratha general Netaji Palkar
converted to Islam and served the Mughals, only to return to the
Hindu fold in due course. See also other instances in Hirozhi
Fukazawa, _The Medieval Deccan: Peasants, Social Systems and_
_States: Sixteenth to Eighteenth Centuries_ (Bombay: Oxford
University Press, 1991), pp. 96–97; and, including of a Brahmin, in
O’Hanlon, ‘Narratives of Penance’, pp. 62–64.
This did not please everyone. As Gandhi wrote, Dayananda had
‘made . . . Hinduism narrow’. Quoted in Sharma, _Hinduism as a_
_Missionary Religion_ , pp. 36–37. See also Sharma, _Modern Hindu_
_Thought_ , p. 183 for a remark by Gandhi that he could not ‘let a
scriptural text supersede my reason’. On my use of the term
‘evangelical’ here: the Samaj also, in time, began to ‘include the
conversion of non-Hindus and even those whose ancestors had never


-----

been Hindus’. Many Sikhs, for example, began to see the Samaj as a
threat to their own identity. See Kenneth W. Jones, ‘Communalism in
Punjab: The Arya Samaj Contribution’, pp. 47–50, in _The Journal of_
_Asian Studies_ 28, 1 (1968): 39–54. Of course, there were those within
the Arya Samaj who were scandalized by _shuddhi_ schemes in which
low-caste groups were welcomed into the fold, this sometimes
leading to violence. See Lee, _Deceptive Majority_ , p. 87, p. 92.
It is not entirely without reason that admirers of Dayananda highlight
not only his spiritual achievements but also his bodily strength, which
could terrify, we read, wrestlers, princes and even the occasional wild
animal. Many of these appear in Sarda, _Life of Dayanand Saraswati_ ,
emphasizing the ‘masculine’ religion Dayananda promoted.

‘mahapandit’ (great scholar) and so on—all in snark.
This struggle itself, as Kumar, notes was old. Colonialism just offered
fresh agency to lower-caste groups. See Kumar, _Political Agenda of_

not help us in analyzing their role in colonial societies’. See Mohan,
_Modernity of Slavery_ , p. 19. See also ibid., pp. 68–69, where we find

some reference to religion’. See also O’Hanlon, _Caste, Conflict, and_

the south put it, the Bible ‘is a book which no man can read without
being entangled’. See Hudson, ‘Life and Times of H.A. Krishna
Pillai’, p. 224.

Or as one scholar puts it, ‘Jotirao Phule’s writings against
Brahminism utilized forms of speech and rhetorical styles associated
with the rustic language of peasants but infused them with demands
for human rights and social equality that bore the influence of
nonconformist Christianity to produce a unique discourse of caste
radicalism.’ See Anupama Rao, _The Caste Question: Dalits and the_
_Politics of Modern India_ (Berkeley: University of California Press,
2009), p. 39.
O’Hanlon, _Caste, Conflict, and Ideology_ , p. 111. In Kerala, decades
later, the anti-caste movement would draw inspiration from Booker T.
Washington’s _Up from Slavery_ . See Mohan, _Modernity of Slavery_ , p.
50.
Tschurenev and Mhaskar, ‘Wake up for Education’, p. 2, in fact, call
her ‘the first published woman poet in modern India’. It is also said
that given their childlessness, when Phule’s father asked him to take a
second wife, he refused. He would later write how if women were not
awarded matching rights, men had no business taking more than one
spouse either. See Phule, _Sarvajanik Satyadharma Pustak_ (‘Universal
Religion of Truth’), p. 470, in _Samagra Vangmay_ , pp. 443–560.

See Chiplunkar, _Nibandhamala_ , p. 465. In 1887, Phule would,
incensed by an intellectual’s critique of Christianity, attack the latter
as ‘a drunkard and a fool’, suggesting a strategic sympathy with
missionaries. See Rahul Sarwate, ‘Reimagining the Modern Hindu
Self: Caste, Untouchability and Hindu Theology in Colonial South
Asia, 1899–1948’, Unpublished PhD dissertation, Columbia
University (2020), p. 37. As late as 1925, a Marathi polemicist, G.M.
Nalwade, was able to write a book titled _Satyashodhak ka_
_Christasevak_ ( _Truthseeker or Servant of Christ?_ ) (Pune: G.N.
Nalwade, 1925), with a foreword by Phule’s own relative, calling him
both a traitor to his faith and his country. Another relative, Baburao
Phule, would accuse Jotirao of being a Christian convert. In the
book’s foreword, we also read a line suggesting how were one to
consume the book without knowledge of its author, one might think it
was authored by a missionary. But Phule was hardly alone in his
views. In 1876, Bholanath Chakravarti, in Bengal, for instance,
declared British rule India’s ‘good fortune’—though for him this was
because the British saved Hindus from Muslim ‘oppressions’. We
will see more of this line of thinking in the next chapter. See
Chatterjee, _Nation and Its Fragments_ , p. 94. The Tamil lower-caste
intellectual Iyothee Thass Pandithar (1845–1914) would also be seen
as a loyalist of the Raj. See, for example, A.R. Venkatachalapathy,
_Swadeshi Steam: V.O. Chidambaram Pillai and the Battle against the_
_British Maritime Empire_ (Gurugram: Allen Lane, 2023), pp. 345–46.

Great Rebellion. See _Gulamgiri_ , p. 188.
Sharma, _Modern Hindu Thought_ , p. 156. See also ibid., p. 139, where
we read how Hinduism’s ‘primary thrust is to secure order in the
midst of anarchic pluralism . . . rather than to secure justice within an
already established order. It may be simply too busy establishing
order to do so’. See also Parekh, ‘Some Reflections’, p. 20, where we
read how Hindus saw society ‘not [as] a collection of individuals but
a community of communities’. For a critique and the limitations of
this pattern, see Tagore, _Nationalism_ , pp. 137–38.

This formula—where the missionary and English education save the
downtrodden—appears in the same era elsewhere in India also, for
instance, in Potheri Kunhambu’s Malayalam novel _Saraswati Vijayan_
(1892). Kunhambu also, like Phule, saw Brahmins as the root of
much evil in Hindu society. See Dilip M. Menon, ‘Caste and Colonial

Quoted in Richard M. Eaton, _A Social History of the Deccan, 1300–_
_1761: Eight Indian Lives_ (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
2005), p. 129. Elsewhere he wrote:

Pride of caste has never made any man holy . . . The
untouchables have crossed the ocean of life by Goddevotion . . . Gora, the potter, Rohidasa, the shoemaker, Kabira, the Muslim, Sena, the barber,
Kanhopatra, the concubine . . . Chokhamela, the outcast
. . . Janabai, the maid, have all become unified with God
by their devotion. The Vedas and the Sastras have said
that for the service of god, castes do not matter.

Quoted in R.D. Ranade, _Mysticism in India: The Poet–Saints of_
_Maharashtra_ (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1983), p.
326.

This is also linked to O’Hanlon’s point that missionaries alone could
not have provoked such changes and calls for reform unilaterally. See
O’Hanlon, _Caste, Conflict, and Ideology_ , p. 52.
As Zelliot notes, even if Dalit ‘grievances were voiced chiefly against
the Brahmin’, it was the non-Brahmin Maratha peasantry that
‘dominated at the village level’. See Eleanor Zelliot, ‘Learning the
Use of Political Means: The Mahars of Maharashtra’, p. 44, in Rajni
Kothari ed., _Caste in Indian Politics_ (New York: Gordon & Breach,
1970), pp. 29–69. This was an obstacle in Phule’s creation of a broadbased Sudra identity. See also Gail Omvedt, _Cultural Revolt in a_

_Caste, Conflict, and Ideology_ , p. 208, where she notes that Phule did

ideological needs of a popular movement’. See also Prachi

be continued by committed Phuleites. A 1925 polemic, for instance,
somewhat crassly questions the paternity of several Brahmin
Peshwas. See ‘Satyashodhak’ Dinkarrao Javalkar, _Deshache_

_Gulamgiri_ , pp. 158–59. See also p. 165, where we read that the term
‘raksasa’, which is used for demons in Sanskrit texts, was derived
from ‘raksaka’ (protector), which referred again to the original
inhabitants and rulers of India, and _Sarvajanik Satyadharma Pustak_ ,
p. 475, p. 487. See also O’Hanlon, _Caste, Conflict, and Ideology_ , pp.
152–60, and Omvedt, _Cultural Revolt_ , p. 115. Phule may, in this,
have picked up one something truly felt in marginalized communities.
In Kerala too, for example, Dalit communities spoke ‘about their
former free and elevated position’; of having once been rulers. See
Kooiman, _Conversion and Social Equality_ , p. 77.
For other criticism, see Deshpande, _Creative Pasts_ , p. 112.
For Narayana Guru’s critique of caste and religion, see his
_Jatimimamsa_ and _Matamimamsa_ , respectively. The guru also
quipped: ‘If caste is necessary, let everyone be a Brahmin.’ Quoted in

Arattupuzha Velayudha Panikkar.

positive for marginalized castes. A key disciple, the poet Kumaran
Asan, also asked what swaraj, or political liberty, meant when Indians
—‘mad with caste prejudices’—fought among themselves. See T.K.

replaced with something more acceptable; and Samuel, _One Caste,_

Maharashtra also: Four decades after Phule died, the Dalit Mahar
community also resolved to stop eating ‘the flesh of dead cattle’ and
‘of sacrificial chicken and goats’; to avoid alcohol at religious
ceremonies; to greet one another using high-caste forms; to cremate
the dead, in the fashion of upper-caste groups, instead of burying
them and so on. See Oliver Mendelsohn and Marika Vicziany, _The_

_Untouchables: Subordination, Poverty and the State in Modern India_
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 98. For Gandhi
later promoting a similar approach, see Lee, _Deceptive Majority_ , p.
155. Earlier, from the 1820s, in Chhattisgarh, Chamars, a low-ritual
status group, also adopted vegetarianism and so-called ‘pure’ habits,
by this claiming a higher position for their caste. See Pandey,
_Construction of Communalism_ , p. 89.
Omana, ‘Devotion and Dissent’, p. 360.
Or as Ravindran puts it, the guru ‘felt no necessity or urge for
reforming the Hindu religion. He only restated [its] fundamental
principles’. See Ravindran, _Asan and Social Revolution_ , p. xxx.
See, for instance, Toshie Awaya, ‘Some Aspects of the Tiyyas’
“Caste” Movement with Special Reference to British Malabar’, p.
153, in H. Kotani ed., _Caste System, Untouchability and the_
_Depressed_ (New Delhi: Manohar, 1997), pp. 139–68. The same
happened with his contemporary, Chattampi Swamikal (1853–1924),
who was popular with the Nair community. See, for instance, tales
recorded in K.P.K. Menon, _Chattambi Swamigal: The Great Scholar–_
_Saint of Kerala_ (Trivandrum: P.G. Narayana Pillai, 1967), where we
read about snakes coiling up comfortably round his arm, of ferocious
dogs and tigers rendered tame in his presence and of sceptics
overpowered by his magical energies (not to speak of his immense
stamina).
Posthumously, of course, as has often happened with radical
ideologies in India before, Phule’s legacy was tamed somewhat when
his successors cast him as a truer defender of Hinduism. For example,
see Javalkar, _Deshache Dushman_ , p. 25.
O’Hanlon, _Caste, Conflict, and Ideology_ , pp. 120–21 for an instance
as early as the 1850s.

p. 7.
Ramasswami, _Viswaguna Darsana_ , p. 46. The _Sahyadrikanda_ of the

Maharashtra whereby they would have to serve Sudras. See
Deshpande, ‘Ksatriyas in the Kali Age’, p. 112.
This claim, interestingly, has something of a precedent from south
India, where as early as the seventeenth century, lower-caste
representatives complained of Brahmins holding most important
posts under the British, preventing others’ voices from reaching their
rulers. See Kruijtzer, _Xenophobia_ , pp. 135–36.
_Gulamgiri_ , p. 134; _Shetkaryacha Asud_ , p. 263.
_Gulamgiri_ , pp. 135–36. For the Madras University figures, see Pillai,
_False Allies_ , p. 459. Brahmin domination in government employment
was a major issue in south India in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, including in princely states such as Travancore
and Mysore.

about how, when attending the wedding of a Brahmin classmate from
his mission school, Phule, used to a mixing of castes in the
classroom, got a jolt when, for the first time, he was insulted on
account of his caste by Brahmins.

Ibid., pp. 5–6. In the south, the Theosophical Society also took a
similar position when it suggested that ‘untouchable’ castes be given
‘useful and practical training’ instead of being prepared for university.
Besides, if they were born into a low caste, it was—as per the theory
of karma—due to their own ‘misdeeds in a former birth’. See
Pandian, _Brahmin and Non-Brahmin_ , pp. 36–37.
Rao, ‘Educating Women and Non-Brahmins’, p. 8.
Mani, ‘Introduction’, p. 3. Incidentally, Gandhi took a similar view
romanticizing the peasant.

A peasant earns his bread honestly. He has ordinary
knowledge of the world . . . He understands and
observes the rules of morality. But he cannot write his
own name. What do you propose to do by giving him a
knowledge of letters? Will you add an inch to his
happiness? Do you wish to make him discontented with
his cottage or his lot? . . . Carried away by the flood of
western thought, we came to the conclusion that we
should give this kind of education to the people.

Natesan, 1921 ed.), p. 88.

another authority, while these men were ‘sympathisers’, Phule did not
permit them to become members of the Samaj. See M.S. Gore,

This was Sayajirao Gaekwad III of Baroda, who considered Phule
India’s own Booker T. Washington. Phule’s work also impacted the
young Maharajah Shahu of Kolhapur, a state where in future there
would be major Brahmin-non-Brahmin conflicts, with the ruler siding
with the non-Brahmins. For a concise account, see Omvedt, _Cultural_

Poem 34, _Savitribai Phule Samagra Vangmay_ . Fittingly, the
University of Pune (Poona) is today named after Savitribai. The
emphasis on education was also perhaps a response to a somewhat
smug critic’s remark that lower castes could have no way to access
education without Brahmins’ support; and that, therefore, Phule
should be more circumspect in his criticism. See Naregal, _Language_

Ambedkar was the man who would tell Gandhi:

Gandhiji I have no homeland . . . How can I call this
land my own wherein we are treated worse than cats
and dogs, wherein we cannot get water to drink? No
self-respecting Untouchable worth the name will be
proud of this land . . . If in my endeavour to secure
human rights for my people who have been trampled
upon in this country for ages I do any disservice to this
country, it would not be a sin; and if any harm does not
come to this country thorough my action, it may be due
to my conscience.

Quoted in Rao, _The Caste Question_ , p. 159. Like Phule, Ambedkar
also did not hesitate to lampoon Hindu gods such as Rama and
Krishna. See, for instance, Vasant Moon ed., _Dr Babasaheb_
_Ambedkar: Writings and Speeches_ , Vol. 4 (New Delhi: Ambedkar

sage Narasimha Saraswati.
See Omvedt, _Cultural Revolt_ , p. 56. See also Laine and Bahulkar
eds., _Sivabharata_ , p. 27 (hereafter ‘Sivabharata’), where we read how
even if Shivaji never saw Ramdas as his guru, the latter might have
intellectually buttressed the former. Some sources place their first
meeting in the 1640s; others in the 1670s. The issue remains
controversial. See Laine, _Shivaji_ , p. 52.
This was the Nizam Shahi—a kingdom governed by Shia Muslim
dynasty of Brahmin descent—which fell in the 1630s, and which
Shivaji’s father had defended. For a history of the sultanate, see
Pillai, _Rebel Sultans_ .
In the _Sabhasad Bakhar_ , thus, one of the oldest sources on Maratha

Note, however, that this was only one way in which Shivaji
conceptualized kingship, for one audience. In practice he could also
play down religion, and focus on a _regional_ patriotism, in which a
neighbouring sultan—the Qutb Shah of Golconda—was a legitimate
ally. See Kruijtzer, _Xenophobia_ , pp. 157–58, pp. 169–71, pp. 184–85.

The _Sabhasad Bakhar_ , p. 184, thus shows him as led by the goddess,
while in the _Sivabharata_ , p. 45, p. 88, pp. 91–93, we find Shivaji
described as Vishnu incarnate. Afzal Khan himself becomes a kind of
sacrificial offering.
_Sivabharata_ , pp. 51–52, pp. 77–79, p. 84. Arguably, this also
maintained ideological space for Shivaji to engage with some
Muslims without compromising his broader ideology.

Kruijtzer, _Xenophobia_ , p. 267. See also Laine, _Shivaji_ , p. 41 for
another example of Shivaji’s appeal to religion. Shivaji’s deeds also
inspired people elsewhere; an eighteenth-century Hindi panegyric to
Chattrasal Bundela, a younger contemporary of the Maratha hero,
presents Shivaji telling the former: ‘Go back home and defeat the
Mughals.’ The Bundela king is accordingly roused and goes to war.

To quote Kruijtzer, the closing years of Shivaji’s career down until
1687 is where the ‘roots of modern communalism’ might be found.
See Kruijtzer, _Xenophobia_ , pp. 8–9.

in their ‘house’; but in the end, brown men remained its legal
masters. See Tilak, _Writings and Speeches_ , p. 276.

Indians. See Gopal, _Lokamanya Tilak_ , pp. 28–29. See also Robert E.

_Ballads of the Marathas,_ p. 10.
Quoted in Wolpert, _Tilak and Gokhale_ , p. 86. Or as Tilak would state
in 1905, Shivaji killed Afzal Khan not from personal hatred but
because he stood in the way of progress. See _Samagra Lokamanya_

Quoted in Wolpert, _Tilak and Gokhale_ , p. 84. For other criticism of
British plague policy, see _Samagra Lokamanya Tilak_ , Vol. 4, pp. 715–
22.
Amusingly, when the plague broke out in Bombay soon after, some
orthodox Hindus blamed it on this insult to royalty! See E. Washburn
Hopkins, ‘The Divinity of Kings’, p. 314, in _Journal of the American_
_Oriental Society_ 51, 4 (1931): 309–16.
He was not entirely wrong. A Protestant missionary, wrote in 1868
how ‘education de-Hinduizes the Hindu, breaks down idolatry, and
inspires him with a distaste for it, and a latent desire to be free from
it’. Boys trained at mission schools and government institutions were
‘scandalized by idolatry, and are somewhat ashamed of it’. Indeed,
‘there is not one who does not hold Hinduism with a lighter and
looser grasp than formerly’ than he whose mind had been ‘expanded
and benefited by the education he has received’. See M.A. Sherring,
_The Sacred City of the Hindus: An Account of Benares in Ancient and_
_Modern Times_ (London: Trubner & Co., 1868), p. 350.
On this, a scholar writes: ‘The intensity of the resentment toward all
reformers manifested in [Chapekar’s autobiography] has no equal in
the published records of the period.’ See Charles H. Heimsath, _Indian_
_Nationalism and Hindu Social Reform_ (Princeton: Princeton

with the murder.

full judgment, see _Queen-Empress vs. Bal Gangadhar Tilak and_
_Keshav Mahadev Bal_ in _Indian Law Reports (Bombay Series)_ , Vol.
22, pp. 112–51. His sentence was for eighteen months, but he was
granted early release. Interestingly, one of his lawyers in this case,
Dinshaw Davar, later became the judge who sentenced him in his
1908 sedition case. In that second case, one of Tilak’s lawyers was
M.A. Jinnah (1876–1948), who later founded Pakistan.
Damodar Chapekar, despite the tone of his autobiography, did submit
in 1898 a petition professing innocence and claiming to have been
framed. See petition dated 8 March 1898 in _Source Material_ , Vol. 2,

See Upton, ‘Take out a thorn with a thorn’, p. 2. In later years too,
Tilak would insist he was speaking of the ‘spirit’ of Shivaji’s deeds,
and not literally. See, for example, Tilak, _Writings and Speeches_ , p.
46, p. 50 and p. 70. Yet, as Kapila writes, Tilak’s thought ‘did make
violence possible, plausible and conceivable’. See Shruti Kapila, ‘A
History of Violence’, p. 180, in Devji and Kapila eds., _Political_
_Thought in Action_ , pp. 177–99. Interestingly in the 1940s, a viceroy
would note that a ‘double-tongued’ Gandhi too made ‘vaguely
worded’ pronouncements that could be ‘interpreted in whatever sense
best suits him at a later stage’.

_Samagra Lokamanya Tilak_ , Vol. 6, p. 792. Of course, one could
quibble with Tilak here that Hindustan originally used to refer to

would also throw in veneration of the Gita and the Ramayana. See
Tilak, _Writings and Speeches_ , pp. 35–36. Tilak denied other ways of
defining Hindus. Caste, for instance: even Christian converts retained
caste, so this could not be a defining parameter of Hinduism. Hindu
law was another: Hindus had been around long before the British
courts began operating Hindu law. Even philosophical definitions
were not satisfactory. See _Samagra Lokamanya Tilak_ , Vol. 5, pp.
278–84, and Vol. 6, p. 789.

For one, as much as Tilak wished Hindus to assert power as one
community, our firebrand was less keen to upset hierarchies within.
On social reform, as alluded before, while a degree of change was
tolerable—in the 1890s Tilak himself caused scandal by taking tea
with Europeans—a more fundamental questioning was suspect.
(Heimsath, _Indian Nationalism_ , p. 24.) Decades later, when asked
why he did not eat with non-Hindus and Hindus of other castes, Tilak
would say: ‘[Y]ou see my work is amongst the people of
Maharashtra. I must respect their prejudices . . . If I adopt the
heterodox ways, I would not be in a position to influence them to the
same extent as I could do by keeping to my orthodox ways.’ (See
Bapat, _Reminiscences_ , pp. 7–8.) This selective approach to change
continued: when asked how he could go abroad when it was banned
for good Hindus by tradition, Tilak quipped: ‘We Maratha Brahmans
do not allow our religion to interfere with our politics.’ (Quoted in
Wolpert, _Tilak and Gokhale_ , p. 283. Tilak appears to have inherited
this approach from his mentor, Vishnushastri Krushnashastri

Chiplunkar. See Deshpande, _Creative Pasts_ , p. 113.) He offered logic:
reform excited an English-educated minority while most Hindus were
orthodox. ‘Social reform,’ then, ‘can never be popular’. (Quoted in
Gopal, _Lokamanya Tilak_ , p. 110.) Nationalism had to win over all
Hindus, and this could not be done while also assaulting their beliefs.
To him, thus, ‘there [was] no inherent connection between social
reform and national regeneration’; insistence on reform might even
sink the anti-British movement. (Gopal, _Lokamanya Tilak_ , p. 214.) Or
as he wrote,

One party [his own] wishes to draw to the Congress as
large a portion of the public as it possibly can,
irrespective of the question of Social Reform; the other
does not wish to go much beyond the circle of friends
of reform. The real point at issue is whether the
Congress . . . is to be a Congress of the people or of a
particular section of it.

This was the opposite of a leader like C. Sankaran Nair, who in 1897
said that ‘even greater’ than ‘political emancipation’ was ‘the
necessity for social and religious reform’. (See Heimsath, _Indian_
_Nationalism_ , p. 216.) This also set Tilak apart from other Hindu
leaders such as M.G. Ranade (1842–1901), who, not unlike Roy in
Bengal, interpreted reform as a return to purity. The social evils
reformers were fighting, thus, were to Ranade ‘excrescences upon
the healthy system of ancient Hindu Society’. He also did not believe
government intervention was bad: a ‘diseased corruption’ in the body
politic needed not small pills but a ‘sharp surgical operation’. (See
Ranade, _Miscellaneous Writings_ , p. 81.) Tilak countered mulishly by
calling them misrepresentations. ‘If you don’t know how to interpret
the Shastras correctly, then at least try to remain silent.’ (Quoted in
Wolpert, _Tilak and Gokhale_ , p. 55. See also _Samagra Lokamanya_
_Tilak_ , Vol. 5, p. 253, where he accuses reformers of picking and

As a formula this is not without precedent in India. Saivas in the
medieval period, who had their own internal differences and various
sects, clarified their common identity _as Saivas_ by pushing a
‘negative representation of Jains’ as the Other. See Peterson,
‘Sramanas against the Tamil Way’.

Ibid., pp. 492–94. See also Kosambi, _Pandita Ramabai_ , p. 209.
Tilak’s dislike of Ramabai was old: as early as 1882, when she began
reform work among women, Tilak’s _Kesari_ disapproved. See ibid., p.
29. Her conversion to Christianity made things worse; unsurprisingly,
figures like Phule supported her on this.

Tilak himself notes the practice. See _Samagra Lokamanya Tilak_ , Vol.
4, p. 17. It was not just Hindus. Though strictly speaking, Sunni
Muslims were not to participate in this Shia affair, in practice Sunnis
across India did. See Pandey, _Construction of Communalism_ , p. 34.
Notably, in the seventeenth century, a Brahmin minister in Hyderabad
was noted as sponsoring lavish Muharram functions, though this was
put down to a desire to ‘increase his fame’—in private he ‘mock[ed]’
the proceedings. See Kruijtzer, _Xenophobia_ , p. 248.

Tilak, _Writings and Speeches_ , pp. 48–50.
Quoted in Samarth, _Shivaji_ , p. 67. This is very different from his tone
in a 1907 article where he describes Shivaji as ‘a Hindu king with a
deep yearning for religious freedom fighting against the galling
oppression of Mohammedan rulers’. Quoted in Rao, ‘Religious
Identity’, p. 30.
Tilak, _Writings and Speeches_ , p. 174. See also ibid., p. 46 for a 1906
speech where Tilak speaks of how love of the nation was ‘one’s first
duty.’ Religion came second. See also _Samagra Lokamanya Tilak_ ,
Vol. 6, p. 485.
Tilak, _Writings and Speeches_ , pp. 141–42. Tilak added in this speech
that even white men who were devoted to India were not alien. Read
another way, however, this equates ‘good’ Muslims with ‘good’
Englishmen—but not with Hindus on whom no requirement of ‘doing


-----

good’ is placed as a test of Indianness. See also _Samagra Lokamanya_
_Tilak_ , Vol. 6, p. 466, p. 475. See also Bhagat-Kennedy, ‘Imagining
Bharat’, pp. 67–68 for how in an earlier time, Bankim Chandra
Chattopadhyay in Bengal also, in using the term ‘Bengali’ applied it
to Hindus alone.
He also played a key role in enabling the ‘Lucknow Pact’, seen as
critical to making Congress acceptable to Muslims. See also Yadav,
‘Tilak’, p. 48, pp. 51–55.

This was targeted specifically at his rival, G.K. Gokhale. See also

See Tilak, _Writings and Speeches_ , pp. 379–81. See also Wolpert,
_Tilak and Gokhale_ , p. 200 for Tilak’s dismissal of ‘constitutional
politics’, on the ground that India had no constitution to start with;
and Gopal, _Lokamanya Tilak_ , p. 275, where he compares moderates
to Shivaji’s father, who continued to serve the sultanates even as his
son rebelled and launched an independent kingdom.
Quoted in Bapat, _Reminiscences_ , p. 34. The irony is that this
endorsement comes from Jinnah—the man who, in a few decades,
would cleave out the state of Pakistan, convinced that Muslims could
never be equal citizens in a Hindu-governed India. See also Khoday,
‘The Lokamanya and the Sardar’, p. 51, p. 55.
Quoted in Sarwate, ‘Reimagining the Modern Hindu Self’, p. 83.
See _Samagra Lokamanya Tilak_ , Vol. 4, p. 18, where as early as 1894,
he notes efforts to undermine Hindu unity by pushing divisions
between Brahmins and other castes.

for most part, while non-Brahmins too is a somewhat vague category
in which nonBrahmins. _dominant_ non-Brahmins claimed to speak for _all_

_Brahmin and Non-Brahmin_ , p. 67, and ibid., p. 76 for nineteenthcentury criticism that Brahmins in positions of official authority also
imported traditional caste stigmas and prejudices into these positions;
and Rao, _Beyond Macaulay_ , p. 117, p. 197, p. 238 for how in
education, under the Raj, Brahmins became dominant as teachers.
Quoted in Cashman, _Myth of the_ _Lokamanya_ , p. 201. See also
Pandian, _Brahmin and Non-Brahmin_ , pp. 70–71 for a similar
statement from Madras in 1919, which suggests that peaceful, nationbuilding Brahmins were better leaders than non-Brahmins who had
‘more sinews than brains’.
Gopal, _Lokamanya Tilak_ , p. 401.
Quoted in Khoday, ‘The Lokamanya and the Sardar’, p. 57. Tilak
appears later to have changed his mind on the question of Indian
participation in the British Army, using this as a means to negotiate
for self-government and also to obtain for Indians weapons training.
See _Samagra Lokamanya Tilak_ , Vol. 6, pp. 757–65.
Writing in 1879 the Governor of Bombay observed that educated
Brahmins ‘preach “unity” among Hindoos . . . as may subordinate
caste distinctions to political necessity . . . But elder Brahmins of a
stiffer disposition . . . would not surrender their Brahminism even for
the sake of expelling the British’. Tilak seemed to combine both
positions. See letter dated 9 July 1879 from the Governor of Bombay
to the Viceroy in Hambly, ‘Mahratta nationalism before Tilak’, p.
156. For a similar view of Tamil Brahmins, see N.K. Venkateswaran,
_Glimpses of Travancore_ (Trivandrum: S. Gnanaskanda Iyer, 1926),
where we read:

Progressive in politics and retrogressive in religion, [the
Tamil Brahmin] often yet appears to be unreligious and
illiberal. He will not dig up his roots from the old world
nor cut off his shoots from the new. He is, therefore, a
contradiction and an enigma . . . While he keeps open

house for the ideas of these times, he is unreasonably
reluctant to abandon the crude notions of a bygone age.

The Dalit leader Ambedkar, in fact, described Tilak as ‘one of those
social tories and political radicals with whom India abounds’. See
B.R. Ambedkar, _What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the_
_Untouchables_ (Bombay: Thacker & Co., 1945), p. 13.

wealthy non-Brahmins of rank in a tone of superiority. See also

We speak here primarily of the Chitpavan Brahmins of Maharashtra
who rose under the Peshwas. In this they displaced the Deshastha
Brahmins—an older elite and rival Brahmin subcaste—and it was
Deshasthas who assisted the East India Company, as described in
Chapter 3. That said, the Brahmins of the Deccan as a whole were
suspected not just by the British but older imperial powers also; the
first Nizam of Hyderabad (a subordinate of the Mughal emperor) in
the eighteenth century declared that they were only ‘fit to be killed

As late as 1911, there were newspaper debates on whether
Chitpavans should even be accepted as proper Brahmins. See _Indu_
_Prakash_ , 12 April 1911, in _Report on Native Papers Published in the_
_Bombay Presidency for the Week Ending 15th April 1911_ , South Asia
Open Archives, IOR at
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/saoa.crl.25636799](https://www.jstor.org/stable/saoa.crl.25636799) . In his early
journalistic career, Tilak also tried to encourage unity among
Brahmins through intermarriage between subcastes. See _Samagra_

Orthodox Brahmins believed there were no Kshatriyas in the kali

like the Mammoth’. See Chunder, _The Travels of a Hindoo_ , Vol. 1

Quoted in Dhananjay Keer, _Shahu Chhatrapati: A Royal_
_Revolutionary_ (Bombay: Popular Prakashan, 1976), p. 37.
Cashman, _Myth of the Lokamanya_ , pp. 115–18. See also Keer, _Shahu_
_Chhatrapati_ , p. 145 for an account of a 1907 meeting between Tilak
and Shahu. Tilak was willing to acknowledge Shahu as a Kshatriya in
his capacity as king of the Marathas, but not his wider caste group. In
his dispute with Brahmins, Kolhapur’s ruler was also encouraged by
colonial officers. See Cashman, _Myth of the Lokamanya_ , p. 118. See
also Phadke, _Shahu Chhatrapati Ani Lokamanya_ , pp. 104–05.
In 1894, Kolhapur had sixty Brahmins to eleven non-Brahmin
officers—this when Brahmins numbered only a few thousand among
a million subjects. Keer, _Shahu Chhatrapati_ , p. 41. Shahu’s attitude
was also noted by Damodar Chapekar when his brother applied for a
job in Kolhapur. The maharajah evidently said that he did not employ
Poona Brahmins. Chapekar writes sarcastically: ‘As soon as these
precious words fell from their lips, (my brother) formed an estimate
of their Kshatriya origin.’ See ‘Autobiography’, p. 968. For an
account of what Shahu represents today, see Gail Omvedt,
‘Maharashtra: Politics of Culture: “Rajarshree Shahu University
(Pune)”’, in _Economic and Political Weekly_ 29, 33 (1994): 2128–29.
See also Ian Copland, ‘The Maharaja of Kolhapur and the NonBrahmin Movement, 1902–10’, in _Modern Asian Studies_ 7, 2 (1973):
209–25.
Partly under Phule’s influence, he had long ago limited expenditure
on the ritual feeding of Brahmins. He had no desire, he would
remark, for encouraging ‘laziness’ in ‘able-bodied persons’. See the
maharajah’s 1926 speech in Widgery, _Speeches and Addresses_ , pp.
509–10.
Tilak, in fact, believed that Hinduism’s diversity depended on caste;
that caste in principle allowed each component of the wider whole its
own space to thrive. See _Samagra Lokamanya Tilak_ , Vol. 5, p. 143.
Tilak, of course, would have responded by arguing that reform was
welcome but slowly and incrementally. His critics would have


-----

countered by questioning how he could opt for radicalism in politics
and moderation in social affairs. Or as B.R. Ambedkar noted, ‘It is
foolish to take solace in the fact that because the Congress is fighting
for the freedom of India, it is, therefore, fighting for the freedom of
the people of India and of the lowest of the low.’
Omvedt, ‘Non-Brahmans and Nationalists’, p. 207.
Reference is to Sir M. Visvesvaraya, who presented the issue as one

pp. 93–94 notes also how the Congress in Madras, dominated by
Brahmins, was sarcastically compared to an _agraharam_ (Brahmin
colony).

Its origins evidently lie in the Mitra Mela, an organization Savarkar

‘Independence and Liberty I look upon as the very pulse and breath

Tilak’s pictures, Savarkar’s book became a popular possession with
revolutionaries across India. See for example report dated 29
December 1914 by the Director of Criminal Intelligence in Files No.
278–82, Home Dept (Political-B), January 1915, NAI, where a
revolutionary in Punjab was found with a copy. Even after Savarkar’s
anti-Muslim turn, the Muslim leader Asaf Ali would in the late 1920s
present a copy to his wife. ‘I was thrilled by it,’ Aruna Asaf Ali wrote.
‘It politicized me.’ See T.C.A. Raghavan, _Circles of Freedom:_
_Friendship, Love and Loyalty in the Indian National Struggle_ (New
Delhi: Juggernaut, 2024), p. 173. For a brief discussion of its
historiographical infirmities, see Wagner, _The Great Fear_ , pp. 12–14.
On Savarkar being a successor of sorts to Tilak, an admirer would
write: ‘Tilak and Savarkar held identical views. In fact, Savarkar

would go a step ahead of Tilak.’ See Nathuram Godse (Gopal Godse
ed.), _May It Please Your Honour_ (Delhi: Surya Prakashan, 1989), p.

revolutionary, it was ‘conducive to revolution’. See V.D. Savarkar

On the Gita’s influence on Savarkar, see Chaturvedi, _Hindutva and_
_Violence_ , pp. 70–71. Gandhi disagreed with this reading of the Gita,
observing how ‘Savarkar and others used to tell me that the Gita and
the Ramayana taught quite the opposite of what I said they did.’ See
Gandhi, _Hind Swaraj_ , p. xxvii.

Savarkar at this time, though this may well have been due to Tilak’s
own imprisonment in Burma, which had softened his paper’s tone.

_Tale of My Exile_ (Pondicherry: Arya Office, 1922), p. 50.
Savarkar, _Majhi Janmathep_ , pp. 117–19, pp. 177–78, p. 279. See also
pp. 174–75, where we read how prisoners would try and deliberately
fall ill so to be spared the cruel everyday work in prison. Some
pretended even to be mad, eating their excreta to prove it.
Savarkar’s account makes it appear as if he became a kind of prison
leader. Ghose, however, does not single out Savarkar as a special
inmate, and mentions him only once in passing in his prison memoirs.
Yet another source reports that after 1915, Savarkar was actively
docile in his relations with the prison authorities. See Dhirendra K.
Jha, _Gandhi’s Assassin: The Making of Nathuram Godse and His_
_Idea of India_ (Gurugram: Vintage, 2021), p. 22.

submitted a now-untraceable petition.

Sampath, _Echoes_ , Appendix 3, p. 470. See also ibid., p. 82, where,
interestingly, as early as 1906, a government report notes that he was
‘ruining his own life for he is yet but a raw boy not fitted to preach
opinions which he scarcely understands’. Tilak had also issued
similar warnings. See ibid., p. 72. Savarkar’s younger brother also
made efforts for his release. See correspondence in File No. 354,
Home Dept (Political), 1921, NAI, for instance.
Sampath, _Echoes_ , p. 355. See also ibid., p. 312.
Savarkar seems to have been embarrassed by this. After all, he once
told colleagues that their path was ‘bloody’; there would tortures ‘to
break your will’. Revolution was for those who could bear it. See

Sampath, _Echoes_ , p. 71. With his own will broken, his line changed.
In his prison memoirs, he notes how conditions in prison tended to
make men forget their values. But they must be respected for ‘past
service, patriotism and self-sacrifice’. See Savarkar, _Majhi_
_Janmathep_ , p. 79. Parchure’s hagiographical _Tatyarao Savarkar_ also
makes no mention of his petitions to the British, again suggesting
awkwardness.
Bakhle, for instance, concludes that Savarkar was ‘playing a political
game’ and ‘wrote whatever he thought might help get him back to
India and the political arena’. See Bakhle, _Savarkar_ , p. 62, p. 65. But
even if he was just fed up, that would be understandable. Just poor
health in prison could break people. In the 1940s, for instance, the
Congress leader Syed Mahmud would also write an ingratiating letter
to the British, after which he too was released. See Raghavan, _Circles_
_of Freedom_ , pp. 250–51.
In 1921, thus, Savarkar had already been moved from the Andamans
back to mainland India. His final prison, interestingly, was at
Yerwada in Pune, which once housed both Tilak and the Chapekars.

Ibid., p. 213. This caused one official to remark that Savarkar
‘accepts the letter [of the conditions laid down] for his own safety,
but never respects the spirit’. Quoted in Sampath, _Contested Legacy_ ,
p. 17. In 1934, he was also once detained, and his house searched.
See ibid., p. 157.
Ibid., pp. 261–62, p. 274. As late as the 1940s, even books _about_
Savarkar were prohibited. See ibid., p. 314.
Ibid., pp. 277–89. Chaturvedi suggests that Savarkar himself authored
this, while others like Sampath believe it was a close associate.
Savarkar is, again, often lampooned for praising himself in a
biography he likely wrote, but as Chaturvedi shows, the anonymous
authorship was a product of his context.
See Bakhle, _Savarkar_ , pp. 68–75, pp. 106–07.
Quoted in Sampath, _Contested Legacy_ , p. 72.
Savarkar, _War of Independence,_ pp. vii–viii, pp. 62–63.
Ibid., p. 10, p. 444.
Ibid., pp. 62–63, p. 162. An earlier Bengali writer, Bhudeb
Mukhopadhyay, accepted Muslims, stating that while Hindus were
born of India’s womb, Muslims were India’s foster-children. Here
again, we see that combination of acceptance with rejection, noted in
the Introduction. See Chakrabarti, _Local Selfhood_ , p. 204, and
Chatterjee, _Nation and Its Fragments_ , p. 111.
Savarkar, _War of Independence_ , p. 443. In this, Savarkar echoes
Ranade, who saw the failure of the Marathas—motivated by a desire
to assert ‘Hindu nationality’—in a previous generation as an
‘education’. See Ranade, _Rise_ , p. iv.
Savarkar in a speech quoted in Sampath, _Echoes_ , p. 90.
Yet, even in this phase, he did occasionally slip into anti-Muslim
rhetoric. See Bakhle, _Savarkar_ , p. 47. It could also be argued that
Savarkar’s friendlier language for Muslims coincides with such a turn
in the same period with his preceptor, Tilak. That is, it stemmed more
from political expediency than sincerity.

Ibid., p. 113, pp. 100–01. The reverse also applied in that seeing India
purely as one’s ‘holyland’ was not adequate—Chinese and Japanese
Buddhists, then, might claim Hinduness. India also had to be one’s
fatherland. See V.D. Savarkar, _Hindu Rashtra Darshan: A Collection_

Chandranath Basu—a Bengali conservative who used the term in
1892—also chose a theological explanation. Chaturvedi, _Hindutva_
_and Violence_ , p. 138. This was also different from an earlier,
nineteenth-century imagining of the term ‘Hindu’ by Bharatendu
Harishchandra (1850–85) in Benares as encompassing _everyone_
living in India, though this too was contingent on Muslims being
willing to accept the label. See Dalmia, _The Nationalization of Hindu_
_Traditions_ , p. 26.
Savarkar, _Majhi Janmathep_ , p. 225. We see these ideas repeated in
his foreword to Savitri Devi’s book _A Warning to the Hindus_
(Calcutta: Hindu Mission, 1939), p. vii, where Savarkar writes that
Hindus had been ‘fed on inertia-producing thoughts’ which left them
good for seeking spiritual release—an ‘escape from this world’—
without learning to actually live _in_ this world. This was one cause of
India’s ‘continuous enslavement’.
Or as he noted, internecine wars existed among the British, French,
Germans and even in America. ‘Are they still a people, a nation . . .?
If they do, the Hindus do.’ See Savarkar, _Hindutva_ , p. 95. And such
intra-Hindu disputes continue to this day. See, for example, a 2023
case around the Swaminarayan sect discussed in the previous chapter:

other Hindu outfits in Gujarat’, _The Hindu_ , 6 September 2023,

See also Savarkar, _Hindutva_ , p. 3, where he states that ‘Hindutva is
not a word but a history’, and p. 95. See also Savarkar, _Hindu_
_Rashtra Darshan_ , p. 16; and Bakhle, _Savarkar_ , p. 7, where she notes
that we see in Savarkar ‘no desire to return to the Vedas, or any
support for Hindu ritual’.
Christophe Jaffrelot, ‘Hindutva’, pp. 109–10 in Gita DharampalFrick, Monika Kirloskar-Steinbach, Rachel Dwyer and Jahnavi
Ohalkey eds., _Key Concepts in Modern Indian Studies_ (New York:
New York University Press, 2015), pp. 108–10. See also Basu,
_Hindutva as Political Monotheism_ , p. 5, where we read how Hindutva
seeks ‘a unifying ethnocultural consistency rather than a theological
unity’.
Of course, groundwork for this was also laid by wider debates in
Maharashtra, which created an intellectual environment open to
Savarkar’s Hindutva. See Sarwate, ‘Reimagining the Modern Hindu
Self’, p. 110. Nor does this mean he dismissed Hinduism. On the
contrary, he declared, ‘Hinduism and [political] independence were
interdependent.’ Quoted in Bakhle, _Savarkar_ , p. 83.
Or as Chaturvedi writes in _Hindutva and Violence_ , p. 25: ‘Savarkar
was clear that his purpose was never to produce academic
scholarship.’ One is also reminded here of Sheldon Pollock’s line:
‘We have always known that people make their stories from their
histories, and recently we have come to appreciate the degree to
which people make their histories from their stories.’ See Pollock,
‘Deep Orientalism’, p. 102.

Savarkar, _Hindutva_ , p. 8. See also Chaturvedi, _Hindutva and_
_Violence_ , p. 164. As Chaturvedi notes in ibid., p. 338, Savarkar
tended to accept Western interpretations of Indian history ‘when it
suits his objectives’ while dismissing all that was ‘critical of Hindu
history’.
Chaturvedi, _Hindutva and Violence_ , p. 168. Emphasis added. See also
ibid., p. 240.
Savarkar, _War of Independence_ , p. vii.
Much of Savarkar’s attitude appears already in older writings. See
Tarinicharan Chattopadhyay’s work, for example, in Chatterjee,
_Nation and Its Fragments_ , pp. 103–04. One is also reminded of
similar efforts in Bengal, using ‘strategic anachronisms’. See Monica
R. Bhagat-Kennedy, ‘Imagining Bharat’. Opposing views also
existed, of course. As P.N. Bose wrote in 1894, while there was
patriotism, Hindus ‘were patriotic more for the honour of their race
and their class than from a love of their countrymen generally’. See
Bose, _A History of Hindu Civilisation_ , Vol. 1, p. xvii.
Savarkar, _Hindutva_ , p. 18.
Ibid., p. 44. Hindu nationalists are also sometimes accused—and with
reason—of succumbing to James Mill’s notorious periodization of
Indian history into Hindu, Islamic and British periods, these
coinciding with the ancient, medieval and modern eras. However, in
the eighteenth century, before Mill, a Maratha writer took a
somewhat similar line when he declared how India had been ‘under
Hindu control since the days of the Mahabharata’. But when Hindu
kings ‘lost their old vigour’ and yielded to Muslims, the latter became
powerful, until unseated by Marathas centuries later. See G.S.
Sardesai, _The Main Currents of Maratha History_ (Bombay: Keshav
Bhikaji Dhavle, 1933), pp. 9–10. That is, there were the voices within
India who might have agreed with Mill’s categorizations.
Even in his journalism and speeches, he ‘frequently took facts . . . and
mixed them with fiction . . . only to assert a general historical
argument.’ See Bakhle, _Savarkar_ , p. 125, pp. 128–30, p. 134. See also

p. 295, where we read how Savarkar’s was ‘an overtly political,
polemical, and instrumental hijacking of history as memory work,
with a particularly idiosyncratic use of “fact”’.

As Bakhle notes, his books continue to be read ‘ _as_ histories’. See
Bakhle, _Savarkar_ , p. 20. The emotional appeal is explained also
because such feelings were not new. In the _Viswagunadarsana_ , p. 47,
for instance, while Maratha flaws are acknowledged, their conquests
are yet accepted as ‘bitter medicine’ for expelling Muslim power and
restoring Hindu deities. Similarly, in making the case for Indian
nationalism as a legitimate force, the statesman K.M. Panikkar also
described ‘the unity of India’ as the ‘very soul’ of Maratha power and
expansion. See Panikkar, _Indian Nationalism_ , p. 12. For at a broader
level, ‘struggles about stories of the past may also be struggles over
the proper shape of society in the present.’ See Bruce Lincoln,
_Discourse and the Construction of Society: Comparative Studies of_
_Myth, Ritual, and Classification_ (New York: Oxford University Press,
1989), p. 32.

bill that would have allowed inter-caste marriage. See Bakhle,

Savarkar as a living god. Savarkar’s tone here is reminiscent of the
Arya Samaj. As an 1897 editorial in the _Arya Patrika_ put it, ‘For our
Upadeshaks [preachers] to compete with Christians, they must give
up Chhut Chhat [untouchability] and caste restrictions.’ See Graham,
‘The Arya Samaj’, p. 473.
Quoted in Bakhle, _Savarkar_ , p. 157, p. 181.
Sampath, _Contested Legacy_ , p. 57. See also Parchure, _Tatyarao_
_Savarkar_ , pp. 24–26. Years later, B.R. Ambedkar, leader of the
‘depressed classes’ would observe that if Dalits went over to in Islam
or Christianity, this would ‘denationalize’ them; if they became Sikhs,
they would be out of Hinduism, but not ‘Hindu culture’. Quoted in
Keith Meadowcroft, ‘The All-Indian Hindu Mahasabha, Untouchable
Politics, and “denationalizing” conversions: the Moonje-Ambedkar
Pact’, p. 17, in _South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies_ 29, 1
(2006): 9–41.
Sampath, _Contested Legacy_ , p. 65, p. 74, and Parchure, _Tatyarao_
_Savarkar_ , p. 22, p. 28, pp. 30–31.
See Sarwate, ‘Reimagining the Modern Hindu Self’, pp. 100–10.
Quoted in Sampath, _Echoes_ , pp. 422–23. Indeed, where intellectuals
like Ambedkar saw ‘Hindu’ and ‘Brahmin’ as synonymous, Savarkar
went with the non-Brahmin idea that ‘one became a better Hindu if
one shed Brahminism’s useless ritualism and illogical beliefs.’ See
Bakhle, _Savarkar_ , p. 170. He also lampooned those who saw modern
science in ancient texts. ‘As soon as coal-fired trains get going, they
start hearing the sound of railway engines in the Vedas.’ Quoted in
ibid., p. 184.
Quoted in Chaturvedi, _Hindutva and Violence_ , p. 339.
Sampath, _Contested Legacy_ , p. 63, and Parchure, _Tatyarao Savarkar_ ,
p. 29.
This meant also, for example, that where Tilak not just venerated the
cow but urged others to view the ‘mother country [also as] a great
cow’, Savarkar approached the cow from a more utilitarian
perspective. See Wolpert, _Tilak and Gokhale_ , p. 279, and Sampath,

_Echoes_ , pp. 429–32. At one point, he even wrote, almost in a Phulelike tone, how the orthodox ‘filled their cupped palms with cow
urine’ but refused to accept even sacred Ganga water from the hands
of a Dalit. They worshipped the cow, but why not the pig given that
Vishnu had also taken an avatar as a boar? See Bakhle, _Savarkar_ , pp.

See Sampath, _Contested Legacy_ , p. 329. In a discussion with an
American diplomat, Savarkar, in the context of the Muslim demand
for a separate state (Pakistan) to be carved out of India, also asked
‘what would be the reaction of the average American if the negro
minority in the United States were to claim the right to establish an
independent State of Mississippi or Alabama’. See letter dated 9
February 1944 from the American Consul in Bombay to the Secretary
of State at

lay in upper India, through the 1920s, its leadership came to be
dominated by Tilakite Maharashtrians. In 1939, Savarkar’s younger
brother in a speech also identified three ‘enemies of Hinduism’: the
British, Congress and Muslims. See ‘Notes on the Rashtriya Swayam
Sewak Sangh’. The _rashtriya hijade_ (eunuchs) line is from Bakhle,

Ghose in _Tale of My Exile_ , pp. 66–67, 78, pp. 141–42 hints at
religious segregation, even if not with Savarkar’s bitterness. Muslims
and Sikhs were allowed to retain beards, for example, but Brahmins
were forced to surrender the sacred thread they wore.

He reiterates this point in colourful prose in _Six Glorious Epochs_ , p.

See also Savarkar, _Majhi Janmathep_ , p. 418, where Savarkar
triumphantly claims that if when he came to the Andamans, the
prison was under a ‘Pathan Raj’, thanks to his strikes and efforts to
unite Hindu prisoners, by the end the equation was no longer
lopsided. See also Parchure, _Tatyarao Savarkar_ , pp. 16–17.
In this respect, see also Shraddhananda Sanyasi, _Hindu Sanghatan:_
_Saviour of the Dying Race_ (1926).
On this, see also Kaviraj, _The Imaginary Institution of India_ , with its
discussion on ‘fuzzy’ communities and their transformation into
‘enumerated’ ones.

In 1910, thus, the then census commissioner wondered if these
sections of Hindus society should really be classed under that tag. It
sparked protests and claims that the British were seeking to
‘amputate’ the Hindu majority. See Bapu, _Hindu Mahasabha_ , p. 15.

Samajists like Lala Lajpat Rai had also made similar arguments. See,

See Pillai, _Ivory Throne_ , pp. 396–405. This Hindu character was also
used to prevent giving the state’s people representative government,
on the ground that non-Hindus would also be able to determine
political decisions. See Menon, _Triumph and Tragedy_ , p. 276. See
also Savarkar, _Hindu Rashtra Darshan_ , p. 71. And the Mahasabha
was quick to seek an alliance with Hindu princes, seeing in them a
source of both financial and moral sustenance for their cause. See

Exploring the Cartography of Hindu Nationalism in Colonial India’,

As one scholar puts it, Hindu and Muslim communal politics
emerged in an ‘interactive relation’. ‘Each side fed off the angers and
fears excited by the other.’ See Keith Meadowcroft, ‘The emergence,
crystallization and shattering of a right-wing alternative to Congress

nations living side by side in India’; that ‘there are two nations in the
main’ in the country. See Savarkar, _Hindu Rashtra Darshan_ , p. 26.
But as Chaturvedi observes, Savarkar’s admission of two nations did
not mean he was willing to concede two _states_ , as the League desired.
Instead, as one critic noted, his goal was a Hindu ‘empire over
Muslims’. See _Hindutva and Violence_ , p. 333.

mocking of Gandhian non-violence: it was an ‘immoral creed’ with a
‘queer belief in self-tortures’. See Savarkar’s statement dated 24 June
1941 in File No. 214, Home Dept (Political-I), 1941, NAI. Elsewhere

Bombay in File No. 222, Home Dept (Political-I), 1942, NAI.
It must be stated that several Congressmen also harboured similar
feelings. See, for instance, Madan Mohan Malaviya’s 1923 remarks
in Jaffrelot, _Hindu Nationalism_ , pp. 65–66.
In the 1920s also the Mahasabha had asserted that they were the right
body to negotiate with the League, given that they openly represented
Hindus, as opposed to the Congress. See Meadowcroft, ‘Hindu
Mahasabha’, p. 13.
Draft of Resolution for Hindu Mahasabha meeting dated 10 May
1942 in File No. 222, Home Dept (Political-I), 1942, NAI. Emphasis
added. This was a longstanding woe. Historically also, Savarkar
argued, that Hindus were always bending backwards to assuage
Muslim demands. See Bakhle, _Savarkar_ , p. 144.
See Intelligence Bureau report dated 26 August 1941 in File No. 243,
Home Dept (Political-I), 1941, NAI.
B.B. Gudi’s note. See also Secret Report dated 2 April 1942 in ibid.,
where also Savarkar states that the ‘integral unity of India as a whole
has been an accomplished fact of Hindu thought throughout the ages’.
The Mahasabha could never ‘be a party to proposals aiming at the
dismemberment of India’.
Savarkar, _Hindu Rashtra Darshan_ , p. 36.
In the 1945–46 central and provincial elections in India it was wiped
out. In 1940, Savarkar himself admonished south Indian Hindus for
not being particularly interested in the Mahasabha and its ideology.
‘As a Hindu you should feel the pain of Hindus anywhere.’ Just
because the south did not see polarized relations between Hindus and
Muslims, that should not prevent Hindu consolidation, he argued.
Quoted in Sampath _, Contested Legacy_ , p. 263.
Just as Tilak had subordinated addressing caste inequalities to Hindu
consolidation, Gandhi in 1930s highlighted ejecting the British as the
first goal, with Hindu–Muslim unity subordinated as something to
follow, not precede, this. See, for example, Raghavan, _Circles of_

reciprocated Savarkar’s interest in Nazism, by translating his book on
the 1857 rebellion into German in 1940. See Chaturvedi, _Hindutva_
_and Violence_ , pp. 23–24. Savarkar, meanwhile, even in his last book
wrote positively about Hitler. See _Six Glorious Epochs_ , p. 470.

Interestingly, in 1934 after a shooting in Bombay, Savarkar had
similarly distanced himself from the act by stating that the men
involved were ‘known to him’ only in that they attended some of his
‘anti-caste dinners’ but beyond that there was no overlap in ‘criminal
design[s]’. Quoted in Bakhle, _Savarkar_ , p. 80.

renounce Hinduism. Even if such events occurred elsewhere, there is
no evidence for their having occurred in Kerala.
Ibid., pp. 179–80. See also Bakhle, _Savarkar_ , p. 349, where we read
how Savarkar’s view of history required ‘the taking of sides’; p. 354

For a study of this selective appropriation and the historical and
philosophical questions involved, see Brian A. Hatcher, _Eclecticism_
_and Modern Hindu Discourse_ (Oxford: Oxford University Press,
1999).
See, for instance, Heinrich von Stietencron, ‘Religious
Configurations in Pre-Muslim India and the Modern Concept of
Hinduism’, in Dalmia and Stietencron eds., _Representing Hinduism,_
pp. 51–81.
One could, in fact, argue that it is this innate fluidity that allows
Hinduism to take new forms as needed. See also Pennington, _Was_
_Hinduism Invented?_ , pp. 5–6.
Alam, ‘Competition and Co-Existence’, p. 48.
See also Nicholson, _Unifying Hinduism_ , where the development of a
united Hindu religion is placed between the twelfth and sixteenth
centuries.
So just as there are Puranas which elevate Vishnu or Siva over one
another, there are other Puranas, such as the _Markandeyapurana_ , that
equate and reconcile them as forms of the same supreme being.
Savarkar was not wrong, in this sense, when he wrote: ‘Hindutva is
not a word but a history.’
On this, see also note 119 to Chapter 1, and note 124 to Chapter 7.
As early as 1347, we find the Vijayanagara rulers appropriate the
word ‘Hindu’ for themselves. See Pillai, _Rebel Sultans_ , p. 80. And in
the 1379 _Candayan_ , a Delhi sultan is praised ‘for treating Hindus and
Turks equally’. See Busch, ‘Unhitching the Oxcart’, pp. 436–37. In
the same period, that is, in different parts of India, we find expression
of the existence of two identities. See also Pollock, ‘Deep
Orientalism’, pp. 105–06.

And all religions, historically, have defined themselves against an
‘Other’. To define ‘us’, there is also a necessity to point to a ‘them’.
Within religions too—if Catholic–Protestant polemics are any
indication—self-definition in good measure derives not only from
identifying what one is but also what one is not.
See Truschke, ‘Hindu: A History’.
In parts of Kerala in the south too, the sarong-like _mundu_ is also worn
in different styles, with Hindus tucking it in on the right, and
Muslims on the left. I was first alerted to this custom by a temple
priest who, noting I had preferred the left side, asked why I was
wearing the mundu ‘Muslim style’.
Kruijtzer, _Xenophobia_ , p. 6, p. 269. The right side, in general, is
considered more honourable than the left, and under British rule, for
instance, we see their political agents in Indian courts often insisting
on sitting on the right of the throne rather than the left, where some
‘native’ rulers deliberately placed them.
See Pillai, _Rebel Sultans_ . And as late as the twentieth century, there
were in India people who styled themselves ‘Mohammedan Hindus’,
showing also how boundaries could be porous. See Basu, _Hindutva_
_as Political Monotheism_ , p. 97. See also Pandey, _Construction of_
_Communalism_ , pp. 83–84 for a reference to ‘Muslim Rajputs’.
See also Kruijtzer, _Xenophobia_ , p. 198, p. 247. See also Busch,
‘Unhitching the Oxcart’.
See Kabir (Linda Hess & Sukhdeo Singh trans.), _The Bijak of Kabir_
(New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), pp. 50–51, p. 69, p. 79.
Vidyapati, Eknath, etc. do much the same. For a courtly eighteenthcentury work that speaks of two different faiths, see Busch,
‘Unhitching the Oxcart’, p. 419, p. 434, where we read: ‘Hindus and
Turks have been considered two religions, constantly at odds. They
are like the gods and demons.’
As Basu writes, ‘The genesis of Hinduism was therefore not as far
back in time as Hindu nationalists would suggest, nor was it as recent
as the nineteenth century, as modernists would aver.’ See Basu,


-----

_Hindutva as Political Monotheism_ , p. 91. And as O’Hanlon and
Washbrook observe as a general point, ‘pre-colonial Indian culture
had its own, often very important, forms of cultural essentialization
and reification’; not everything was born of colonial dynamics and
Orientalism, for ‘Indian cultures had and have their own forms of
objectification and essentialism.’ See Rosalind O’Hanlon and David
Washbrooke, ‘Histories in Transition: Approaches to the Study of
Colonialism and Culture in India’, p. 121, p. 122, in _History_
_Workshop Journal_ 32, 1 (1991): 110–27. On Hinduness fortifying
itself into Hinduism: this has parallels with Savarkar’s statement that
‘Hinduism is only a derivative, a fraction, a part of Hindutva.’
We can find other examples too of Indians attempting to
systematically unite different strands of tradition, with little no
influence from the West. For instance, Tulsi Sahib Hathrasi (c. 1760–
1843) presented north Indian bhakti saints as part of one single
broader tradition. See Karina Schomer, ‘Introduction: The Sant
Tradition in Perspective’, p. 7, in Karine Schomer and W.H. McLeod,
_The Sants: Studies in a Devotional Tradition of India_ (Delhi: Motilal
Banarsidass, 1987), pp. 1–20. The impulse to unite existed in India,
that is, even before sustained interaction with the unitary religions of
the West.

230, in Margaret M. Mitchell and Frances M. Young eds., _The_

See David Brakke, ‘Self-differentiation among Christian groups: the
Gnostics and the opponents’, pp. 245–46 in ibid., pp. 245–60. Writing
about South Africa, Comaroff and Comaroff observe similarly how

Even as they are encompassed by the European
capitalist system . . . ‘natives’ of other worlds often seek
to seize its symbols, to question their authority and
integrity, and to reconstruct them in their own image.
Sometimes they do so in open defiance; sometimes

through strikingly imaginative acts of cultural
subversion and re-presentation; sometimes in silent,
sullen resistance.

it also formed its sense of self in contrast with other faiths and
groups: Jews, Graeco-Roman culture and Islam. Or as Lieu writes,
‘To speak of early Christian self-definition is to recognise that the
sense of self always implies differentiation from one or more
“others”.’ See Judith Lieu, ‘Self-definition vis-à-vis the Jewish
matrix’, p. 214 in Mitchell and Young eds., _The Cambridge History of_
_Christianity: Origins to Constantine_ , pp. 214–29.
Edward Terry quoted in Kruijtzer, _Xenophobia_ , pp. 59–60.
See ibid., pp. 68–69. Emphasis added. This is, of course, not to say
that Protestant–Catholic rivalries did not break out in India ever. We
know they did, as seen at the end of Chapter 1.
This is a general point worthy of notice: the fact that as much as the
colonial encounter modified the societies of those who were
colonized, it also altered the colonizer and his own society.
The preference for the Brahminical can, of course, be explained
partly by Brahmin dominance in the spheres of reform,
administration, nationalism and in those in dialogue with the colonial
state. But additionally, in a diverse country like India, historically
also—as we saw in the Introduction—the Brahminical offered
unifying elements. This served Hindu intellectuals well in the
intersection between religion, nationalism and the assertion of panIndian identity.
As Pandey writes, ‘“religion” is also not fixed for all time,
unchanging, unchangeable. Rather, new issues gain importance, new
questions become central, the “preservation of religion” acquires

different meanings in different social and political contexts.’ See
Pandey, _The Construction of Communalism_ , p. 83. All identity itself
is, to quote Judith Lieu, about ‘experienced continuity amidst the
constant change and decay’ that comes naturally with time. See Judith
M. Lieu, _Christian Identity in the Jewish and Graeco-Roman World_
(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 21–22.
They held the Mughal rank of _panch-hazari_ and, in the 1790s, the
rajah confirmed his ‘obedience’ to Delhi, even if this was largely
ceremonial. See letter dated 18 November 1795 from the Governor of
Bombay to Governor General in IOR/F/4/9/711, and B. Sobhanan,
_Rama Varma of Travancore: His Role in the Consolidation of British_
_Power in South India_ (Calicut: Sandhya Publications, 1977), pp. 14–
15. This fits into Bayly’s lowest rung of the Mughal order, with its
‘nominal allegiance’ to the emperor. See Bayly, _Indian Society_ , p. 23.
It was in 1813 that, when it was suggested that endorsement of his
title be obtained from the emperor, that the British vetoed it, stating
that it was to the British ‘alone [that] the support and protection of the
state of Travancore belonged’. See Governor of Madras to Court of
Directors, 4 February 1814, IOR/F/4/443/10660.
Menon, _History of Travancore_ , p. 267. The missionary who reports
that the rajah spoke English in the 1780s, of course, could not help
but add that despite all this and his ‘many good moral qualities’, he
‘cannot perceive the value of the Christian religion’. See ibid., p. 264.
That the rajah spoke English is also confirmed in the Governor of
Bombay’s letter dated 18 November 1875 cited above.
See Pillai, _False Allies_ , p. 36, and chapter one of the book more
broadly.
To recall Benedict Anderson, all communities and identities are

As did the idea that contemporary Brahmins were not quite as good
as the ideal. The sixteenth-century saint Eknath’s writings feature a
dialogue in which a Dalit mounts a critique of what Europeans might
call priestcraft. ‘They say that they are Brahmins, but they don’t
bathe, pray to the sun, or read the Vedas. They do harm with this
chanting, trying to kill and bind, to fascinate and subjugate.’ Quoted
in Christian Lee Novetzke, ‘The Brahmin double: the Brahminical
construction of anti-Brahminism and anti-caste sentiment in the
religious cultures of precolonial Maharashtra’, p. 241, in _South Asian_
_History and Culture_ 2, 2 (2011): 232–52.
See Günther-Dietz Sontheimer, ‘The Erosion of Folk Religion in
Modern India’, p. 396, in Dalmia and Stitencron eds., _Representing_
_Hinduism_ , pp. 389–98. To this might be added the pull of
Sanskritization among non-Brahmin leaders as well, who also, to
augment the status of their caste or group, frowned on popular
religion. Here too, then, we find a complex interplay of the modern
with the traditional.
Or as Pollock writes, ‘If there was a British “Brahmanizing
tendency,” then, it may largely have recapitulated a precolonial
Brahmanizing tendency on the part of medieval ruling elites.’ See
Pollock, ‘Deep Orientalism’, p. 101. We see Hindu rulers promoting
Brahminical ideas along with actual Brahmins in positions of
influence in Vijayanagara, Travancore, Mysore, among the Marathas,
etc. Of course, they encouraged this often for their own purposes of
statecraft and state-building, but the trend itself was not new.
Or as Basu poses the question, is Hinduism ‘a garb that modernity
throws over Brahminism’? See Basu, _Hindutva as Political_
_Monotheism_ , p. 92.
Cherian, _Merchants of Virtue_ , p. 4, p. 85.

Government of India, 1902), p. 113. Similar protests were made in
1891 and 1911 as well. In the Travancore census of 1891, the
Brahmin author of its report uses the term Hindus freely when
speaking of high-caste groups but throws it in inverted commas when
referring to ‘lower orders’. See Aiya, _Report on the Census of_

Dalits too saw themselves often as separate. In religious songs sung
by Chuhras in north India, thus, we find lines like: ‘The Hindu has his
temple, the Muslim his mosque, but I give to you this altar of mud.’
Here, Dalits themselves applied the term ‘Hindu’ exclusively to
upper-caste communities. Quoted in Lee, _Deceptive Majority_ , pp. 61–
62. See also ibid., pp. 33–34, p. 69.

For instance, when Mahars in the Konkan demanded that Brahmins
serve them as priests; to have Brahmins attend to their rites was
always a mark of higher, less ‘polluting’ status. See Fukazawa, _The_
_Medieval Deccan_ , p. 106.

Quoted in Pandey, _Construction of Communalism_ , p. 90. This is, of
course, not to forget that casteism did carry itself into Christianity as
well, and there were equally cases where conversion did _not_ lead to
dignity. The Dalit Christian leader Poyikayil Yohannan, for example,
moved from a Nasrani church to the two foreign missions only to find
them all saddled with caste biases. He eventually fathered his own
spiritual and social movement. See Mohan, _Modernity of Slavery_ ,
chapter four.

and socially they were separate. Or as he wrote:

If religion was a circumstance from which social union
was made the only permissible inference, then the fact
that the Italians, French, Germans and Slavs in Europe,
the Negroes and the Whites in the U.S.A and the Indian
Christians, Europeans, and Anglo-Indians in India do
not form a single community although they all profess
the same religion, is enough to negative such a
contention.

See Ambedkar, _What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the_
_Untouchables_ , pp. 185–86.

Lee, _Deceptive Majority_ , p. 92 refers to ever the murder of an Arya
Samaj activist at the hands of upper caste groups.
Swami Shraddhanad quoted in ibid., p. 95. See also ibid., p. 85, p.
103. See also Bauman, _Anti-Christian Violence_ , ‘Introduction’, for a
summarization of some of the problems involved in implicitly
assuming that Dalits were always considered Hindu.

‘lower forms’ of Hinduism. But the difference was that while ‘every
true-thinking Indian is now trying his best to shake himself free’, in
Europe, the Pope himself was ‘but a tool to be used by the influential
camarilla of priests’, unable to see the ‘anti-christian things’ and the
‘growth of paganism’ in his church. India and Hindus, that is, were
progressing; but here in the very seat of Christianity in Europe, there
was regression.

#### Acknowledgements

I have been thinking about the themes in this book for over a decade. I first
attempted a study of the modern Hindu identity as a twenty-one-year-old
postgraduate student. That dissertation earned me a flattering grade, but in
the years that have passed since, my comprehension of the subject has, as it
must, evolved. In some respects, it has shifted substantially. I cannot claim
that my store of knowledge is perfect even now—I don’t think anyone
would be bold enough to say this when it comes to Hinduism. But I have
made a sincere effort here to answer questions that have played on my
mind. There will be other ways to address the birth of modern Hinduism;
_Gods, Guns and Missionaries_ marks the path I have pursued. I hope it will
stand up to scrutiny. The book may not satisfy everyone—I am not sure it
has entirely satisfied me, for there is so much more to explore—and it has
its limitations. But hopefully it will inspire some thought and contribute to
ideas around Hinduism.

In writing this book, I have benefited from the kindness of many

scholars, friends and readers. The chapter featuring Serfoji of Tanjore owes
much to Indira Viswanathan Peterson, who sent me drafts of her
forthcoming biography of the rajah. Father Jomy Joy helped me
contextualize the Nasrani Christians of Kerala. Savita Damle kindly went
over my Marathi translations to confirm I had not misunderstood the
original texts. I must also thank Govind Krishnan V. and Rahul Sagar—in
Govind’s case, an offhand remark, and with Rahul, a tweet, helped me add
interesting details to the book. When I was unable to gain access to a rare
nineteenth-century text by Vishnubawa Brahmachari, Suresh Gokhale saved
the day with a scanned copy. I also thank Prof. Richard Fox Young and
Prof. Daniel Jeyaraj for pointing me to Ziegenbalg’s letters. In London,
Ranvijay Singh Hada made time to look up material for me. And Prof.
Christopher Pinney was very kind in sharing his collection of pictures of
Tilak and Savarkar for this book.

I am particularly thankful to friends who have contributed in various

ways to this book. Over the last two years, I have had the most enriching
exchanges with Vinay Varanasi on Hinduism, discussing ritual, theology,
history, custom and much else.
Prof. P. Vijayakumar patiently read through an early draft of this book in
2020. Later, Smitha Nandakishoran, Sharik Laliwala and Keerthik
Sasidharan went through all or parts of my manuscript, and I thank them for
the meticulous attention they devoted to the text. There is one more person I
must mention, but they do not wish to be named. Nonetheless, thanks, M,
for the granularity with which you read the book. If it weren’t for these
readers, this project could not have taken its final, publishable shape. At a
personal level, my friends Shrayana Bhattacharya and Uzair Siddici have
been part of the years-long process of finishing this book, boosting my
confidence when I was tired or frustrated, and generally just being there for
me in times of self-doubt.

This book would not have been possible without David Godwin, who

championed it from the start—thanks to Chiki Sarkar for playing
matchmaker and introducing us. My thanks also to Aparna Kumar, who

gave me very useful inputs as the book neared completion. My editors at
Penguin, Manasi Subramaniam in New Delhi, and Stuart Proffitt, with his
colleague Vartika Rastogi, in London, have been a pleasure to work with. I
am grateful also to Manali Das, who endured countless emails from me
during the copyediting process as I changed my mind on everything, from
image dimensions to font size, and to her colleague Yash Daiv. Thank you
to Devaki Khanna for proofreading the book. For the beautiful cover of this
book, I thank Ahlawat Gunjan. Thanks also to his colleagues Neeraj Nath
and Aakriti Khurana. And for my photograph on the jacket, I am obliged to
Ashish Sharma.

This is my fifth book, and in some respects, I am familiar now with the

routine. Yet, this has also been an unusually demanding, draining enterprise.
Most of the writing occurred alongside minor but constant irritations around
my health. I could not have finished the book were it not for my family. I
dedicate this book to my mother, Pushpa, who has been my strongest source
of assurance and common sense. But in equal measure, I owe thanks to my
sister Indrani, my brother-in-law Kurt (in whose beautiful home I wrote the
final parts of the book) and my cousin Biju G. It is my name on the cover,
but in different ways this is their production too.

It is nine years now since I published my first book. If I have lasted this

long, it is because there has been an audience for my work. In closing,
therefore, I thank my readers. For everything.
