## Three Secrets

The aim of this book is to change the way you see the world.
It is grounded in my personal journey, a long adventure that has physically

transformed me and endowed me with magical powers. But this journey is not
mine alone. It is a collective journey, one of the most ancient and powerful ever.
Begun at the dawn of time by a handful of human beings, it continues to this
very day to transform our civilization, language, and thought.

How many among us have felt mathematics live and grow within ourselves?

I don’t know. I just know that we are a tiny minority and that our story is as yet
misunderstood.

Mathematics has the reputation of being inaccessible. You have to be one of

the elite, to have received a special gift. The greatest mathematicians have
written that this isn’t so. What they accomplished, as we shall see, they claim to
have accomplished through ordinary human means, their curiosity and
imagination, their doubts and weaknesses.

No one wanted to believe them. Perhaps they didn’t know how to tell their

story in simple enough language. Or perhaps they underestimated the force of
the myth that they called into question, one of the last great human myths: the
myth of intelligence.

Mathematics shapes our world. It is an instrument of power and domination.

But for those who live it, math is above all an inner experience, a sensual and
spiritual quest.

This experience has little to do with what we’re taught in school. In certain

ways, it’s a form of clairvoyance, of psychic thought. In other ways, it’s a
resurgence of the mysterious phenomenon that in our childhood allows us to
learn how to speak.

Understanding math is to travel along a secret path that brings us back to the

mental plasticity we had as children. It’s to discover how to reactivate and


-----

domesticate that plasticity. It’s to choose to bring it back to life. This intellectual
path is surprisingly close to that which we take in our everyday lives. But its
entrance is hidden, concealed behind our habits, behind our fears and inhibitions.
I would like to help you find this path.

## There Has to Be Something Else

“I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.”
When I was fifteen, I hated this quote from Einstein. To me it sounded

phony, insincere, like a supermodel saying that what really counts is inner
beauty. Do we really need to hear this stuff?

The main message of this book, however, is to take Einstein’s words

seriously.

When you think about it, it is surprising that we have such a hard time taking

him seriously. Einstein doesn’t have the reputation of being a complete idiot or a
compulsive liar. If you ask people in the street, they’ll say that his theory of
relativity is one of the great contributions to human thought. What Einstein said
and wrote, therefore, merits our attention.

But when he suggests that his creativity might be accessible to others, that it

simply follows from a slightly different approach that anyone might take, we
find it hard to believe him. The poor old guy doesn’t know what he’s saying. Or
worse, it’s false modesty, and he’s saying it just to show off.

The problem is that once you refuse to take Einstein’s statement seriously,

you cut off the conversation—a conversation that deserves to be pursued.

Einstein’s statement is objectively intriguing but it doesn’t really say much.

Let’s assume that it is correct. What are we supposed to do with it? How can it
help us? Without any concrete details or practical advice, it’s difficult to learn
anything from it.

It’s kind of surprising that no one had the presence of mind to respond,

“Albert, what you just said is really interesting, but we’d like to know more.
Could you explain it to us? We want to know the secret details, to learn how you
really do it. Do you want to go get a coffee? Or maybe go for a nice walk in the
woods? Come on and tell it all; we have loads of questions!”

The first questions I would have liked to ask are pretty inane:

_1. Albert, where does your curiosity come from?_
I don’t know many people curious enough to shut themselves in a room and

meditate upon problems in theoretical physics. But I do know a few, and they all


-----

say the same thing: that if they shut themselves in a room and study problems in
theoretical physics, it’s of course in part scientific ambition, but mostly because
they get real pleasure from it.

So the question becomes: _Albert, how do you derive pleasure from studying_

_physic_ s?

_2. How do you keep from getting discouraged?_
To be _passionately_ curious means to have the ability to be interested in

things with an unwavering commitment, with an intensity and tenacity that never
fails. Einstein clearly found a secret means of not giving up where others had
faltered. What was his secret?

Doing research in pure mathematics has taught me one essential thing: that

when you shut yourself in a room with a difficult problem, you have only one
wish: to get out of there as fast as you can.

It’s simply terrifying to reach the limits of your intelligence, to push on in

vain, to struggle for months, to feel too stupid to understand and have no idea
how to pull through.

Einstein found a way to tame his fears and resist the impulse to flee. How did

he do it?

_3. When you’re alone in a room with a problem, what exactly is going on?_
Or, to be more explicit: what did Einstein do with the problem? How did he

get his hands on it? What was he playing around with?

It might seem silly to use such trivial language, but let’s be honest: what we

really want to know are the juicy details. We want to know what _really_ went on
inside Einstein’s head. We want to know how he actually did it. We want to
know Einstein’s technique, his secret magic that worked every time.

We know that intellectual creativity isn’t just a question of how much work

you do. We know there has to be something else, a secret ingredient, something
mysterious that’s never even mentioned at school.

If Einstein had taken the time to teach us his method for achieving great

scientific discoveries, his contribution to humanity would have greatly surpassed
his work in physics. As the saying goes, give someone a fish and they’re hungry
again tomorrow; teach them how to fish and they’ll have food for a lifetime.

But this discussion never took place. It never will take place. Albert Einstein

died on April 18, 1955, at the University Medical Center of Princeton. The
doctor who performed the autopsy was himself so eager to discover the secret of


-----

Einstein’s genius that, without the consent of the family, he removed the brain
and sliced it into thousands of pieces.

He didn’t learn much from it.

## The Method

This problem, however, goes far beyond Einstein. It’s gone on for centuries.

It concerns our false beliefs, our misconceptions about intelligence and
creativity, and the extent to which these false beliefs limit us.

The most difficult thing about understanding Einstein’s work is

mathematical formalism. It’s also what caused Einstein himself the greatest
trouble, as he admitted to a high school student who asked him for advice: “Do
not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still
greater.”

Four hundred years ago the greatest mathematician of the time talked about

his life in a book that has since become famous. His message is perfectly clear
from the outset. It can be summed up as follows: “I am not any more intelligent
than the others. I simply had the chance to discover a magical method that
allowed me to become better than anyone else. I will tell you how I did it.”

The same knee-jerk reaction that makes it difficult to take Einstein’s words

seriously also keeps us from understanding what this mathematician (René
Descartes) is trying to tell us, and keeps us from placing his book ( _Discourse on_
_Method_ ) where it belongs: in the self-improvement section.

The consensus is that there isn’t any method for becoming a great

mathematician, any more than there is for losing weight by drinking milkshakes
or getting rich by working from home for two hours a week.

Little does it matter that Descartes is telling us the exact opposite.

## Three False Beliefs

We’ll talk more about _Discourse on Method_ in chapter 14 , but in order to

understand what Einstein and Descartes are trying to tell us, we have to begin by
ridding ourselves of three common beliefs about mathematics:

1. In order to do mathematics, you need to think logically.
2. A few of us are naturally at ease with numbers and a few others naturally have

a good geometric intuition. Unfortunately, the great majority of people
understand nothing about math, and can’t do anything to change that.


-----

3. Great mathematicians are born with a brain fundamentally different from ours.

We may as well be clear about the first one: no, mathematicians don’t think

logically. It is in fact utterly impossible to think logically. Logic doesn’t help at
all with thinking. We shall see later on what it is used for.

The second fallacy is truly toxic. It has the power to make us hopelessly

inhibited. It has actually succeeded at convincing most of humanity that math is
a strange and dangerous territory. For each of us, including the most “gifted,” it
imposes an unsurpassable limit, that of the mathematical intuition everyone is
“naturally” endowed with.

The third misconception is a simple variation on the same theme: to be like

Einstein or Descartes, you have to be born that way; you can’t get there by
trying. And when Einstein or Descartes tell us differently, they’re just making
fun of us.

This vision that we’re incapable of _becoming_ good at math is false, but it

derives from an essential truth: the magic power of mathematicians isn’t logic
but intuition.

## Official Math vs. Secret Math

Einstein liked to talk about the importance of intuition in his discoveries. “I

believe in intuition and inspiration,” he said, and he was being quite serious
when he said it. As for mathematicians, they know quite well that there exist two
different kinds of math.

Official math can be found in textbooks, where it is presented in a logical

and structured manner, in an esoteric language that relies on indecipherable
symbols.

Secret math, also known as _mathematical intuition,_ can be found in the heads

of mathematicians. It consists of mental representations and abstract sensations,
often visual, that are for them quite obvious, and that give them a great deal of
pleasure. But when it comes to sharing these sensations with the rest of the
world, mathematicians are often at a loss. What had seemed so evident to them is
suddenly less so.

To transcribe their ideas, mathematicians have had to invent that esoteric

language and those indecipherable symbols, just as musicians had to invent a
complex musical notation in order to transcribe their compositions. Except that
musicians have one enormous practical advantage: they only have to have their
music played for everyone to immediately understand what it’s about, without


-----

needing to decipher the written score.

Mathematicians don’t have this option and it’s a huge problem for them. In

their minds, the ideas are luminous, simple, and powerful. On paper, they
become stunted and sad. The mathematicians’ curse is that they can only _play_
math in their own heads.

If you taught children music by giving them the written scores for Mozart or

Michael Jackson to decipher without their ever having heard it played, music
would be as universally hated as math.

Intuition is the soul of mathematics. Without intuition, math becomes

meaningless. But you mustn’t conclude from this that if you don’t understand
anything about math, then there’s nothing you can do to change that.

The mistake is in believing that our mathematical intuition is a static given,

an insurmountable limit. The intuition that we have of mathematical objects isn’t
innate. It’s not fixed. We can build it up, make it stronger day by day, as long as
we follow the right method.

Mathematicians are well aware that official math doesn’t tell all the story.

They know that the real goal is to _understand_ what’s in the books, to _see_ it, to
_feel_ it. What mathematicians do on a daily basis is to develop their intuition, to
make it richer, clearer, more powerful. Even more so than the publications and
official works, mathematicians’ intuition is their masterpiece, their lifetime
accomplishment.

This extraordinary art of seeing the unseen, of feeling what can’t be felt, of

understanding at the deepest level, to the point where it becomes self-evident,
what 99.9999 percent of humanity deems grotesquely abstract and utterly
unintelligible—this is mathematicians’ great art and their true secret. Only those
who have mastered this art know how far it can lead.

But how do they do it? That’s the subject of this book.

## Three Secrets of Mathematicians

1. _Doing math is a physical activity._ To become capable of understanding

what you don’t yet understand, you have to perform specific actions in your
head. These actions are invisible yet indispensable. They aim at expanding your
intuition and developing new, deeper, and more powerful mental representations.
In the short run this activity can be exhausting, but in the long run it makes you
incredibly stronger. Learning how to do math is learning how to make use of
your own body. It’s like learning how to walk, swim, dance, or ride a bike.
These unseen actions aren’t innate, but we all have the ability to learn them.


-----

2. _There’s a way to become good at math._ This method is never taught in

school. It doesn’t resemble any academic method and goes against the traditional
tenets of education. It tries to make things easier rather than more difficult. You
can compare it to meditation, yoga, rock climbing, or martial arts. It includes
techniques to overcome our fears, conquer our flight reflex in the face of the
unknown, and find pleasure in being contradicted. The method’s exact scope is
actually broader than math. It’s a universal method for reprogramming our
intuition and, in that sense, it’s a method for becoming more intelligent.

3. _The brains of great mathematicians work the same way as ours._ There’s

no doubt that natural aptitude in math, like natural aptitude in any other physical
activity, isn’t equally distributed among individuals. But these biological
differences play a far lesser role than most people assume.

The latter point is undoubtedly controversial. A striking aspect of

mathematics is the regular occurrence of incredibly talented individuals who
appear out of nowhere and, from a young age, demonstrate abilities vastly
superior to that of their peers. At the other end of the spectrum, many people
struggle with high school math or even primary school math. In the absence of a
better explanation, it is natural enough to attribute this extreme level of
inequality to “innate” talent.

But the competence gap that requires explaining is, in fact, too extreme for

genetics. Human beings do exhibit innate biological differences, but overall we
are a fairly homogeneous species. People differ in height, muscular strength,
cardiac output, and lung capacity, and part of this variability can be traced to
genetic factors. Yet those differences never encompass multiple orders of
magnitude.

To use a metaphor that we’ll develop in the next chapter, math is so unequal

that it’s as if some people could run the one-hundred-meter dash in under a
second, while the majority wouldn’t make it in a week. While it’s conceivable
that some people may genetically be endowed with a neuronal metabolism that is
more efficient and powerful, making them, let’s say, _twice_ as capable in math, or
why not _ten times_ as capable in math, it’s hard to believe that genes alone could
explain such an absurd level of inequality.

Here is a simpler and much more credible explanation. Developing good

mental habits, adopting the right psychological attitude, can make you _a billion_
_times_ better at math. But the method for becoming good at math has never been
taught in schools. You can reach it only by accident. You’re left to discover, by
yourself and by chance, snippets of the method. Most people end up not
discovering anything, because certain essential points of the method are


-----

surprising and counterintuitive. It’s very easy to overlook them.

The brains of great mathematicians work in the same way as ours. But their

personal history, the way in which they developed their own experience of the
world around them, gave them the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the
method from early childhood. They found their own way, without following a
set path and without knowing what they were doing, by dumb luck.

## An Oral Tradition

Mathematics is often defined as the study of numbers, shapes, and other

types of abstract structures. Alternatively, some define it through its formal
aspects: the symbols and formulas, the axioms and theorems, the systematic use
of logical deduction. But a few definitions are careful enough to add this curious
caveat: _no one really knows how to define mathematics._

For example, as I’m writing these lines, the Wikipedia page under

“Mathematics” states that “there is no general consensus among mathematicians
about a common definition for their academic discipline.”

A key message of this book, however, is that there is a latent consensus

among mathematicians about what it means to _do_ math and what it _feels_ like.
The entire book can be read as an attempt to document this unexpressed
consensus and “leak it” to the general public.

If this consensus were to be turned into a definition, it wouldn’t characterize

math in terms of what it studies, but as a human activity of a particular nature.
Meanwhile, mathematics remains the only academic discipline that is universally
taught without anyone having agreed on what it’s supposed to be, which leads to
some truly bizarre consequences.

For example, many mathematicians have spoken about their feeling of

having been self-taught. In light of the prominent role of math in the curriculum,
this is a startling paradox. Of course they’re not really self-taught, since they
learned a lot in school. But they are self-taught in the sense that the most
important things were not taught at school.

I’m one of these paradoxical autodidacts. I learned the basics of official math

at school. At the same time, without anyone teaching me, I discovered the
rudiments of secret math.

For a long time, I wasn’t aware of the relationship between the invisible

actions I was performing in my head and being good at math. It was simply a
habit I’d developed, a particular way of using my imagination.

I’ll talk later about the exercises in imagination that I began to do from


-----

childhood on. At first, it was nothing more than innocent games. For example, I
had fun walking around the room with my eyes closed while trying to remember
the layout of the furniture. What did this have to do with what I was learning at
school?

I wasn’t even particularly good. I often ran into the walls. I never imagined

that this game, and other increasingly difficult ones, would allow me to develop,
starting out at the same level as everyone else, a particularly powerful geometric
intuition.

This geometric intuition has been the secret weapon in my mathematical

career. I began to see things that no one else had seen, to solve problems that no
one else had been able to solve.

It was only much later, talking with other mathematicians and reading the

stories of famous mathematicians, that I found out my experience was not at all
unique.

While the official knowledge has been transcribed in textbooks, the secret art

of mathematicians has remained an oral tradition passed down from generation
to generation. It reveals what no one dares write down in books because it
doesn’t seem serious enough, because it’s not science, and because it resembles
self-improvement too much.

This story deserves to be told with simple and easily understandable

language, because it concerns all of us, whether you’re bad at math or a math
whiz, young or old, artistically or scientifically minded. It talks of our strengths
rather than our weaknesses, of our hidden talents and what we can accomplish.

Math is an inner adventure, secret and silent. But it’s a universal adventure, a

journey into the depths of human intelligence, consciousness, and language.

In private conversations between mathematicians, when there’s no one else

around to overhear them, they can finally talk about how they really see things.

Yes, math is scary. Yes, it can seem incomprehensible. Yes, it feels like

you’ll never understand it. And yet, there’s a way to get there.


-----

## The Right Side of the Spoon

My son Aram is one year old and he’s learning how to eat with a spoon.

And, truth be told, it’s a disaster. In two minutes flat he manages to get his food
all over the place—on the walls, in his hair, everywhere.

I try to help him. I half-fill his spoon and give it to him. But he grabs the

wrong end, the end with the food in it. I tell him he should grab the other end,
the handle, and I show him how to do it. But he always insists on grabbing the
end with the food. It makes sense, after all, because it’s the food that he wants.
Except that isn’t how it’s done.

Yet I’m not really worried about it. He’ll get there. Everyone ends up

understanding which end of the spoon to grab. I’ve never heard anyone say:
“Spoons aren’t really my thing. I’ve never seen the point. They really get on my
nerves, so I just don’t use ’em.”

Humans don’t have any problems with spoons. Nobody hates spoons.

Spoons don’t hate anyone. They’re among the first tools we encounter in our
lives; we use them every day and we use them forever. At first, they’re
mysterious and strange. Then they become familiar. Pretty soon, we’re using
them without thinking about it, like our own hands. And in a way, they’re not
that different from our own hands: our brain has internalized spoons, their uses
and possibilities. They’ve become extensions of our own bodies.

When you know how to eat with a spoon, it’s easy as pie. When you don’t,

it’s immensely hard. We’ve learned to use a spoon so well that we’ve forgotten
that we had to learn it. We’ve forgotten that, at first, it was far from easy.

The complexity of this action only become obvious once you watch a baby

trying to do it. It requires excellent hand-eye coordination. Simply grabbing the
spoon and holding it correctly takes a bit of work. Not to mention that the right
way to hold a spoon depends on what you’re eating with it.

It’s already been fifty years since we’ve landed on the moon, but we’re just


-----

beginning to learn how to program robots capable of eating baby food with a
spoon. And let’s not even talk about kiwi, which is a whole different ball game.

## The Serious Stuff

Spoons are only the beginning. Then the serious stuff starts. We learn how to

put on our shoes and take them off. We learn how to brush our teeth and cut our
fingernails. We learn how to ride a bike and roller-skate. We learn how to peel
onions and make coffee. We learn how to play video games and sew on a button.
We learn how to drive and decalcify the coffeemaker. Sometimes it’s a little
hard at first, but pretty soon we get the hang of it.

Like the spoon or the bicycle, our tools end up becoming extensions of our

selves. We use them without thinking. They transform us. They augment us.
They make us what we are. Without our tools, we really don’t amount to much.

Language is the most difficult thing of all to learn. It’s an incredibly long,

frighteningly difficult process. At eighteen months old, hardly anything we
babble is intelligible. And yet we keep on trying all day long.

It’s enough to get you down, but we never give it up. No one ever says:

“Language, that’s really not my thing. It just ain’t worth it. Frankly, it’s a pain.”

No parent ever says: “Jane’s just so cute with her pacifier that it breaks our

heart to make her do anything so hard. So we’ve decided not to speak to her.”

Language isn’t an option. It’s not just something for the upper class, the rich,

the geniuses. It’s for everyone.

If you really wanted to mark a date when we first became human, you could

pick the day when our ancestors decided to give language to everyone. Well
before organized religion or codified laws, we chose to follow this implicit rule:
“Thou shalt teach thy children language.”

## A Radical Success

More recently, in the past two hundred years or so, we made a new

fundamental decision: to teach everyone how to read and write. This decision is
so foundational that it’s become difficult to imagine what our world would look
like without it, if only a small minority of the population, as was the case before,
was able to read.

In ancient Egypt, with the use of hieroglyphics, the art of writing was akin to

magic. Scribes were a hereditary caste, passing down their secrets from
generation to generation. In medieval Europe, writing was a vocation. Young


-----

men became monks, shut themselves off from the world, and devoted their
existence to copying manuscripts.

What did the peasants think of all that? Did they believe that reading and

writing required a special talent, a particular form of intelligence that they didn’t
have? Did they find being excluded from written language unfair and
frustrating? Or did they simply tell themselves they didn’t have the time, money,
or desire, and that in any case there wasn’t anything for them to read?

Today, no one thinks that reading and writing require a special gift. And no

one believes it’s not of any use. With rare exceptions, all forms of government,
whatever their religious or ideological beliefs, make primary education an
absolute priority.

The radical project of global literacy has been a huge success. Illiteracy


-----

hasn’t disappeared, of course, but it’s become much more rare. In a few
generations, humanity was able to accomplish a global program of cognitive
transformation without equal in history.

## A Total Disaster

At the same time that the great campaign of global literacy was being

undertaken, another radical decision was made: teach everyone the basics of
math. Today, in elementary and high schools around the world, more than a
billion children study math.

And it’s a total disaster.
Hundreds of millions of children suffer in silence. They feel like they don’t

understand anything, and flip-flop between utter detachment (they see absolutely
nothing useful in studying math) and the humiliating sensation of simply not
being smart enough.

If you ask American teenagers what’s the most difficult subject, math ranks

at the top of the list, with 37 percent. It’s also, by far, the most hated. But if you
ask what’s their favorite subject, math is again in first place, with 23 percent. For
some students, it’s the easiest subject.

We’re all aware of this strange phenomenon. It’s part of the furniture, and

we’ve come to view it as normal. We find it normal that there are people who
love math and find it very easy, and others who hate it and find it
incomprehensible, with practically no one in between.

We find the situation so normal that attitudes toward math have become part

of our cultural stereotypes: the nerd with bad skin and glasses who loves it, the
cool girl fashionista who hates it, the rebellious high school dropout who
couldn’t care less about it.

These stereotypes are stupid and insulting. I know dropouts who have

become great mathematicians. A high school girl has the right to be pretty and
popular, and still love math. She also has the right to become a great
mathematician.

We’ve grown accustomed to it, but the situation isn’t at all normal. It’s really

rather strange. It shouldn’t have happened like that.

Just compare math learning with other basic types of learning. Would it be

normal for teens to think it was cool not to know how to read? To figure that
those who could read well, without having to sound out each letter, necessarily
are some kind of weirdos?

Would it be okay for half of a graduating high school class not to know how


-----

to eat with a spoon? Or tie their own shoelaces?

Solving high school math problems should be as easy as tying your

shoelaces, and if that’s not the case, then there’s something wrong with the way
we’re teaching math.

## Two Hypotheses

To explain why some people are good at math and others aren’t, two

hypotheses are usually floated.

The first is that it’s simply a question of motivation. People aren’t good at

math because they don’t like it, and they don’t like it because they don’t see how
it’s useful in their day-to-day lives. But do people really think that history, for
example, is useful in their everyday lives? That doesn’t make it any less
intelligible, and history classes don’t throw people into a state of panic. You’ve
never seen students start crying because they don’t understand what a war or a
revolution is.

In fact, students who aren’t good at math understand very well that it’s useful

for something, if only to succeed at school and get into a good university.
They’re not stupid. They know very well that being bad at math means they
won’t be able to go into any number of professions, including some of the most
prestigious and best paid. Maybe they don’t understand why math is so
important, but they know that it is. They feel excluded, which gives them an
excellent reason for hating it.

The second hypothesis is just plain mean. It supposes that there’s a

mysterious type of intelligence, _mathematical intelligence,_ that’s unequally
distributed amongst the population. This explanation is based on biology,
postulating that there’s some kind of math gene. Those who are good at math are
simply born that way, and the others are out of luck.

That this idea is so widespread is somewhat surprising in itself. We should

have learned by now to be wary of these kinds of ideas. There was a time when
people believed that certain races were naturally made for working in the fields,
while others were made for owning the plantation. More recently, it was said
that women were incapable of flying fighter jets. Today, these ideas have been
discredited.

If you’re still skeptical, you’ll see in the next chapter that you have all the

intellectual abilities necessary to be good at math.

Biological inequality between individuals does exist, but it’s nothing like the

examples above. It’s something more like this. Imagine you had a senior high


-----

school class run a hundred meters. The vast majority would be able to complete
the race. Some would need eleven seconds, others thirteen or eighteen. And
maybe it would take a few of them thirty seconds to run that far.

To explain these gaps, genetics is just one factor, alongside motivation,

nutrition, lifestyle, and how much training the runners did. We’re not all
genetically similar when it comes to running a track race. But for a hundredmeter race, these genetic factors typically account for only a couple of seconds at
most.

Now imagine a senior class running a hundred-meter race in which some

finish in one second, but after a week more than half haven’t even made it. This
is about the kind of gap that you see in math skills at the end of high school.

You go looking for the students who haven’t made it. Some are sitting at the

starting line. They tell you that the hundred-meter is the worst thing in the world.
They have no idea what use it could be in their everyday lives, and they think
that the gym coach is a sadist.

Would you seriously conclude that the explanation is genetic?
I want to convince you that the only possible explanation is that it’s all a

giant misunderstanding. People aren’t good at math because no one has taken the
time to give them clear instructions. No one has told them that math is a physical
activity. No one has told them that, in math, there aren’t things to learn, but
things to do.

They’re grabbing the wrong end of the spoon because no one has ever told

them that there was a right end to it.

The words spoken by the math teacher aren’t the kind of things we really

need to retain. They’re simply instructions and indicators for the unseen actions
that each of us has to do secretly inside our own head.

Studying math the same way that you study history or biology is useless.

You might as well take careful notes during a yoga class so that you don’t forget
anything. If you don’t practice any breathing exercises, it’s worth nothing at all.

## The Power of Thought

Imagine a circle, perfectly round, without any defect. Any old circle. Got it?
In real life, perfect circles don’t exist. When you draw a circle on paper,

there are always slight defects. Nothing is ever perfectly round—not bike tires,
not the sun, not ripples on the water.

But that certainly doesn’t stop you from understanding what I’m talking

about, or being able to imagine a perfect circle.

Not only can you imagine it, you can literally see it. You can move it around

in your mind. You can make it larger or smaller. You can do whatever you want
with it.

This ability to see things that don’t exist in real life, to feel that they’re there,

right in front of you, to move them around in your head as easily as if you could
touch them—this is one of your magic powers.

It’s the starting point on the road that will lead you to really understanding

mathematics.

## Our Incredible Capacity for Abstraction

A perfect circle is a mathematical abstraction. If circles seem like familiar

objects, it’s because you, like all other humans, have a natural capacity for
mathematical abstraction.

But your capacity for abstraction isn’t limited to math.
Whether you want to or not, you spend much of your time viewing the world

abstractly. It’s a physiological characteristic of your body. Your brain is a
machine for creating abstractions from your sensory inputs and mentally
manipulating them, just as your lungs are machines for extracting oxygen from
the air and transferring it to your blood.

How is it possible? That will be the subject of chapter 19 , where we’ll see


-----

how the structure of our brain _naturally_ allows us to create and manipulate
abstractions.

Until then, and even if you don’t fully understand how such a miracle is

possible, you have to admit that you’re able to visualize a circle.

## Our Incredible Capacity for Reason

Can a straight line intersect a circle at three points?
Take your time. It’s not a trap. Just try to decide for yourself. Try to imagine

all the ways a straight line can intersect a circle and see if there’s any way it can
do so at three points.

No, a straight line can’t intersect a circle at three points.
The answer seems obvious? That’s because, like all human beings, you have

an incredible capacity for reason. Not only are you capable of imagining abstract
objects like straight lines and circles, but you’re able to ask yourself abstract
questions about these objects and manipulate them in your head until you find
the answers.

The answer seems obvious to you, but what would you do if someone told

you they didn’t understand?

You’d probably want to start by saying “You can see that . . . ,” but that

won’t work. If a person doesn’t understand, it’s because they can’t see circles
and straight lines as clearly as you do. Explaining math is getting others to see
things they’ve never seen before.

The reasoning you used to find the answer is intuitive and visual. In your

head, it’s a kind of cartoon where the main characters are a circle and a straight
line. This type of reasoning is very effective but difficult to translate into words.
Words can never fully express all the subtleties you see in your head.

By studying math, you can learn how to translate your visual intuition into

rigorous proofs. It will never be a perfect translation. It takes a lot of words to
express a simple intuition. It all seems so clear in your head. But once you start
to write it down, it seems technical and complicated.

## Our Incredible Intuition

You’re the only person capable of seeing what’s in your head. Even if it’s

painful, it’s only by making the effort of rigorously translating your vision into
words and symbols that you can share it with others. And it’s also the only way
to make sure that your intuition is right.


-----

Because sometimes your intuition is wrong.
You know it’s true even though you don’t like being reminded of it. The

quickest way to get on someone’s nerves is to make fun of their physique, but
showing that their intuition is wrong is almost as good. In general, it provokes
one of two defense mechanisms: people either say to themselves that they’re
losers, develop an inferiority complex, and stop thinking, or they say they’re
right after all and all the others are idiots (and stop thinking).

There is, however, a third way. When someone told Einstein or Descartes

that their intuition was wrong, they didn’t get upset. They didn’t think they were
idiots. They also didn’t think that the others were the idiots. They reacted
differently. How? It’s one of the central themes that will reappear throughout
this book.

In school, when they teach you to be wary of your intuition, they make two

mistakes—two big mistakes that hold back your intellectual development.

The first is to exaggerate things. They get you all worked up over nothing.

Sure, your intuition is wrong every now and then, but not always. Often it’s
right. And you can make it so that it’s right more often. You can train it to see
more clearly and distinctly. Starting from the same point as you, mathematicians
construct a visionary intuition that is powerful and trustworthy. They get there
using simple methods, like those taught in this book.

The second mistake schools make is to talk at length about the limits of

intuition without ever reminding you of its strengths. The message that sticks
with you is that intuition is imperfect. And that’s an important message. But
schools forget to pass on an even more important message: **your intuition is**
**your strongest intellectual resource.** In a sense, it’s your _only_ intellectual
resource.

These aren’t just empty words. I’m not trying to flatter you to get on your

good side.

Behind all this is hidden a profound biological truth that we’ll talk more

about later. It’s also a very practical truth that you’ve experienced a million
times before. You know that learning things by heart, applying ready-made
methods, or following reasoning line by line isn’t really understanding. That’s
why you never have complete confidence in logical arguments and you’re much
more at ease with what you understand intuitively.

## The Gift of Imagination

You’ve known for a long time that your intuition is powerful. You wouldn’t


-----

dare say it out loud, but it’s really your intuition that you secretly rely on.

What you may not know is that behind all the great scientific revolutions and

all the most difficult mathematical theories there are always intuitions, and these
intuitions are always as simple as your own.

What allowed Einstein to come up with the theory of relativity was a mental

cartoon not much more complicated than the one that let you see a straight line
can’t intersect a circle at three points.

When Einstein said he believed in intuition, he wasn’t referring to a special

form of heaven-sent intuition radically different from our own. If he’d really
thought that, he wouldn’t have said, “I have no special talent.”

It’s a bit disconcerting, but you have to accept the facts. Einstein was talking

of everyday intuition, the kind that we all have, that which is often seen as
childish and that school teaches us to distrust. Einstein was simply speaking of
our ability to imagine things. It’s a gift that we’re all endowed with. You might
think it’s no big deal, but it’s really quite something, and no one gets anything
more than that.

If, like Einstein, you’d learned to use your simple and childish imagination to

become the greatest physicist of your time, you would have said, as he did, that
the great scientific discoveries are simply a matter of curiosity (and people
wouldn’t have taken you seriously).

And even if you haven’t invented the theory of relativity, you’ve already

done astounding things. You’ve been able to picture a circle in your head.
You’ve been able to move it around with your mind. You’ve been able to
visually prove to yourself that a straight line can’t intersect a circle at three
points.

And all that you’ve done by closing your eyes and staying still. You’ve been

able to do it, literally, by the power of thought.

To the extent of our knowledge, this biological prowess seems to be limited

to humans. If hippos also know how to do it, they’re hiding it well.

If you’ve been able to do these things, rest assured: you have the genetic

potential and the intellectual faculties to become very good at math. From the
biological perspective, that’s all that’s needed. The other ingredients aren’t
genetic, and they’re also at your disposal. It’s simply a matter of sincerity,
patience, desire, and courage.

## Creating Clear and Strong Images

The big ideas are always intuitive and always simple. They’re even


-----

ridiculously simple. We only ever really understand things that are obvious.
When it’s not obvious, it’s because we haven’t really understood.

This is a universal law of human cognition. It states that our science was

invented by humans and that humans are, at the deepest level, all made of the
same stuff.

The great discoveries are made by people who are simply trying to

understand. They just want to make things clear for themselves. When they don’t
understand, they don’t pretend they do. They continue to search for the right
path, the right mental images, the right way of seeing, until it becomes obvious
to them.

The good news is that with this method they can only discover things that are

obvious. And what was obvious to them could someday become obvious to you
as well. This is an excellent reason to try not to let yourself be intimidated.

That goes for all intellectual matters, but even more so for math.

Mathematical knowledge isn’t based on experimental data. It doesn’t require
amassing encyclopedic knowledge. In fact, it is entirely based on explicit proofs,
which means that every result can be broken down into a succession of obvious
deductions.

The paradox is that in order to get to the point where something becomes

obvious to you, you first have to construct mental representations that allow that
to happen. Once constructed, these mental images allow you to see it
immediately and without any effort. But it takes a lot of time and effort to
construct them.

Without realizing it, you’ve already constructed a good enough mental image

of what a circle is. To understand math, you simply have to reproduce what you
managed to do with circles with other objects, construct other mental images,
and then combine these mental images to create yet others.

No one is born with these images ready-made. No one is able to construct

them instantly. The process of constructing them takes more time than you’d
think. For everyone, it’s a matter of uncertainty, trial and error, false leads, and
starting over again. And it goes on for your entire life.

Whether you do math or not, your vision of the world and your mental

images are constantly evolving.

The oral tradition of mathematicians begins here. It’s not a question of

miraculous recipes for becoming superhuman, but of simple principles that
foster the construction of better mental images.

What’s at stake here is your ability to reclaim control of the way you

construct your own vision of the world.


-----

You know that to stay healthy you need to exercise, eat a lot of fruits and

vegetables, stay away from drugs, and get a good night’s sleep. But can you
name the few basic principles that will help you construct strong and clear
mental images?

This subject has never seriously been tackled. When everyone was trying to

make you believe that you have to think logically, no one helped you develop
your intuition.

You’ve made do without any method and under the false belief that your

intuition is sometimes right and sometimes wrong, but that in the end there’s
nothing you can do to make it better.

In this context, it’s a miracle that you’ve managed to learn anything at all.
And yet, as we’ll see in the next chapter, you’ve done quite well. You’ve

already managed to develop a solid mathematical intuition. You may think
you’re terrible at math, yet you’ve perfectly assimilated mathematical ideas that,
for 99 percent of human history, seemed reserved for geniuses.


-----

## Real Magic

Take a billion. Then take away one. How much is left?
You don’t really need to think. You can see the answer in your head:

999,999,999. The answer is actually easier to picture than it is to pronounce.

It seems obvious, and yet it wasn’t always like that. To someone living in

ancient Rome, for example, it wouldn’t have been obvious at all.

In classical Latin, the word _billion_ didn’t exist (neither did _million_ ). To

communicate the idea, the easiest thing would have been to call it the product of
“a thousand times a thousand times a thousand.” A Roman during the time of
Julius Caesar should have been able to understand that, even if it might have
given them a bit of a headache. But if you had told them that you were capable
of taking this number, subtracting one from it, and picture the answer
_immediately_ in your head, they wouldn’t have been able to follow.

They would have taken you for some kind of math whiz.
You’d be hard pressed to write 999,999,999 in roman numerals. If roman

numerals are the only numbering system you know, 999,999,999 is much more
than a big number you don’t run into every day. It’s a number that you can’t
even “look” at. It’s so terrifying that it makes your head spin. The idea that
someone could instantly “see” it clearly and without any effort is absurd.

But there’s nothing extreme about the ancient Romans. Their understanding

of numbers was really quite advanced. The traditional way of counting among
certain aboriginal Australian people is based on parts of the body. You count
from 1 to 5 on the fingers, then move up the arm: 6 is the wrist, 7 the forearm, 8
the elbow, 9 the biceps. When you get to 10 (the shoulder), you keep going up
the body—12 is the earlobe. Yet if each number needs a corresponding body
part, how do you get to a billion?

In the Amazon, Yanomami languages have an even more restricted numeral

system: there’s a word for “one” and another for “two,” but there’s no word for


-----

“three,” just a catchall word that basically means “a lot.”

For someone who sees the world in this way, discovering that there’s a clear

distinction between 25 and 26 that can be perceived in a split second must come
as something of a revelation, comparable to what math students experience when
they learn that there are many different sizes of infinity that can be precisely
described.

## A Complete Sham?

An inhabitant of ancient Rome would be able to grasp immediately the

difference between XXV and XXVI. But your agility with big numbers would
lead them to believe that you’re a math whiz. That idea makes you smile,
because you know for certain that you’re no math whiz.

But are you sure about that?
If you think a math whiz is some kind of mutant with supernatural powers, if

you think that they have some kind of computer in their head that lets them do
calculations super quickly using the same methods that you know, then you’re
wrong.

In the end, math whizzes are kind of like Santa Claus: they don’t really exist.

When you think you’ve seen Santa, it’s never really Santa, just someone dressed
up like him. When you think you’ve seen a magician, it’s never really a
magician, it’s always an _illusionist,_ someone who knows tricks that can create
the illusion that they have magical powers.

And when you think you see a math whiz, it’s never really a math whiz, it’s

always just someone who has a way of seeing numbers that turns calculations
that you find complex and scary into something easy and even obvious.

The truth is that we’re all basically bad at mental calculation, except when

we have an intuitive way of radically simplifying the calculation and “seeing”
the result.

The decimal system based on Hindu-Arabic numerals is a “trick” that lets us

see certain results as obvious. The main difference between a math whiz and you
is that their bag of tricks is bigger than yours and they’re more used to playing
with them.

## Real Understanding

The decimal system of writing numbers seems so obvious to you that you

can’t even remember learning it. It’s just like using a spoon. You use it without


-----

really thinking about it, like it’s an extension of your own body. When you see
999,999,999, you think you’re seeing the number directly, without realizing that
you’re seeing it with the help of a tool.

Decimal writing is a purely human invention. More than simply a system of

writing, it’s a door into a state of consciousness where whole numbers, however
big they may be, become concrete and precise objects. At the same time, the
infinitude of whole numbers becomes commonplace.

Something previously unimaginable suddenly becomes commonplace: this is

exactly the type of effect mathematics produces in your brain. It’s a marvelous
sensation, a great delight.

When you were a child, you were proud to be able to count to 10, then 20,

then 100. It gave you bragging rights at recess. In order to brag some more, you
would have wanted to know the biggest number.

To tell the truth, your awareness of numbers wasn’t that far off from those

people who can count to 2 or 5 and are firmly convinced that the next number,
the number _many,_ is the biggest number.

One day, you realized that no number was the biggest. Even if you might

have arrived at this conclusion some other way, decimal writing gave you a
shortcut. You know that every number is followed by another. You know how to
see the succession of numbers like a counter that turns, and you know that this
counter can turn indefinitely. There’s no limit, there’s no special number after
which the counter stops working.

Yet for 99 percent of human history, no one had been able to picture a

number counter turning in their head.

The number counter turning in your head is the collective work of great

mathematicians who, from prehistory until the Middle Ages, fashioned the
image of numbers that we share today.

This image isn’t natural. It wasn’t inscribed in your body the day you were

born. It’s partially arbitrary: we might have chosen another system for writing
numbers, and you would see them differently.

More than four thousand years ago the Babylonians invented a _sexagesimal_

system: they wrote their numbers in base 60 rather than base 10. Babylonian
mathematicians were the most advanced of their time. Your mental image of
hours, minutes, and seconds remains profoundly influenced by their vision of
numbers.

What is natural, however, is your capacity to assimilate abstract mathematics

and to really understand them, to modify your brain so that this math really
becomes part of you.


-----

You believe you can see the number 999,999,999. What you’re really doing

is deciphering a complex and abstract mathematical notation. You decipher it
instantly, fluently, without even realizing it. Whole numbers may not be your
mother tongue, but you’ve become bilingual.

Successful math becomes so intuitive that it no longer looks like math. If the

example seems stupid to you, it’s precisely because you understand it at the
deepest level.

## Real Magic Doesn’t Exist

At the start of their careers, young mathematicians often feel like imposters.
It’s a feeling I know well, and in my case it seemed entirely justified. The

results contained in my PhD thesis were so obvious that it was almost like a
trick. My theorems were always simple, and their proofs never contained any
real difficulties.

Everyone around me seemed to be better at math. They were working on

profound stuff that was way out of my league. They were writing papers that
were extremely difficult to read, with proofs that seemed incredibly complex and
technical. If I managed to understand a few of them, it’s only because they
happened to be easier than usual.

I wanted to know how to do real math, difficult math. But all that I was able

to learn was the easy math, the math for dummies.

It seems silly to say this, but it really took me years to realize it was only an

optical illusion. The horizon was shifting with me. It was always staying at my
level.

Real magic doesn’t exist. When you learn a magic trick, it ceases being

magical. That may be sad, but you’d better get used to it.

If you find that the math you do understand is too easy, it’s not because it’s

easy, it’s because you understand it.


-----

## Unseen Actions

A great mathematician is, for example, someone born into a culture where

people only know how to count to 5, and one day realizes that you can go further
than that.

No one invented the infinitude of numbers out of the blue. At first,

mathematical ideas are shifting and uncertain. You have the feeling that you
might be able to go to 6 or 7, but you aren’t able to articulate it because there are
no words for “six” or “seven.” You have the impression of being able to go even
further, but this impression is fleeting. You don’t completely believe it, you tell
yourself something can’t be right.

This is what happens when you run up against the limits of language.
In order to express what you feel, you have to invent new words, or create a

new usage for words that already exist. Fleeting impressions cease being fleeting
only after you find a way to pin them down with words. It takes time to get
there. Words don’t come easily, and they don’t come right away.

The initial phase of a discovery is a spiritual experience. You think outside

of language. The world is illuminated. You have epiphanies. You see things that
until then were hidden. Things so new they don’t yet have a name.

You know what I’m talking about. You’ve already experienced this

marvelous feeling. Try to recall your first time. It was the day of your first great
mathematical discovery.

When you were a baby, long before you could speak, you probably played

with a shape-sorting toy.


-----

Your parents showed you how to do it. They took a block and put it in a

hole. You wanted to copy them. You took a block and tried to put it in a hole.
But it didn’t go. You pushed with all your strength but it didn’t budge.

That got you annoyed. Your parents told you that you couldn’t force it in,

that you had to look carefully at the shapes and match them: the round block in
the round hole, the square block in the square hole. See, it’s easy, right?

Except that you didn’t understand what they were saying. You didn’t really

have any chance of understanding. The words _round_ and _square_ meant nothing
to you. It wasn’t just the vocabulary that you lacked, it was worse: you lacked
the shapes themselves. You didn’t know how to see them. Circles and squares
were invisible to you.

All that you could see was that your parents were able to put the blocks in

the holes and you weren’t. And yet you were following their actions exactly. For
them, these actions worked, for you, they didn’t.

The scene was repeated dozens of times. Months went by; it was the greatest

frustration of your young life. Your parents were magicians, not you. It was
unfair and cruel. It made you mad.

But you didn’t stop trying. You went back hundreds of times to this mystery

that was so humiliating. Forget about the humiliation, you wanted to understand.
You wanted in on the secret.

And then one bright day, you understood. You took a block in your hand and

you noticed that this block had something particular about it, and that one of the


-----

holes had the same particular thing in common with the block. And it was into
this hole that you had to place the block.

This realization didn’t take any effort. You were just in the middle of going

through the usual motions, the motions that even yesterday didn’t seem to work.
And then all of a sudden the answer seemed obvious. It was like your eyes were
suddenly opened.

This was the period of your life when you invented the idea of shapes. It

wasn’t only about that block and that hole. It was about all blocks and all holes.
Each block had its corresponding hole, and they shared this immaterial thing that
didn’t have a name. It worked every time. It was the secret of the magic trick.

You invented the idea of shapes by yourself and for yourself. It wasn’t a

preexisting knowledge, outside of you, that language brought to you. You
learned all by yourself to see the shapes because, before you could see them, no
one could explain to you what they were. You later learned the words for the
shapes, but only after your perception of them.

From this point forward, you couldn’t stop yourself from seeing them. It

became ridiculously easy. Circles and squares, triangles and stars, hearts. It’s
actually a bit too easy for you. You’ve become incapable of imagining what it
was like _not_ to see them.

## A Love Story

Let’s set the record straight.
When you’d understood the secret of fitting the blocks into the holes, you

were happy. You were immensely proud of yourself. You had a big smile.

Your parents were also proud and happy for you. They’d given you the toy,

after all, to make you happy.

Maybe your parents didn’t know it, but they really loved math. In giving you

this toy, they wanted to pass along their love of math. And they succeeded. If
you have kids, you’ll also want to give them this toy.

Before school came along and got all caught up with it, before our

inhibitions and our fear of being judged came along, we all have experienced
great joy in math. Between humans and mathematics, it’s been a long and
profound love story.

Your beginnings were promising. Your discovery of shapes was really a

great mathematical discovery. I’m being serious. That’s not a metaphor.

Okay, it was a great discovery that was entirely pointless from a scientific

perspective. You’d just rediscovered something everyone else was already aware


-----

of. But from the point of view of your personal knowledge, it was spectacular.

What you felt that day was exactly what mathematicians feel when they

make a discovery. A mathematical discovery is just as simple, profound, and
obvious.

Before Descartes, no one knew that you could describe geometric figures

using equations. In _Geometry,_ his 1637 treatise, an appendix to _Discourse on_
_Method,_ he established a bridge between algebra and geometry, two branches of
mathematics that had previously been thought of as entirely separate. These
discoveries were the origin of the modern idea of _cartesian coordinates,_
something that’s since become obvious for any schoolkid: you can identify a
point in a plane by providing its _x_ and _y_ coordinates. It’s hard to imagine that
before Descartes no one had “seen” cartesian coordinates. It’s almost absurd,
like imagining people couldn’t see circles and squares.

Understanding a mathematical notion is learning to see things that you could

not see before. It’s learning to find them obvious. It’s raising your state of
consciousness.

When you look at the world, you can’t help but recognize shapes, size,

textures, colors. But there are many other things you might see. There are other
structures, other types of shapes, other types of relations between objects. Even
if you might not be able to see them now, these shapes and structures could
eventually become obvious to you.

They’re not that far away.
They’re not that difficult to see.
They are _literally_ right before your eyes.

## Billie and Her Friends

Fitting the right blocks into the right holes isn’t any harder than eating with a

spoon. But _learning_ how to fit the right blocks into the right holes is a whole lot
harder than learning how to eat with a spoon.

In the case of the spoon, you can learn by imitation. With the game of blocks

and holes, you tried to learn by imitation, but that didn’t work. You were
missing the critical step. Recognizing the shape of the block and identifying the
right hole were unseen actions that your parents were mentally performing and
that you weren’t in a position to directly imitate.

You have to keep in mind that most of the things we learn, we learn through

imitation. The instinct for imitation is universal. We share it with all other
mammals, and not only them.


-----

My favorite story of learning through imitation is that of Billie and her

friends. Billie was a female dolphin who lived in the Port River, Adelaide,
Australia. When she was young, Billie got lost. Isolated from her group, trapped
in a lock and worn out, she was rescued and placed in a dolphinarium until she
recovered her health.

There were captive dolphins in the dolphinarium that humans had trained to

perform acrobatic tricks. Billie saw them and spontaneously began to imitate
them.

Her favorite trick was the tail walk. That’s when a dolphin swims fast

underwater, on its back, then suddenly leaps straight out of the water. With the
leap, the dolphin looks like it’s walking backwards on its tail—thus the name tail
walking. It’s a very difficult maneuver, physically intense, with no other
function than pleasing humans or showing off in front of the other dolphins.


-----

Three weeks later, when Billie was released back into her native habitat, she

continued to tail walk. This trick had never been observed before in a wild
dolphin. But the most interesting thing was what happened next: the other
females in Billie’s group started to do the same thing. Tail walking became all
the rage among the dolphins of Adelaide.

In this way, we’re exactly like the dolphins: not only are we able to learn by

watching others, but what is more, we have an urge to imitate them. Our instinct
pushes us to copy one another.

It’s through imitation that we learn how to tie our shoes, use a toaster, ride a

bike. We may not get it right on the first try, but watching others do it gives us
an idea how. We know more or less what a shoelace or toaster or bike is for, and
we know more or less how to use them.

But math, because it relies on unseen actions, can’t be learned through

imitation.

## The Fosbury Flop

To make a mathematical discovery, you have to start by inventing for

yourself new mental actions, creating new images in your head, without
knowing in advance how to do it or whether it will work.

Inventing a truly new action is so rare in life that it’s difficult to find well-

documented historical examples. Even Michael Jackson didn’t invent the
moonwalk. He learned it by imitation. The origin of the dance moves goes back
at least to the 1930s, and to this day its inventor remains an anonymous genius.

Dick Fosbury was someone who invented a new action: the high-jump

technique that bears his name.

Before Fosbury, the two main techniques were the scissor jump (on the back,

legs first) and the straddle jump (on the stomach, shoulders first).

The Fosbury flop, on the back and shoulders first, might seem

counterintuitive. Taken out of context, with no cushion, it seems suicidal. Our
body doesn’t want to do that. Jumping backwards headfirst requires getting over
our instinct that tells us that, clearly, this move is too dangerous to be attempted.

Fosbury didn’t copy this movement from anyone else. He began to imagine

it in 1963, when he was sixteen years old, and spent years perfecting it.

Fosbury would have been happy to copy someone else. He wasn’t vain. He

wasn’t looking to be original or creative. He knew that imitation was the best
way to learn, and naturally first tried to high jump like everyone else.

His starting point was in high school, where he was the worst member of the

team. Because he wasn’t successful with the official techniques, he began
experimenting, looking for a more intelligent and efficient way of jumping: “It
was not that I was trying to win, but I was trying to not lose.”

The strength of his technique was that it allowed him to cross over the bar by

rolling around it while his center of gravity remained under it: each part of the
body successively passed over the bar but on average the body stayed below it.


-----

With the same thrust you can jump over a much higher bar.

Fosbury understood these scientific aspects. At university, he majored in

civil engineering. But he discovered his method through introspection rather
than calculation. He paid close attention to what his body was telling him,
concentrating on the movements that would allow him to more easily cross the
bar. Fosbury’s approach was both deliberate and meditative.

One day, by modifying his run and the position of his body, he broke his

personal best by six inches. It was his first real success in a school competition.
It was then that he knew he was on to something. But his coaches didn’t believe
him. For years, they continued to try to convince him to jump the “right” way.
Fosbury himself didn’t really have any counterarguments for them. He just said
that maybe his technique wasn’t right, but it was right _for him._

Thanks to his technique, Fosbury won the gold medal at the Mexico

Olympics in 1968. He was twenty-one years old. His first interviews show that
he himself didn’t entirely understand the depth of his achievement: “I think quite
a few kids will begin trying it my way now. I don’t guarantee results, and I don’t
recommend my style to anyone.”

But everyone copied him. From the next Olympics, in 1972, and onward, his

technique became the norm. For more than forty years, every time a new record
is set in the high jump, it’s thanks to Fosbury’s flop.

## Blindly Copying

The most striking elements of Fosbury’s approach will reappear throughout

this book, as we tell the story of how mathematicians actually work.

A discovery always begins with the simple and innocent desire to

understand. You invent new actions not because you want to do something new
and original, but because you can’t get where you want to be with the existing
techniques. Without any reference point, without someone to guide you, you
have to listen to what your body is telling you. You have to get used to feeling
your body in a new way. Finding the solution means thinking what had been
unthinkable. It’s like augmenting the cognitive capacity of human beings.

A particularity about mathematics is that understanding a discovery is almost

as challenging as making the discovery itself. In order to reproduce unseen
actions, you can’t avoid introspection. You have to listen to yourself, and
reinvent the actions _within yourself_ and _for yourself._

To illustrate this, imagine an invisible version of the high jump that’s done

without an audience or cameras, in an empty room, with the competition judged


-----

by electronic equipment that verifies the bar was crossed without recording the
jumper’s technique.

How would Fosbury have been able to tell his story?
Everyone would have been convinced that he was genetically programmed to

jump higher than anyone else. No one would have believed him if he’d said, “I
have no special talent. I am only passionately curious,” or “It was not that I was
trying to win, but I was trying to not lose.”

He might have written a book describing his technique and how it felt to

him. But how to find the right words?

The first time one of his jumps was filmed, Fosbury said he was surprised

himself, finding it hard to believe that what he saw on the screen was physically
possible and really corresponded to what he’d done. For someone who’s never
seen it done, learning to jump like Fosbury is almost as hard as inventing it
yourself. Even with detailed written instructions, it’s not easy. “Jump up in the
air on your back, headfirst.” Seriously? And why all these preliminary pages
about the trajectory of the run-up and the twisting of the body axis at the
approach to the bar? Why all this technical language? Is it really necessary?

To truly learn a movement, you have to understand it beyond words. You

have to feel it within your own body, and find it natural and intuitive.

## Unseen Actions

Math is mysterious and difficult because you can’t see how others are doing

it. You can see what they’re writing on the blackboard or on a sheet of paper, but
you can’t see the prior actions they performed in their heads that enabled them to
think and write those things.

Math itself is simple but the mental actions that allow us to make sense of it

are subtle and counterintuitive. These actions are invisible. We can’t simply
imitate what others do. We lack the adequate words to explain how to do it, and
in any case words will always miss the main point: what we really feel inside
ourselves.

All students must re-create the actions for themselves, blindly.
It’s all too easy to make fun of math teachers, but try putting yourself in their

place. How would you explain to someone how to tie their shoes if that person
had never even seen shoes and your only means of communication was by
phone? Take a few seconds to imagine the scene and you’ll see how hard it
would be. The very idea is so difficult it makes your mind reel.

This is the practical reality of teaching math, and we’re all in the same boat.


-----

Professional mathematicians have this in common with people who are bad at
math: they both know what it feels like to be totally at sea.

This feeling is part of their everyday life. Mathematicians at research

conferences know that things will probably fall apart in the first five minutes.
They know that it won’t do any good to continue on, that it will just be sad and
humiliating, because the words will simply have no meaning.

But they know that getting lost is a normal stage in the understanding

process. They won’t get upset. They won’t pretend to understand what they can’t
understand. They won’t even try to take notes. They’ll simply stop listening.

If they really want to understand, they’ll find another way.


-----

## Refusing to Read

I’m not a collector. I don’t derive pleasure from accumulating stuff. That

also goes for books, and a number of times in my life I’ve gotten rid of a big part
of my library, giving away or selling most of my books. I kept only those I was
especially attached to.

My math library is rather limited: fewer than one hundred books. Not many

people have a hundred math books, but some mathematicians have a lot more.
I’ve accumulated these books throughout my studies and career. Some of them I
was given because I knew the author. Fewer than a hundred, after all these years,
isn’t all that much.

Most of the books I’ve needed, I’ve either borrowed or read the electronic

version. I’ve bought only those that I’ve really liked, that I’ve really wanted to
own, or that I found especially beautiful.

One of my favorite books, one of the few that it would break my heart to

give away, is _Categories for the Working Mathematician_ by Saunders Mac Lane.

Every time I come across it, I smile to myself. This book, first published in

1971, remains a reference in category theory, the revolutionary way of seeing
and thinking about mathematical structures that Mac Lane and Samuel Eilenberg
invented in the 1940s.

I bought it twenty years ago, just after I’d finished my PhD, with my first

paycheck as an assistant professor at Yale University. There are few books that
have touched me so deeply. I find it splendid, luminous, inspiring, and
remarkably well written.

And I’ve never read it.

## Raphael

When I started working on my PhD, even though I was officially one of


-----

those who is _very good at math,_ even though my job already was to produce new
math, I felt overwhelmed by the existing knowledge.

Every time I opened a research article, I got stuck on the first few lines. I was

missing the basics. I looked for them in the references cited in the first article,
but these references weren’t any easier to read. So I searched in the references to
the references.

The references, the references to the references, the references to the

references to the references: it never ends. Even going back to the math from the
1950s, I found out that it was already incomprehensible to me.

Here I was, decades later, buried under thousands of books and tens of

thousands of articles, none of which I understood. How could I hope to invent
something original?

One day, I heard about a recent book on a subject that was useful—but not

central—to my research. Everyone was saying that this book was very clear and
well written. Which made me want to read it.

After a week, I hadn’t even made it to the third page. Demoralized, I went to

ask the help of my friend Raphael Rouquier, a young math prodigy I shared an
office with.

His reaction remains engraved in my memory: “Come on, David! Didn’t

anyone ever tell you that you should never read math books? Didn’t they tell you
they’re impossible to read?”

## Daring Not to Read

No. No one ever had the guts to tell me so clearly.
Raphael was exaggerating: it is possible to read math books. But it’s not

natural and it requires a tremendous effort, even if you’re very good at math.
Reading a math book (and not just a book _about_ math, like the one you’re
holding) is almost as difficult as writing one.

There’s a good reason for that. When you open a math book, you’re opening

a book where the most important words have a meaning that you can’t yet
understand. This meaning might be specific to this very book. To be in a position
to read it, you first need to find a way to make sense of these words. This
requires constructing for yourself the right mental images for each word and
each group of words, which comes at a heavy price. The effort will be almost as
intense as that which allowed the author to write the book, and it will lead you to
understand the matter almost as well as the author does.

If you really want to, if you have enough time for it and you’ve chosen the


-----

right book, it’s well worth the effort. Get ready for a few months of hard work.
This initiation rite will transform you. In my lifetime I’ve really succeeded in
reading only three or four math books. I don’t regret the time and effort. It gave
me unexpected powers, as if I’d drunk a magic potion. This power remains with
me today. But the potion was hard to swallow.

Even if Raphael exaggerated a bit, he was essentially right. Math books

aren’t made to be read.

Raphael was the first person I met who had never been afraid of math. It was

no problem for him to take a five-hundred-page book on a subject he knew
nothing about and open it right in the middle.

Even his way of holding books was different from mine. He didn’t put his

hands in the same place. Raphael balanced books on his forearm and held the top
of the binding with the fingers of one hand, which left the other hand free to turn
the pages very quickly. His technique was simple enough. He never started at the
beginning, but wherever he felt like. It wasn’t a reading technique as much as a
nonreading technique.

When you pick up a math book, you always have an idea in mind. Maybe

you want to understand an idea you’ve run into somewhere, to know if a certain
statement is correct or not, or to get an idea of how to prove it. What really
interests you might be Definition 7.4 on page 138, Theorem 11.5 on page 227, or
maybe just a particular passage in its proof.

What Raphael taught me to do was to go directly to page 138 or 227 and find

the four or five lines that at the moment interested me the most, _without having_
_the least scruple_ for skipping the mountain of preliminary material these few
lines supposedly depend upon.

That’s what’s the most troubling. A math book is supposed to be organized

logically, and to understand page 138 or 227, you _theoretically_ need to have
understood all that preceded it. Linear reading should therefore be the only
possible way of reading. But _in practice_ it’s next to impossible.

In the four or five lines that interest you, there might be a few words that you

don’t understand. If that stops you from understanding the rest, you’ll want to go
back to the definitions. That’s okay. Or you’ll manage to muddle through
anyway. That’s okay too.

In fact, you should do whatever you feel like doing. You can leaf through the

book for ten seconds, one hour, or three months—whatever. The underlying
principle is never to force yourself to follow the pages in order, but to follow
your own desire and curiosity.

The book should be at our service, rather than the reverse. It will never work


-----

if we try to read a math book like a “normal” book, if we let the book dictate the
pace, if we wait for it to take us by the hand and tell us a story. We’re not there
to listen passively. We don’t have the patience—and, frankly, we’re just not
interested.

We’re there because we have specific questions, because there are specific

things we don’t yet understand and that we want to understand. At any rate the
book should never dictate the agenda. We’re the ones asking the questions.

Let’s face the facts. The four or five lines that interest us will be hard to

understand, especially if they’re in the middle of the book. It might take us
hours. But every single page of a math book is equally hard. The so-called
“easy” (but boring) preliminary pages are no less hard to understand.

In the end, the page that interests us the most may end up being the least

difficult _for us._ First of all because we’re interested in it: interesting things are a
whole lot easier. And also because it’s necessarily tied to something we already
understand—otherwise it wouldn’t interest us.

Following your desire is the only way of giving the book a real chance. If

you start at the beginning, you run the risk of getting discouraged by page 2.

## Bill Thurston

It’s not only math books. There are other books that no one ever reads. Have

you ever read the user manual for your toaster?

Probably not. You’ve probably glanced at it when you unpacked your

toaster, but most likely you never opened it. Except, of course, if you had a
problem with the toaster, in which case you skipped the beginning and went
straight to the page you needed at that precise moment.

Comparing math books to a toaster manual may seem like a joke, but it’s

really a profound idea. And we owe it to Bill Thurston.

Bill Thurston, who was born in 1946 and died in 2012, is one of the most

fascinating mathematicians of the recent era. His work in geometry, of
exceptional depth and originality, constitutes a major step toward the proof of
the famous Poincaré conjecture, achieved by Grigori Perelman in 2003. This
work earned him the Fields Medal in 1982. Along with the Abel Prize, the Fields
Medal is the most prestigious award in mathematics.

Thurston is among the greatest geometers of the twentieth century, but that’s

not all. It’s not easy to sum up in a few words his mind-opening thought, his
unique brilliance, his unlimited curiosity. To my knowledge, no other top-flight
mathematician has collaborated with Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake on


-----

the creation of an haute couture collection.

In 1994 Thurston published a twenty-page piece in the _Bulletin of the_

_American Mathematical Society_ that described his motivation as a
mathematician and the mental processes at play in his work. Thurston notably
said how, when he reads a research article in a field he’s familiar with, he
doesn’t really read it. He prefers to concentrate on “the thoughts between the
lines.” Once he has a clear idea, the formalism and all the technical details
suddenly seem useless and superfluous: “When the idea is clear, the formal setup
is usually unnecessary and redundant—I often feel that I could write it out
myself more easily than figuring out what the authors actually wrote.”

“It’s like a new toaster that comes with a 16-page manual,” he continued. “If

you already understand toasters and if the toaster looks like previous toasters
you’ve encountered, you might just plug it in and see if it works, rather than first
reading all the details in the manual.”

The metaphor merits being stretched a bit. Thurston said that the manual is

useless if you already know what a toaster is. But what if you’ve never seen a
toaster before? Would the manual really be of any use?

You’d certainly be glad to learn that you shouldn’t put your fingers inside it,

and that you should never use it in the shower. But the blaring warnings that
you’re urged to READ CAREFULLY BEFORE USING aren’t going to help you solve the
great mystery of toasters: what are they used for?


-----

I couldn’t find my toaster manual, but I did find the one for my vacuum

cleaner. It’s sixty-four pages long and never says what you use a vacuum cleaner
for. In other words, if we were to stick strictly to the official literature, vacuum
cleaners would remain inexplicable. Nobody would know what to do with them,
except the few folks who’d have received the “gift of vacuuming” ( _that is,_
they’d have accidently come up with a proper way to use them).

The hidden sense of vacuum cleaners isn’t found in the manual. It’s a secret

we pass on by word of mouth.

What goes for vacuum cleaners also goes for mathematical theories. But this

fundamental law of learning remains neglected and little known.

## A Language That’s Not Human

Math books aren’t written in the language of humans. That’s what makes

them so hard to read.

The official language of mathematics doesn’t work the same way as the

language we speak every day, and no human could ever be perfectly bilingual.
This artificial language is a purely human invention—undoubtedly one of the
greatest inventions in our long history—conceived of to compensate for the
weaknesses in the language we speak.

Its main particularity is to replace our usual way of defining words with a

radically different approach.

In daily life we never correctly define the words we use. We learn them

through examples. The best way to explain what a banana is, is to show one.
This approach works well enough, but sometimes runs into issues, the most
concrete of which is: when a thing exists only in your head, how do you point
your finger at it?

At a profound level, math is the only successful attempt by humanity to

speak with precision about things that we can’t point to with our fingers. This is
one of the central themes of this book and we’ll come back to it a number of
times.

In a math book, the most important passages aren’t the theorems or the

proofs: they are the definitions. Mathematical language works like building
blocks where words are really _defined_ : that is to say, built from other words that
have themselves been previously defined. When you can’t point your finger at
something, that’s a good way of going about it.

With this approach, the meaning of words is reduced entirely to the letter of

their definition. Words are nothing but abstract shells that mean absolutely


-----

nothing outside the defined meaning: if having a trunk is part of the definition of
an elephant, then an elephant whose trunk has been cut off immediately ceases to
be an elephant.

This approach is called _logical formalism._ It’s so anal retentive that it can be

grotesque. We have no desire to think like that, and, furthermore, we’re not
really capable of it. Only robots and computers are crazy enough to do that.

It’s the price you pay for speaking correctly about invisible things. Even if

logical formalism is fundamentally foreign, we can learn to interact with it, in
the same way that we can learn to interact with robots and computers. They may
annoy us, we may find them ridiculous, but we end up getting used to their
psychology and, at the end of the day, we’re glad to have them work for us.

## Learning to See

Learning math is learning how to use words that are “empty shells,” defined

by logical formalism, as if they were ordinary words. It’s learning to give these
words an intuitive and concrete meaning. It’s _learning to see_ the objects they
point to as if they were right there in front of our eyes. This requires particular
techniques that we’ll talk about in the following chapters.

_See_ isn’t always the right word, since there are many material things you

can’t see. The taste of sugar, the touch of silk, a rhythm, a song, a familiar scent,
the passage of time: these are things we feel without seeing them.

The ability to associate imaginary physical sensations with abstract concepts

is called _synesthesia._ Some people see letters in colors. Others see the days of
the week as if they were positioned in the space around them.

There’s a widespread belief that synesthesia is rare and associated with

certain mental conditions. In reality it’s a universal phenomenon and a core
building block of human cognition. Here’s a little test to see if you’re capable of
synesthesia: looking at the word _chocolate,_ are you able to sense a sound, a
color, a taste? Looking at “999,999,999,” do you get the feeling of something
large?

What is rare, and what our culture doesn’t push you to do, is to be aware of

your capability for synesthesia and to try to develop it systematically. Secret
math is a mental yoga whose goal is to retake control over our ability for
synesthesia.

Nothing I’m saying should surprise you, since nothing about it is new to you.

When you learned to “see” the number 999,999,999 rather than ink on a page, it
was thanks to your command of this mental yoga.


-----

What you could do in your childhood, you should still be able to do today.
Bill Thurston was a master of this art of seeing. In chapter 10 , we’ll talk

about some of the things that he managed to see. It’s so extraordinary that you’ll
find it hard to believe.

We have a lot to learn from him.

## By Humans, for Humans

Now his comment on toasters should start to really make sense. When a

human being looks at a math book, the trick isn’t to read it from beginning to
end, like a robot would. The trick is to get at “the thoughts between the lines”—
that is, to give an intuitive sense to the words being used and the situations being
described.

Math books aren’t written by robots, for robots. They’re written by humans,

for humans. Without our ability to give them meaning, without “the thoughts
between the lines,” there wouldn’t be any math books, exactly for the same
reason that without music there wouldn’t be any musical scores.

The best way of sharing this human understanding is direct communication

between humans. This communication _about mathematics_ is done _in human_
_language._ As Thurston said, it’s never as efficient as when there are only two
people in the room: “One-on-one, people use wide channels of communication
that go far beyond formal mathematical language. They use actions, they draw
pictures and diagrams, they make sound effects and use body language.”

When an important new theorem is proven, Thurston notes that the solution

can often be explained in a few minutes during a private conversation between
two specialists in the subject, whereas explaining the same result in front of an
audience of specialists takes at least an hour. And to communicate the result in a
written form requires a fifteen- or twenty-page paper that even a specialist may
need hours, perhaps days, to understand.

Going from minutes to days is quite a leap. And what’s worse, it’s

discouraging.

## The Magic Touch

Mathematical understanding isn’t some kind of magic power that can be

passed along through touch, but it can seem like it. When you want to
comprehend a mathematical concept, the quickest way is an open discussion
with someone who really understands it.


-----

Professional mathematicians are well aware of this. What worries them the

most is their own difficulty in understanding mathematics. They have the same
problem as everyone, but they know the solution.

When I was a PhD student, I didn’t get ahead in my understanding by

reading books. What I’ve been able to accomplish in my career I owe in large
part to my conversations with Raphael. I was incredibly lucky to share an office
with someone so good at math and so generous with his time.

Raphael’s explanations were never rigorous. Sometimes they were plainly

wrong. But they were always simple and human. They gave meaning. They
made me want more. Raphael explained what a theorem _really meant._ He told
me how an idea had been invented and how you need to understand it “morally.”

“Morally” understanding something means being able to explain it to

yourself intuitively and cite the reason why it’s true: the _moral_ of the story. If
mathematics were simply a question of logic, no such thing would exist. There is
no moral to draw from logical reasoning.

“Moral” explanations, waving your hands around, necessarily leave gray

areas. They explain what toasters are used for and how to put bread into them,
but they never detail their wiring diagrams. If that’s really what you’re interested
in, feel free to go to Definition 7.4 on page 138.

The way of life and the social organization of the math research community

reflect this need for direct conversations. Where astronomers have telescopes or
nuclear physicists have particle accelerators, mathematicians also have their
great scientific instrument: and this instrument is travel.

The trips mathematicians take allow the diffusion of new ideas with an

efficiency otherwise impossible. We love long-term stays. We need time to talk,
take coffee breaks, scribble on the blackboard, and pick up the discussion the
next day with a question that came to us when we woke up. A Japanese
mathematician, Kyoji Saito, wanted to understand the “thoughts between the
lines” of one of my articles, so he often invited me to Kyoto. For my part, it
allowed me to better understand the “thoughts between the lines” of his articles.
These types of trips are part of a mathematician’s life.

## Clear and Intimidating

In the same math class where someone suffers in silence, there’s probably

another student who could explain things in simple language. Why does this
conversation almost never take place?

The certainty of people “bad at math” that they’re naturally inferior plays a


-----

role. They’re too inhibited to ask the right questions, the really simple questions,
the ones that seem stupid but that in fact are fundamental.

Teachers share in the blame. They sometimes foster the illusion that math

can be limited to formal equations. Just as there’s an incredible gap between
those “good” and “bad” at math, there’s an equal gap between “good” math
teachers and “bad” math teachers.

Let me try to explain. In the world of mathematics, toasters arrive

disassembled. We all have to put them together in our own heads. “Bad”
teachers are the ones who recite the 198 steps to assemble the toaster as if that
were the end of the story. “Good” teachers do their best to explain what a toaster
is. They constantly look their students in the eyes, because it’s in their eyes that
they will know if they’ve understood.

Inflicting the 198 steps of putting together the toaster on someone who

doesn’t even know what bread is for is just plain mean. It’s like raising children
without telling them stories. You can’t teach humans the same way you would
teach robots.

I don’t think that “bad” math teachers are deliberately sadistic. Maybe they

don’t put human understanding front and center in mathematics because they
themselves haven’t been taught the right way. Maybe they don’t picture the
toaster in their own head. Or maybe it’s the opposite: when you see the toaster so
well in your own head, sometimes you forget that not everyone else sees it the
same way.

“One person’s clear mental image is another person’s intimidation,”

Thurston wrote.

It’s hard to share mental images, as they are evanescent and profoundly

subjective. Our common language is incapable of transcribing them with
precision. It’s precisely because our intuition is so secretive and so unstable that
logical formalism was invented.

For Thurston, as for most creative mathematicians, mathematics is a sensual

and carnal experience that is located upstream from language. Logical formalism
is at the heart of the apparatus that makes this experience possible. Math books
may be unreadable, but we nevertheless need them. They’re a device that we
rely on in our quest for the true math, the only one that matters: the secret math,
the one that lies in our head.

Which brings us to a natural question. How do people find the courage and

desire to write books that are unreadable, that readers couldn’t care less about,
and that are as dry as the user manual for a toaster? What’s their motivation?
What state of mind gives birth to mathematical creativity?

This is the subject of the next chapter.

## The Child’s Pose

“My dear Serre, Thanks for the various papers you’ve so generously sent me,

as well as for your letter. Nothing new here. I’ve finished my ridiculous piece on
homological algebra.”

This is how Alexander Grothendieck begins a letter written to Jean-Pierre

Serre on November 13, 1956. The casual tone is a bit surprising, especially when
you know who Serre and Grothendieck are, and what the letter is about.

Jean-Pierre Serre is one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth

century. A career isn’t entirely measured by the awards you win, but when
you’ve won them all, that’s saying something. Serre won the Fields Medal in
1954 at the age of twenty-seven, and is still the youngest ever to do so. This
prize is restricted to mathematicians under forty, and for a long time there wasn’t
anything equivalent to a lifetime achievement award in math. This is why the
Abel Prize was created in 2003. The first year of the prize, the awards committee
had a great responsibility: among all living mathematicians, they had to choose
who was to receive the first award. They decided to give it to Serre.

As for Grothendieck, he is much more than a great mathematician. Well

before his death in 2014, he’d already become something of a legend.

He’s one of those rare mathematicians—one of the few throughout history—

whose contributions aren’t limited to profound results or spectacular theories.
Grothendieck invented a way of approaching math that was so rich and new it
was as if he’d changed the very nature of mathematics.


-----

This explains why he’s often considered “the” greatest mathematician of the

twentieth century, insofar as that means anything.

As for the “ridiculous piece on homological algebra,” that was the article

“Some Aspects of Homological Algebra” that appeared in 1957 in a Japanese
scholarly journal, the _Tohoku Mathematical Journal._

This article marked Grothendieck’s entry in the field that would make him

famous. Influenced by Serre, he was just getting started in algebraic geometry.
The two young men began one of the most productive mathematical friendships
in history. Of his first encounter with algebraic geometry, Grothendieck would
later say that he had the impression of “suddenly finding himself in a sort of
‘promised land’ of luxuriant richness.”

Grothendieck would devote fifteen years of his life to mapping out this

“promised land.” Writing was at the heart of his method. He would go as far as
to say that “doing mathematics is above all _writing._ ”

This passion for writing makes his letter to Serre even more enigmatic. The

“ridiculous piece” is quite simply the first tale of Grothendieck’s adventures in
the promised land. He found the piece so ridiculous that finishing the task that
had consumed him for a year was a nonevent. “Nothing new here” are the exact
words he used to announce that he’d just finished writing a historic article.

Was he joking? Probably not. In a 2018 interview Serre recounted that one of

Grothendieck’s peculiarities was his total lack of humor: “I can’t recall having
heard him laugh. You could never joke with him, for example, about


-----

mathematics.”

Hidden behind this apparent paradox lies a profound truth about the nature of

mathematical work. Grothendieck’s detachment and flippancy might seem
incomprehensible, but when you know more about his intellectual approach,
you’ll find it perfectly coherent.

## A Joke in Bad Taste

Everyone knows who Einstein is, but almost no one’s heard of Grothendieck.
Comparing the two isn’t absurd. Einstein revolutionized physicists’ ideas

about space. Grothendieck revolutionized mathematicians’ ideas about space. He
even went so far as to reinvent the concept of a point, and to approach the notion
of truth from a geometric perspective.

Some mathematicians even think that the comparison with Einstein isn’t fair

to Grothendieck. They find Einstein’s work beautiful, elegant, brilliant,
admirable. They say that it’s the work of a genius. As for Grothendieck’s work,
they find it extraordinary, staggering, sublime, terrifying. They say that it can’t
be the work of a human being. Grothendieck’s ideas are not always easy to
understand, but once you understand even a bit, it seems incredible that anyone
could have come up with them.

Jean-Pierre Serre once said about Grothendieck’s work that he personally

would have been incapable of producing it, because “it demands enormous
strength.” When Serre evokes Grothendieck, he talks of “the power of his brain”
and describes a supernatural force: “Physically and intellectually, it was the
same. It was extraordinary. I’ve never known anyone with as much strength. I’ve
met people with incredible intellectual abilities, but Grothendieck was beyond
that. He was a beast.”

Grothendieck himself wasn’t of the same opinion. He didn’t think that he

was more gifted than anyone else. That wasn’t the source of his uncommon
creativity: “This power is in no way some extraordinary gift—like an uncommon
cerebral strength, (shall we say). . . . Such gifts are certainly precious, worthy of
the envy of people (like me) who haven’t been blessed with them at birth,
‘beyond measure.’”

Grothendieck had a different explanation: “The quality of the inventiveness

and the imagination of a researcher comes from the quality of his attention,
listening to the voice of things.”

It almost sounds like the same words from Einstein that we started with in

chapter 1 : “I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.”


-----

But Grothendieck went even further. He knew, however, that no one would

believe him, since these kinds of declarations are never taken seriously: “When
you dare say such things, you see on everyone’s face, from the dullest who are
sure they’re dull, to the smartest who are certain they’re smart and well above
common mortals, the same smiles, part embarrassed, part knowing, as if
someone had made a joke in bad taste.”

Einstein had the reputation of being something of a joker. With

Grothendieck, no need to worry: jokes were not allowed.

It’s too bad we never could have had that conversation with Einstein, the one

in which he would have spilled all the secrets of his creativity, the one in which
he would have agreed to answer our questions and explained in detail _how he_
_really did it._

As for Grothendieck, he wrote a thousand-page book on the subject. He

described in detail what went on in his head when he did mathematics. He
acknowledged his total inability to read any math book, even the most simple, if
he didn’t manage to fabricate the right pictures in his head. He also
acknowledged his inability to follow along during conferences because they
always went too fast for him. He explained his way of getting by with the feeling
of not knowing anything. And most of all he explained the exact place where he
was finding pleasure in all that.

This extraordinary tale is called _Harvests and Sowings_ ( _Récoltes et_

_semailles_ ). The manuscript remained unpublished for a long time, circulating
clandestinely for over thirty-five years until someone finally dared to publish it _._
The first legal edition appeared in 2022, published by Éditions Gallimard in
Paris. A forthcoming English-language edition is being prepared by MIT Press.

## The Most Breathtaking Account

“What drives and dominates my work, its soul and reason for being, are the

mental images formed during the course of the work to apprehend the reality of
mathematical things. . . . All my life I’ve been unable to read a mathematical
text, however trivial or simple it may be, unless I’m able to give this text a
‘meaning’ in terms of my experience of mathematical things, that is unless the
text arouses in me mental images, intuitions that will give it life.”

Many such illuminating excerpts can be isolated from _Harvests and Sowings_ ,

one of the most fascinating books I’ve ever read. Yet I can’t really recommend
it, or at least not without a serious caveat: Grothendieck’s monologue is a long
and disconcerting rant, alternatively brilliant and confused, with prophetic


-----

overtones, interlocking metaphors and allegories, notes and digressions strewn
about the bottom of the page, all with their own notes and digressions. He gets
lost for hundreds of pages in personal grievances and unfounded recriminations
that are, quite frankly, almost unreadable.

It’s a text meant for the initiated, and even the initiated have a hard time

making it through to the end. A frequent opinion, however, is that _Harvests and_
_Sowings_ is the most breathtaking account ever written about the mathematical
experience.

Like many of my mathematician friends, I’ve found stunning passages of

truth and clarity, moments when I stopped reading and said to myself: “He’s
right. That’s it exactly. That’s really it, the secret. That’s how it really happens in
our heads. It’s precisely in making these simple mental actions, which seem so
innocent but which no one had dreamed of doing, that you get really good at
math. I’ve never read anything as important. I need to find a way to tell the
world and explain what Grothendieck is trying to say.”

I’m aware, however, that in the raw, Grothendieck’s thought is far too

enigmatic. In the end, it’s a bit like the problem with Einstein. There’s no longer
the possibility of having a frank and direct conversation with him, to ask the
simple and naïve questions.

Grothendieck went considerably further than Einstein and left us incredible

details. But he did so as an isolated man, ahead of his time, aware that people
were not yet ready to hear his message. To make sense of his account, we need
to relate it to our common experience.

Before sharing with you what I’ve personally taken away from my reading,

what has echoed my own experience, I should tell you a bit more about
Grothendieck’s life and his uncommon personality.

## A Wild Child

Alexander Grothendieck was born in Berlin in 1928. His parents were

militant anarchists who had to flee the Nazi regime. In 1933, when he was five
years old, his mother entrusted him to the care of the family of Wilhelm
Heydorn, a Lutheran pastor in Hamburg.


-----

Up until this time, Grothendieck seems to have received a rather unusual

education, formed by the anarchist principles of his parents. His adoptive
mother, Dagmar Heydorn, described him upon his arrival as a wild child, dirty
and lacking any form of inhibition. When she entrusted the Heydorns with her
son, Hanka Grothendieck did so on the condition that they never send him to
school, and never cut his hair.

The Heydorns cut his hair and sent him to school. It was probably the only

peaceful and “normal” period of his life. He retained throughout his life strong
ties of affection with his adoptive family.

In April 1939, fearing for his safety (Grothendieck’s father was Jewish), the

Heydorns put him on a train to Paris, where he reunited with his exiled parents.
His father was arrested shortly afterwards, and would die in Auschwitz in 1942.
Beginning in 1940, Grothendieck and his mother lived in the South of France, in
refugee camps.

Their life began to resemble clichés from Hollywood movies: the refugee

mother and son in postwar France, scratching out a living doing housework or
harvesting; the son’s spectacular talent forming in isolation, without anyone
taking notice.

In 1948, the atypical student was finally spotted by one of his professors at

the University of Montpellier, who wrote him a letter of recommendation to Élie
Cartan, a prominent mathematician with great influence. This is how at twenty
years old Grothendieck made his way to Paris and was introduced to cutting-


-----

edge mathematical research by some of the most brilliant minds of his time.

Laurent Schwartz, who himself was about to receive the Fields Medal, had

him read his latest article, which ended with a list of fourteen problems that he
had been unable to solve. It’s the kind of list an ambitious student could dig
through for a good PhD subject: choose a problem, spend three years thinking
about it, get your advisor to help you find an incomplete solution, and
everyone’s happy. Grothendieck went off to his room and came back a few
months later. He’d solved all fourteen problems.

Until 1970, Grothendieck climbed ever higher on the ladder that separates an

unknown refugee from the heights of global science. He became the greatest, the
strongest, the best. He worked harder than anyone else. A whole research
institute was created around him. He won the Fields Medal in 1966, but that is
merely anecdotal in comparison to everything else he accomplished.
Grothendieck and his students set out on the immense and visionary task of
reconstructing algebraic geometry from the ground up. Their work still provides
the basis for a large part of current mathematical research.

But in 1970, at the age of forty-two, Grothendieck made a sudden break from

his scientific career. He resigned from the institute created around him and
opened a new chapter in his life, dedicated to militantism and radical ecology.

It was in the mid-1980s, about fifteen years after this break, that he wrote

_Harvests and Sowings._ His intention was to write a book for the general public
because he believed he had an important message to deliver. In a letter he wrote
in 2010, he acknowledged that he didn’t entirely succeed: “This ‘Reflection and
Testimonial’ on my life as a mathematician, unreadable as it is I admit, has much
meaning for me, if not to anyone else!”

From 1991 until his death in 2014, Grothendieck retired from the world. He

lived as a recluse in the small village of Lasserre in Southern France at the foot
of the Pyrenees Mountains, where he practiced meditation and led an existence
of extreme solitude and asceticism. He went as far as trying to live entirely on
dandelion soup.

Grothendieck never stopped writing. He left behind him immense quantities

of mathematical, philosophical, and mystical writings, among which, it seems, is
a thirty-thousand-page meditation on “the problem of Evil.”

The connection of the mathematical experience with madness is a subject we

can’t seem to ignore. We’ll come back to it in chapter 17 .

## “The gift of solitude”


-----

“Discovery is the privilege of the child. I’m talking about young children,

children who aren’t yet afraid to make mistakes, to look like fools, not to be
serious, not to act like everyone else. They’re also not afraid if the things they’re
looking at have the bad taste of being different from what was expected from
them, what they were supposed to be.”

This quotation from _Harvests and Sowings_ sounds like something we’ve

heard thousands of times before, but that is clearly not true. And even if it were
true, what good does that do us? We’ll never be young children again.

But it’s obviously a metaphor. Grothendieck is alluding to the child who is

present “within us” and with whom “we have lost contact.” His book is actually
addressed not to us but to the _lost child within us,_ as he makes perfectly clear
from the onset: “It’s to the one within you who knows how to be alone, to the
child, that I wish to speak, and to no one else.”

Grothendieck explains his uncommon creativity by the proximity he

maintains with his inner child: “In me, and for reasons I have not yet dreamed of
exploring, a certain innocence has survived.”

He describes this as a “gift of solitude,” the capacity to find himself “alone

and listening to things, intensely absorbed in a child’s game.”

“Seeking and finding, that is to say, questioning and listening, is the

simplest, the most spontaneous thing in the world, that no one has sole rights to.
It’s a ‘gift’ that we all received in the cradle.”

Whatever one thinks of Grothendieck, of his strangeness, his eccentricities,

his bizarre obsessions, it’s worth listening to him. Whether or not he’s using the
right words, he clearly knows what he’s talking about.

_Harvests and Sowings_ often reads like a yoga manual, and in a way that’s

exactly what it is. Behind the metaphors and personal anecdotes, the text
describes a certain way of holding your body, a peculiar physical attitude, an
unusual relationship to language and truth.

Grothendieck was a great yogi who invented his own meditation technique.

It’s centered on a radical form of curiosity and indifference to judgment, what
we might call _the child’s pose._

All mathematicians develop techniques of this sort, but they’re rarely aware

of it, and rarely know how to explain it. Grothendieck hands us the user’s
manual.

This psychic posture is clearly at the heart of his work method. Roughly,

here’s what it consists of.


-----

## “I believe, more or less, in my assertions”

Opening a math book on a subject you know nothing about is a bit like

finding yourself in the pilot’s seat of a commercial jet or the command post of a
nuclear generator. There are a lot of buttons and screens, but you have no clue
how they work and an intense desire not to make a mistake. You would love to
know how it all works, but you don’t. The normal reaction is to stay seated and
not touch anything. Before making any move you need to study and think about
it.

But if you put any two-year-old in the pilot’s seat, they’ll act differently.

They’ll push all the buttons, starting with ones that are red or blinking.

Grothendieck’s recommendation is to act like the two-year-old. When he

wants to understand something, he goes straight at it, without hesitations, as a
child would. He doesn’t wait to understand before launching into it. He acts
without thinking, a bit haphazardly:

When I’m curious about a thing, mathematical or otherwise, I **interrogate** it. I interrogate it,
without worrying about whether my question is or will seem to be stupid, certainly without it being
well thought out. Often the question takes the form of an assertion—an assertion which, in truth, is
an exploratory probe. I believe, more or less, in my assertions. . . . Often, especially at the outset of
my research, the assertion is completely false—still, it was necessary to make it to convince myself.

We need to clarify what he means by _interrogating things, asking questions,_

and _probing._ Throughout his book, Grothendieck describes mathematical work
as a succession of concrete physical activities. But what does _interrogating_
_things_ mean exactly? If I want to interrogate things, how do I go about it?
Looked at closely, this isn’t clear at all. The same can be said about this other
favorite phrase of Grothendieck: _listening to the voice of things._ What does that
even mean?

As long as we’re here, what is a _mathematical thing?_ Where can we find

these things, and how do we initiate contact with them?

Grothendieck never bothers to explain precisely, undoubtedly because he is

so used to talking with these things that he’s forgotten that he himself had to
learn how to do it.

Mathematical things are the things that nonmathematicians call mathematical

_concepts_ or mathematical _abstractions._ They may consist of numbers, sets,
spaces, different kinds of geometric shapes, or other types of abstract structures.
Mathematicians prefer to call them mathematical _objects,_ because imagining
these things as material objects that one can touch makes it easier to understand
them.


-----

_Interrogating things, listening to the voice of things,_ means trying to imagine

them, examining the mental images that form within you, seeking to solidify
these images and make them clearer, working at unveiling more and more
details, as when you try to recall a dream.

## The Pleasure of Being Proved Wrong

This approach needs to be translated in concrete terms. The language of

_Harvests and Sowings_ is so imagistic that you might think keeping it vague was
a deliberate choice.

This impression is false. Grothendieck endeavored to be precise. His

enigmatic vocabulary was meant to solve a practical problem: he’s describing
actions that we perform in our heads and mental images that we manipulate, but
our language is missing the right words. There is no specific vocabulary to talk
plainly of these actions and images. No one has taken the time to even tell us we
have the right to talk about them.

The child’s pose isn’t an allegory. It’s a very precise mental attitude.
The basic principle is simple yet revolutionary. It’s the kind of idea that

almost no one thinks of because it’s too simple and it goes against our instincts.
The kind of idea, precisely, that has the potential to change everything, at all
levels of math learning, including the absolute beginners and the self-professed
lousy at math.

When you come across a new mathematical concept, it’s hard to imagine it.

It is presented to you by means of an abstract definition, a string of words on a
page or words spoken by a professor. This string of words doesn’t make any
sense to you. It has no intuitive meaning.

Students generally don’t feel like they have the right to imagine

mathematical objects that they don’t yet understand. They feel they need to
know more before daring to picture them. In the meantime, they’re content to try
to decipher word by word, symbol by symbol. They may not understand what
they’re reading, it might give them a headache, but they tell themselves that if
they keep on trying they’ll get to the point where they feel confident enough to
finally imagine what’s behind the words. But this approach almost never works.

Grothendieck did it differently. He knew that it was worthless to gather

information about things that you can’t yet see. Instead, he allowed himself to
imagine the things right away, without waiting, even when he was well aware
that it might not work and his mental images would likely be terribly wrong.

He wasn’t afraid of failure. He was even certain that he would be wrong, and


-----

that’s exactly what he was looking for.

Grothendieck actively sought out the error as a young child actively seeks

mischief. In his exploration of the world of mathematics, each time he found
something bizarre or intriguing, unclear or unsatisfactory, incoherent or
disagreeable, that’s where he began digging.

When something was off in his vision of the world, it made him feel uneasy.

He dug around to find the source of this unease, since that was the only way to
relieve it. Finding mistakes gave him pleasure, relief. “Finding mistakes is a
crucial moment, above all a creative moment, in all work of discovery, whether
it’s in mathematics or within oneself. It’s a moment when our knowledge of the
thing being examined is suddenly renewed.”

What Grothendieck wrote about error is of universal significance, well

beyond the field of science. It makes you want to engrave his words on school
façades:

Fear of mistakes and fear of the truth is one and the same thing. The person who fears being wrong
is powerless to discover anything new. It’s when we fear making a mistake that the error which is
inside of us becomes immovable as a rock.

Not many people realize that the main obstacles in mathematics are

psychological, not only at the beginning but all throughout, up to the highest
levels. As we leave childhood behind, we learn to fear looking stupid. We learn
to be ashamed of our mistakes. We learn to hide, even to ourselves, the fact that
we know almost nothing. To get ahead in math, we need to deactivate this reflex
for dissimulation. And it’s not easy.

At the age when we were still free to ask stupid questions, even to ask the

same stupid questions hundreds of times in a row, no one hated math. The great
mathematicians invent and put in place special techniques to recover this lost
childhood innocence. They all say it’s indispensable. We’ll come back to this in
chapter 13 .

## The Driving Force of Learning

When Grothendieck talks of “the error which is inside of us,” that has

nothing to do with logic. It’s not an error of computation or reasoning. The error
Grothendieck is talking of is one of intuition, an error of vision: the image that
we have of things isn’t correct.

As we’ll see throughout this book, mathematical understanding is achieved

by gradually modifying the way we represent things to ourselves, and making


-----

them clearer, more precise, closer to reality.

You sometimes hear people say that the two hemispheres of our brains

function differently. The left side of the brain specializes in logical reasoning
and calculation, while the right side specializes in associative reasoning and
intuition.

This nonsensical interpretation of our anatomy dates from the 1960s and has

long since been discredited. In reality the two sides of our brains closely
resemble one another and, at a profound level, both function associatively and
intuitively. The organ that allows you to see the world in a logical manner
doesn’t exist. If you’re counting on that to become good at math, you’ll have a
long wait.

Our prodigious faculty for learning and invention has its origin in our

unconscious ability to constantly reconfigure the fabric of associations of images
and sensations that, literally and figuratively, comprise the real structure of our
thought.

All our great learning achievements rely on this mental plasticity. Error plays

a fundamental role, as it is the driving force of plasticity. Learning to see, to
walk, use a spoon, tie your shoelaces, talk, read and write, is always about
reconfiguring your brain. And it’s never done in one shot. Children don’t learn
how to walk until they’ve tried and failed. They need to fall in order to learn
how to stand up. It’s the accumulation of errors that allow them to develop their
intuitive sense of balance.

As for every motor learning, understanding a new mathematical concept

proceeds by a reconfiguring of intuition, and that requires a “feeling-out” phase.
Once transposed to the context of walking, Grothendieck’s comments on the role
of error become even more illuminating:

_Fear of falling and fear of walking are one and the same thing. The person_

_who fears falling on their face is powerless to learn how to walk._ _It’s only when_
_we stay on our ass that our initial clumsiness turns into physical disability._

## The Role of Logic

In the world of mental images, the laws of physics don’t apply. You can

imagine anything, even inconsistent things, without falling on your face. The
error that is inside of us can become immovable as a rock without our even
being aware of it.

It’s precisely here that the mathematical approach diverges from our usual

way of using our intuition. Mathematicians have invented a method that lets


-----

them discover the errors inside themselves. This method relies on writing—more
precisely, on writing in the official language of mathematics, constructed on
logical formalism.

Logic doesn’t help you think. It helps you find out where you’re thinking

wrong.

When Grothendieck sends out “probes” to interrogate objects he wants to

understand, he gets his answer by writing:

Often, you only have to write it down for you to see it’s incorrect, whereas before writing there was
a vagueness, a bad feeling, instead of this evidence. That now allows you to start over without this
lack of knowledge, with a question-assertion perhaps a little less off the mark.

As opposed to biologists, who write their articles only _after_ having done

their experiments, mathematicians write _during_ their research work, because
writing is itself part of the research. Here’s what Grothendieck says:

The role of writing is not to record the results of research, but is the process itself of research.

I have always made every effort to describe in the most meticulous way possible, using
mathematical language, these images and the understanding they bring. It is in this continuous effort
to articulate the inarticulable, to define what is as yet unclear, that the particular dynamic of
mathematical work (and perhaps as well all creative intellectual work) is perhaps found.

Mathematical writing is the work of transcribing a living (but confused,

unstable, nonverbal) intuition into a precise and stable (but as dead as a fossil)
text.

Or, rather, it would be a simple job of transcription if the intuition was from

the outset precise and correct. But intuition is rarely precise and correct from the
outset. At first it’s vague and wrong, and it always remains a bit so. Through the
work of writing, intuition becomes less and less vague and less and less wrong.
This process is slow and gradual.

Mathematical creation is a constant back-and-forth between imagination (the

art of picturing what you read) and verbalization (the art of putting words to
what you see). This simultaneously transforms our intuition and our language.
We learn to see and, at the same time, we learn to talk. We learn to picture new
things and we invent a language that allows us to name them. The whole
process, according to Grothendieck, amounts to “gathering intangible mists from
out of an apparent void.”

The result of this work shows up in two different ways. The first incarnation

is invisible: it’s the modification of the understanding of the world and the state


-----

of consciousness of the person who produced the work. The second incarnation
is the mathematical text.

Grothendieck knew that this second incarnation, the printed one, was the

only one he could show. But it wasn’t what drove him. For him, “it’s not in this
form that you find the soul of understanding mathematical things.”

The effort of writing allowed Grothendieck to develop his own intuition.

Once he had a clear idea, he could look at his own articles with detachment, as if
they were user manuals for toasters.

## The Diplodocus

In the next chapter, we’ll see how the peculiarities of mathematical language

make it an incredible tool of mental clarification.

But we’ll end this chapter by going back to the mystery we began with: the

casual tone of the letter that the young Grothendieck, at age twenty-eight, wrote
to Serre on November 13, 1956, to announce that he’d just finished his
“ridiculous piece.”

In June 1955, seventeen months earlier, Grothendieck had written to Serre to

share with him his first notes. The tone was enthusiastic, as Grothendieck was in
the initial phase of discovery. He probed into things, made massive errors, and
achieved rapid progress. At the time he still qualified some passages in his notes
as “unlaid eggs” that were potentially “screwed up.”

In the year that followed, Grothendieck brooded upon his “eggs.” He

watched them hatch and patiently fed the bizarre creature that emerged. As the
manuscript grew and gained structure, Serre and Grothendieck spoke about it
with a growing glibness, going so far as to give it a nickname: the “diplodocus.”

The big ideas were in place. The pleasure of discovery, the pleasure of

finally understanding, was already fading. Surprises were becoming rare. It was
simply a matter of putting on the finishing touches, the technical details, of
conforming to the bureaucratic requirements of the official language of
mathematics.

In the final months of editing, the writing became an ordeal. Grothendieck

began to worry whether anyone would want to publish his ridiculous piece. He
chose the Japanese _Tohoku Mathematical Journal_ because “it seems that really
long articles don’t bother them.”

In his letter to Serre, Grothendieck goes as far as excusing himself. He may

have created a monster, but he didn’t have any choice: “It’s the only way I have
of understanding, through sheer persistence, how things work.”


-----

## The Theory of Touch

Among the books one never reads, apart from math books and user manuals

for toasters, one mustn’t forget dictionaries.

When I was a child, I was fascinated by dictionaries. Their promise is to

define every word using other words. But do they keep this promise? Can they
really function as a gateway to language? When you want to learn words from
the ground up, which page do you turn to?

If you don’t know what a banana is, the dictionary will teach you it’s “an

elongated curved tropical fruit of a banana plant, which grows in bunches and
has a creamy flesh and a smooth skin; in particular, the sweet, yellow fruit of the
Cavendish banana cultivar.” But what is a banana plant? It’s “the tropical treelike plant which bears clusters of bananas, a plant of the genus _Musa_ (but
sometimes also including plants from _Ensete_ ), which has large, elongated
leaves.”

That’s not wrong, but it’s pretty confusing. The definition is bizarrely

tortured and complicated, and most of all, it’s circular: the banana is the fruit of
a banana plant, which have bananas for fruit. Why not cut to the chase and just
say a banana is a banana, as this seems to be the main message?

You don’t explain what a banana is to someone who doesn’t know with a

bunch of convoluted phrases. To show what we really think about bananas, the
simplest and most honest definition is still the one we give to children: “Try it!
It’s good!”

Dictionaries are filled with circular definitions.
What is heat? “The condition of being hot.” What is hot? “Having or giving

off a high temperature.” What’s a temperature? “A measure of cold or heat,
often measurable with a thermometer.” What’s a thermometer? “An apparatus
used to measure temperature.” What is truth? “Characteristic of what is true.”
True? “That which conforms to the truth.”


-----

From a logical standpoint, dictionaries are giant Ponzi schemes. If people

truly relied on them to find out about bananas, the fraud would have been
denounced long ago.

But that’s not how we do it. Our approach isn’t logical. We don’t learn

words through their definitions. We assimilate language bit by bit, by successive
clarifications. Our brain has the ability to see things before knowing how to
name them, to recognize words before understanding their meaning, and to
gradually associate the words with what we see.

We start from zero, literally. We don’t start from dictionaries. We start with

life and the common experiences we share with others.

## Starting from Zero

Mathematical definitions resemble definitions in dictionaries, with one slight

difference: they actually define things.

As opposed to dictionaries, math books don’t simply make connections

between words that already exist. They don’t limit themselves to things you can
point to or that we have a shared experience with.

A mathematical definition is neither a commentary nor an explication: it is

the exact assembly guide of a new mental image and the “birth certificate” of the
new word chosen to designate it. (In practice, existing words are often reused,
receiving new meanings that may have no direct relation to what these words
mean in everyday life.)

In that sense, mathematical definitions have the power of creation: they bring

things into existence. It may seem silly to speak so pompously, but that’s what
really happens.

When you see things that others don’t yet perceive, sharing your vision

requires finding a way to get others to re-create those things in their own heads.
A mathematical definition serves this purpose. It provides detailed instructions
allowing others, starting with things they are already able to see, to _mentally_
_construct_ those new things.

## An Enormous Factor of Expansion

In theory, everyone should be able to read math books. Unlike dictionaries,

they contain no circular definitions. No implicit knowledge is required, and
whenever it is necessary readers are referred back to previous references where
they can find the definition of words they’re not yet familiar with. Since the


-----

instructions are clear and all the details are given, there shouldn’t be any
obstacles to understanding.

In practice, however, from the beginning lines of a math book we’re faced

with a huge problem: it’s fantastically difficult to explain a mental image in
words.

As Thurston remarked, “There is sometimes a huge expansion factor in

translating from the encoding in my own thinking to something that can be
conveyed to someone else.”

The result is often unpalatable. When Thurston speaks of a “huge expansion

factor,” he doesn’t mean that it will be two or three times as long. He means that
the written transcription of what seems obvious to us might be ten, a hundred, or
a thousand times as long as the summary we make for ourselves in our head.
And even then you’ll have to leave aside a bunch of details you won’t have the
heart to write down.

The phenomenon Thurston describes isn’t limited to high-level research. It

shows up as soon as we try to faithfully describe even the simplest of our mental
images. An image is worth a thousand words, and unfortunately that also applies
to images that exist only in our heads.

To get a better idea of this, let’s pick up one of our favorite examples. How

much time does it take you to visualize what you do when you tie your shoes?
Two seconds? Three? Now take pen and paper and try to describe each
movement exactly, so that an absolute beginner could follow your instructions
and get the same result. There is a difficult version of this exercise where only
words are allowed. But the easier version, where you can use drawings, is
already immensely hard.

Once you grasp the degree of this difficulty, you’ll understand something

fundamental and profoundly comforting: a math book might seem to be terribly
complicated even though the ideas are quite simple.

There’s really no reason to be afraid of mathematical writings. Not only is

the reading between the lines Thurston talks about possible, but it’s necessarily
simpler than the text itself.

But before getting to this simple understanding, while you still don’t have

the right mental images, you’ll have to go through a lot of trial and error.

## The Art of Clarity

It’s not surprising if you couldn’t find the words to describe how you tie your

shoes. Most likely, you didn’t even try. Writing mathematics, that is,


-----

transcribing mental images with enough clarity and precision to allow others to
understand and reproduce them, is an art.

What makes it so difficult is that your mental images are often a lot less clear

than you think. What keeps the knot you make in your shoelaces from coming
undone? If you don’t know, you don’t really know what it takes to tie it right.

As Grothendieck explained, the art of mathematical writing is really a dual

task of the clarification of ideas and the refinement of language. It’s a delicate
exercise of motor coordination and requires years of practice to master. The
good news is that with patience and effort anyone has the ability to get better.

Learning to write math is learning to have clear ideas. Wouldn’t it be a

shame to deprive yourself of that?

By writing math yourself, you’ll get to understand why it is written in such a

bizarre formalism, in this language made for robots: there’s really no other
choice.

To demonstrate, we’ll return to another of our favorite examples: the concept

of shapes, such as you discovered in your early childhood. Imagine an
alternative universe where you were the first person to discover the concept of
shapes. How would you explain in words your method of distinguishing stars
from squares and putting the right blocks in the right holes?

## The Patience Game

In this alternative universe the visual culture is so impoverished that the

_shape game_ is called the _patience game,_ because the only known method to
solve the problem is through hours of trial and error.

There’s no geometric language. There’s no word for “round,” “square,” or

“triangle.” The word _heart_ is used only for the muscle that beats in our chest. If
you used this word to point out one of the pieces in the patience game, no one
would understand you. The same thing with the word _star._ Stars shine in the
night sky but no one would see the relation to the patience game. The question’s
not even whether the stars have five, six, or seven points. People are far from
that. And besides, where do you get the idea that stars should have _points?_ What
does that even mean?


-----

In your way of seeing the world, in your inner language, you accept the idea

that stars have points and you recognize a five-pointed star as one of the blocks
in the patience game. Why not? Except that so far this idea exists only in your
head.

The others aren’t blind. They are biologically capable of seeing the same

shapes as you. But they haven’t yet learned how. Their brain receives the same
raw visual information but doesn’t structure it in the same way.

“Look, this block is in the shape of a star. There’s a hole also in the shape of

a star. If you take this block and put it in this hole, the right way, it goes in on
the first try.”

This kind of explanation doesn’t work. People can’t see the star that’s in

front of their eyes. They may very well live in the same world as you, but their
mental experiences are different. They’d laugh out loud if they saw you solve the
game without trial and error. You’d look like a magician.

## The Theory of Touch

Instead of geometry, the inhabitants of the alternative universe have a highly

developed sense of touch. Schoolchildren are all taught the _theory of touch._ They
learn how to run their fingers along surfaces and recognize textures. They learn
soft, hard, smooth, rough, grooved, stringy, raspy, friable, porous.

When they hold a block, they readily identify some protruding edges (what


-----

they call _points_ ) and also some concave grooves where their fingers get stuck
(these are called _pits_ ).

It might not be much, but it’s a starting point. The power of math lies in its

ability to extend language with new words that are precisely defined. By relying
on things people already understand, you construct new ones that they can’t
immediately feel but that they can nevertheless manipulate through definitions.

By playing around with these new words, hopefully they’ll end up someday

really understanding them.

To talk about triangles, stars, and squares without relying on the language of

vision, you have to reconstruct these concepts by relying on the vocabulary of
touch. You can’t simply point your finger and say, “Look, that’s a star.” This
inability to rely on a shared experience will pose tremendous difficulties in
writing and you’ll end up with a complicated and unfathomable text. But it’s
doable.

This is what the result might look like. Careful: the following few pages are

written in a style that greatly resembles official math. Consequently, they are
quite frankly a pain to read.

## Tactile Theory of the Patience Game, for Beginners

When you run your finger along the edge of a block (or hole), you come

across a series of points and pits. Let’s give a name to this series of points and
pits, and call it the _signature_ of the block (or hole). For example, there’s a block
(the one you want to call triangle, except that this word doesn’t yet exist) whose
signature is:

_point, point, point_

and a hole (the one that fits the block) whose signature is:

_pit, pit, pit._

As always with mathematical definitions, the name is arbitrary. I chose

“signature,” but I could have chosen a different name and it wouldn’t change
anything, since the meaning I assign to the word is entirely contained in the
definition, without any direct relation to its everyday meaning. But since I have
the choice, I may as well pick a word that helps readers, a word whose everyday
meaning might help them understand the mathematical one. _Signature_ seems


-----

good to me since it evokes the idea that the signature lets you identify individual
blocks and holes. If this word doesn’t work for you, feel free to use another.

The definition I’ve given, however, has a minor technical problem: the same

object can have a number of different signatures, depending on where you start.
To be rigorous, therefore, we should talk about “a” signature rather than “the”
signature. For example, take a block (the one you want to call a star) whose
signature is:

_point, pit, point, pit, point, pit, point, pit, point, pit._

But if you start your finger at a different place you could also come up with

this signature:

_pit, point, pit, point, pit, point, pit, point, pit, point._

What matters isn’t the signature itself but the _signature up to rotation._ But

this notion needs to be properly defined. To do this, I first need an intermediate
notion: the _elementary rotation_ of a signature is defined as the signature obtained
by taking the first word and putting it at the end. For example, the elementary
rotation of

_pit, point, point, point_

is

_point, point, point, pit._

The two signatures are _equivalent up to rotation_ if you can go from one to

the other by a series of elementary rotations. For example, the four following
signatures are equivalent up to rotation:

_pit, point, point, point_
_point, point, point, pit_
_point, point, pit, point_
_point, pit, point, point._

Each line is obtained from the previous one by applying an elementary

rotation. If you apply yet another elementary rotation to the last line, you’ll get


-----

back to the first.

Definition. A _shape_ is an equivalence class of signatures up to rotation.

To make sense of this definition, you need to know what an _equivalence_

_class_ is. It’s a basic mathematical concept, and you’ll find the definition in any
set theory textbook. In practice, it means any signature defines a form and that
two signatures define the same form if and only if they are equivalent up to
rotation. Taken together, the four signatures above constitute an example of an
equivalence class of signatures up to rotation.

If I wanted to, I could continue to invent words. I could define triangles,

circles, and squares in terms of their signatures. For example, a triangle would be
defined as a shape whose signature is:

_point, point, point._

In the same way I could choose to define a _star with n points_ as the form

whose signature is obtained by repeating _n_ times the formula _point, pit._ In the
particular case of the five-pointed star, the signature would be:

_point, pit, point, pit, point, pit, point, pit, point, pit._

A _heart,_ by definition, is a star with a single point.
The language of signatures and shapes will enable us to describe a solution

to the patience game that eliminates the need for patience.

Definition. The _mirror image_ of a signature is the series of words obtained from the signature by
systematically replacing the word _pit_ with the word _point_ and the word _point_ with the word _pit._

Thus the mirror of _point, point, point_ is _pit, pit, pit_ and vice versa. If the two

signatures are equivalent up to rotation, their mirror images are as well, and so
the concept of mirror images extends to shapes. The main result of the theory of
the patience game is as follows:

Theorem. For each block B there exists a unique hole H such that the shape of H is the mirror image
of the shape of B, and H is the only hole B can fit into.

This can be turned into a simple method to determine which block fits in


-----

which hole:

1. Run your finger around a block to determine its shape.
2. Run your finger around each hole until you recognize the corresponding

mirror shape.

3. Once the mirror shape is found, you know you have the right hole, and you

can fit the block into it.

## Real Pleasure

As with all mathematical definitions, our definition of shapes may seem

arbitrary and unwieldy.

The good news is that we’ve managed to talk about shapes using the

vocabulary of tactile experience, without any reference to visual perception. In
other words, we’ve found a way to describe the shape of a star in a language a
person without sight could understand. This undoubtedly is a tremendous feat.

The bad news is that our definition is ugly. It absolutely fails to capture the

richness and beauty of the visual experience, and all that shapes represent for us:
their obviousness, their universality, their unescapable presence, and everything
that makes us love them. For all this our definition is a very poor substitute.

But it would be stupid to think we’ve finished. We’ve only just begun. To

unravel the ball of yarn of what a shape really is, our definition is a poor
beginning among innumerable other possible beginnings. Nothing prevents us
from working harder and crafting a language that will capture with more and
more finesse what it means for a star to be more or less pointed, more or less
elongated, more or less distorted, and so on.

Yet extending the vocabulary, adding precision and detail, won’t fix the

issue. Our problem runs deeper. Seeing isn’t a question of words. Seeing is a
sensory, instinctive experience that we live without having to think about.

Saying that a shape is an _equivalence class of signatures up to rotation_ ,

saying that a star is _a shape whose signature is obtained by repeating_ n _times the_
_pattern “point, pit,”_ is clever enough, but it can never be entirely satisfactory.
We’re not robots. We have no wish to apprehend the world through a language
that seems to have been invented by dystopian bureaucrats. We want to “see”
without thinking about it.

When you puzzle over a text written in the official language of mathematics,

you’re in the situation of a sightless person who is working out our formal
definition of stars without being able to see them. It’s absolute gibberish, at least


-----

at first, as long as you’re unable to get an intuitive sense of the definition and
access “the thoughts between the lines.”

Mathematical comprehension is precisely this: finding the means of creating

within yourself the right mental images in place of a formal definition, to turn
this definition into something intuitive, to “feel” what it is really talking about.

Understanding a mathematical text that defines a star as _a shape whose_

_signature is obtained by repeating_ n _times the pattern “point, pit,”_ is to get to a
point where you forget the formal definition and sense directly what a star is, on
command, with the simple mention of the word _star._

The real pleasure of mathematics is waking up one day and realizing that you

can see stars in your head, which you’d never been able to do before.

The secret techniques of mathematicians aim to facilitate and accelerate this

intuitive understanding. Mathematicians use logic and language as an apparatus
for _learning to see._

I know that seems too good to be true, and it probably feels way out of your

league. That is, however, not the case. You have the ability to start with an
abstract definition and intuitively sense what it designates. You’ve already done
this.

No one has ever described to you, other than through a complex assemblage

of abstract mathematical concepts, the number that you can picture in your head
by taking a billion and subtracting one.

Its written form as 999,999,999, which gives you the impression that the

number is physically present on the page in front of you, is just the shorthand
notation for an incredibly complex formal definition. It characterizes this
number as the result of a chain of additions and multiplications that, if you tried
to imagine it, would give you a headache:

_Nine plus nine times ten plus nine times ten times ten plus nine times ten times ten times ten plus_
_nine times ten times ten times ten times ten plus nine times ten times ten times ten times ten times ten_
_plus nine times ten times ten times ten times ten times ten times ten plus nine times ten times ten_
_times ten times ten times ten times ten times ten plus nine times ten times ten times ten times ten_
_times ten times ten times ten times ten._

On paper, this number is an abstract assemblage, logical and cold. Yet in

your head, it’s a simple object, concrete and clear as day.


-----

## Something’s Going on Here

During my school years, I was often told that I wasn’t holding my pen

correctly, and that’s why I wrote like a pig.

I chose to study math because I thought that they’d teach me how to “hold”

math correctly in my head. I did it my own way and that worked well enough,
but I was never at all certain that my way was the right one.

My biggest surprise, throughout my studies and scientific career, was never

having received any formal education in the subject, as if it weren’t serious or
worth the time.

I was, no doubt, a bit naïve, but it seemed to me that the central problem in

math wasn’t whether such and such theorem was true, but why it was so easy for
some and so difficult for others. After high school, in my first year as an
undergrad, I was expecting that the first class would focus on the right way to
mentally manipulate mathematical concepts. Surely they’d begin by explaining
how to do it!

But the first class was on a different subject. In official math, the starting

point isn’t the unseen actions that you do in your head, it’s formal logic and set
theory. The explanation I was waiting for didn’t come in the next class, or the
one after that. In the end I gave up waiting for it.

The question, however, came up again a few weeks later, as we began the

study of vector spaces in arbitrary dimensions. That’s when I became seriously
preoccupied with it.

A one-dimensional vector space is just a line. A two-dimensional vector

space is a plane. We live in a three-dimensional vector space, or rather we have
the tendency to believe we do, even if Einstein showed us how that’s not entirely
true.

There’s no reason to stop at three. With logical formalism, you can keep

going. You can define what a four-dimensional space is, five-dimensional, six-


-----

dimensional, and so on. If you wanted to, you could do geometry in 24
dimensions, or 196,883 dimensions, or dimension _n,_ where _n_ is any whole
number.

These spaces aren’t laboratory curiosities. They are fundamental concepts,

without which we can’t understand the world around us, and they are so central
to modern science and technology that for more than a century they’ve become
part of the basic vocabulary, like whole numbers.

If you’ve never learned to think in multiple dimensions, you’ve missed out

on one of the great joys of life. It’s like you’ve never seen the ocean, or never
eaten chocolate.

## The Fruit of Your Imagination

When you do geometry in two or three dimensions, there’s an easy way to

show what you’re talking about: make a drawing. For example, in a threedimensional space, you can put together twenty equilateral triangles to make a
twenty-sided die that looks like that pictured in the figure.

This remarkable object, which has been known for ages, is called a _regular_

_icosahedron._ Looking at the drawing, you have the impression of seeing an
icosahedron floating in space. But that’s not really what’s in front of your eyes.
What you’re looking at is a two-dimensional page on which is found the image
of an icosahedron. More precisely, this image is what is called a _projection:_ it’s
the shadow (in two dimensions) of an imaginary icosahedron (in three
dimensions).


-----

Your mind easily reconstructs three-dimensional things from their two-

dimensional projections. When you look at your vacation photos, you have the
sense of actually seeing scenes that occur in three dimensions. It doesn’t require
any particular effort. It doesn’t tire you out or raise any metaphysical concerns.
You never believe that the scenes are actually taking place in two dimensions.
You never get the impression that your three-dimensional perception is nothing
but an abstraction, a mental reconstruction that is simply the fruit of your
imagination. You never have the sense that what you see in the photos is a
hallucination.

Your mind can even see things the image doesn’t show. Looking at the

projection of the icosahedron, not only can you see it, but you can turn it around
in your head, even if that requires a bit of concentration. The actual drawing
stays perfectly still. But that doesn’t stop you from easily understanding what I
mean by “turning” the icosahedron in your head.

For example, if you turn the icosahedron a fifth of the way around its vertical

axis, you’ll find the same icosahedron you started with. Rotational invariance is
a well-known property of icosahedrons.

If I had simply defined a regular icosahedron as an abstract assemblage of

twenty equilateral triangles, without having given you the means to picture it,
you would have had a lot more difficulty understanding this rotational


-----

invariance. With the drawing, it’s a lot easier.

Visual intuition makes certain mathematical properties clear, that without the

mental image wouldn’t be clear at all. This is why transforming mathematical
definitions into mental images is so important. When you’re unable to imagine
mathematical objects, you have the sense that you don’t really understand them.
And you’d be right.

## Geometry for the Sightless

When you hear someone talk about four-dimensional geometry for the first

time, you ask yourself what this fourth dimension could be. Is it time?
Something else?

The right answer is that the fourth dimension is whatever you want it to be.
When you do geometry in two dimensions, on a plane, a point is determined

by two coordinates, generally called _x_ and _y,_ that represent exactly what you
want them to represent.

—When you look at a map, _x_ is generally the longitude and _y_ is the latitude.
—When you draw the façade of a building, _x_ is generally the length and _y_ the

height.

—When you represent the growth of a population of rabbits, _x_ is generally time

and _y_ the number of rabbits.


-----

In the same way, in a space with ten dimensions, a point is determined by ten

coordinates that are generally called x 1 , . . . , x 10 . If you want these coordinates to
represent something, it can be whatever you want.

If you wanted to describe the geographic expansion of an invasive

population of rabbits, you would need to think in four dimensions, since you’d
need four coordinates: _longitude, latitude, time,_ and _population density._

It’s correct to say that four-dimensional geometry is an abstraction. But it’s a

simple and natural one. Your mind can accept the fourth dimension and even
find it concrete, the same way that it accepts as concrete all those things that in
reality aren’t at all concrete. The _geographic expansion of an invasive_
_population of rabbits_ is an abstract notion. If it seems concrete, it’s because your
mind has already accepted the idea that the fourth dimension exists and that it’s
concrete.

Contrary to common belief, it’s never abstraction that makes math difficult

to understand. Abstraction is our universal mode of thinking. The words that we
use are all abstractions. Speaking, making sentences, is to manipulate and
assemble abstractions. In that respect, four-dimensional geometry isn’t any more
abstract than two-dimensional geometry. The problem with four-dimensional
geometry has nothing to do with abstraction. The problem is that it’s hard to
visualize and hard to draw.

Geometry courses on higher dimensions are geometry courses for the

sightless. They resemble the theory of touch discussed in the previous chapter:
instead of relying on visual cues, they use mathematical language and formalism
to define a geometric vocabulary whose meaning is very precise but whose
visual interpretation isn’t straightforward. Everything can be described using
formulas based on coordinates. For example, there is a formula that defines the
distance between two points from their coordinates.

At first, our minds aren’t used to this new vocabulary. We can’t give it an

intuitive visual meaning. This is why four-dimensional geometry can’t be taught
in the same way as two-dimensional geometry, where figures and direct visual
intuition play a central role.

For example, there’s a four-dimensional analogue to the icosahedron. It is a

die with 600 sides, insanely regular and even more beautiful than the
icosahedron. Or rather, you should say that this object is a “hyper-die” with 600
“hyper-sides.” These hyper-sides are three-dimensional objects that are _regular_
_tetrahedrons,_ that is, regular pyramids with a triangular base. Each hyper-side
has 4 sides that are equilateral triangles, along which it is attached to 4 other
hyper-sides. In total there are 600 hyper-sides, 1,200 sides, 720 edges (the sides


-----

of the triangles) and 120 vertices.

Are you having problems visualizing it? If it’s any help, I’m providing a

drawing.

The picture is the two-dimensional shadow of the four-dimensional hyper-

die (or rather _one of its shadows,_ since an object’s shadow changes according to
its orientation toward the direction of the light).

It would be agreeable to look at this image and, without any effort, see the

“hyper-icosahedron” floating in front of you, suspended in four-dimensional
space.

I’d also like to see it floating before my eyes. I’d like to grasp it at a glance

and perceive its multidimensional thickness. Sadly, that’s not what happens.

My mind isn’t capable of instantly and effortlessly constructing a mental

image of a four-dimensional object from its two-dimensional shadow. I do
manage to perceive the physical presence of the hyper-icosahedron, but I do it in


-----

a different way, without relying on the drawing.

## Truly False Images

In studying math, I quickly realized that I was just like everyone else, and I

didn’t know how to see higher-dimensional geometric objects the same way I
could in two or three dimensions.

But I also noticed another phenomenon, quite subtle and unexpected.
This phenomenon wasn’t anything special. It was going on behind the

scenes, in the background, and could easily have gone unnoticed. Maybe it had
been going on forever without my even noticing.

At any rate, it was only at this very moment, a few weeks before my

eighteenth birthday, as we had begun looking at higher-dimensional geometry,
that I became aware of it: the abstract geometric notions that I had been taught
evoked in me bizarre impressions that were more or less visual.

These impressions were very faint and their meaning was unclear. They were

fleeting mental images: confused, vague, and evanescent. They were also
unstable. Sometimes they were there, sometimes not. When they were there, the
images were always naïve. And what’s worse, they were always false.

It was as if my mind were trying to see higher-dimensional geometry by

cobbling together two- and three-dimensional mental images. The result was
ridiculously far off the mark. The images weren’t just a little false, like a circle
that’s drawn is false because it’s not perfectly round. My mental images were
_grotesquely_ false.

I was studying at Louis-le-Grand, the most prestigious preparatory school in

Paris. I was being taught serious math, the official mathematics with all its
axioms, definitions, propositions, theorems, proofs, symbols, and formulas. The
teaching was logical and structured. I was taught to write math rigorously and
precisely.

And yet, for some reason, my naïve intuition hadn’t entirely given up. It was

as if it was refusing to sink into irrelevance. It didn’t work at all and gave bizarre
results.

The designs in my head resembled preschool scribblings, like when I drew

people with their arms and legs attached directly to the head, without realizing I
was forgetting a significant part of the body. Or rather realizing, in a confused
and mixed-up manner, that I was forgetting something of importance, without
figuring out what it might have been. Something was wrong, I knew, it but I
couldn’t say what it was.


-----

I have this clear memory from when I was four or five. One day, I called on

the teacher to tell her there was an issue with my drawing. Something going’s on
here, but what? She replied that everything was fine, that my drawing was
actually very nice. I had the very distinct impression she was making fun of me.

I had no desire to replay this experience and raise my hand to say that I had a

problem because the images in my head were false. I had no desire to be
ridiculed in front of everyone. My reflex was to treat these false mental images
like parasitical thoughts that I had to get rid of.

If the secret of success in the preparatory class at Louis-le-Grand was to

think like a four-year-old and make scribbles in your head, everyone would be
onto it.

It made no sense to insist on seeing things simply and in images. It was time

to grow up and learn how to think logically, in an organized manner, using
complex and serious words. I needed to act like an adult.

## Bigger or Smaller Pipes

At the time, I still believed that logic helped you to think. I wasn’t myself

able to think logically, but I thought it was because something was wrong with
me. I believed that studying math would help me fix this issue, and that the first
step was to get rid of my naïve and false mental images.

But amid all these false images, amid these parasitical thoughts that I wanted

to get rid of, I was surprised to find one that was less false than the others.

When you study vector spaces, you also study the concepts of _linear maps,_

_kernel, rank, dimension,_ and _codimension._ Vector spaces are usually represented
by letters and linear maps by arrows connecting these letters. But when I chose
to picture vector spaces as bigger or smaller barrels (according to their
dimension) and linear maps as bigger or smaller pipes (according to their rank)
connecting those barrels, then all the exercises on these concepts suddenly
became obvious.

It wasn’t much. That was a tiny subject and there were plenty of other

exercises that I was unable to solve. But in this subject, not only was I able to
solve the exercises, they became as obvious to me as 1,000,000,000 – 1 =
999,999,999. They became so obvious that it seemed absurd that you’d even
have to ask, and even more absurd that there were people who didn’t know how
to solve them.

These barrels and pipes made my life simpler, but where did they come

from? Was that how you’re supposed to do it? What was going on in other


-----

people’s heads? How were they imagining mathematical concepts?

I remember looking perplexedly at my classmates, scrutinizing their faces to

look for signs of what was going on inside their heads.

I was shocked to find out I hadn’t the slightest idea.

## A Gigantic Problem

No one had told us what we were supposed to be doing inside our heads, and

that was becoming a gigantic problem.

I realized that there were two radically different ways of looking at the

instruction we were receiving, and that the two approaches were mutually
incompatible.

The first approach consists of treating mathematics as knowledge.

Mathematical statements are information that you have to ingest and be able to
recall. You have to learn the definitions, learn the theorems, learn the proofs.

The second approach consists of refusing to learn. It takes on math as a

sensory experience. The sole function of mathematical statements is to help you
generate mental images, and only these images will lead to comprehension.
Once you have the correct mental images, everything else becomes clear.

The two approaches are incompatible because they require opposite

mindsets. Learning by heart, accepting to believe what you don’t understand—
that only exists in the first approach. In the second approach, you look at what
you don’t understand with distrust and incredulity: “Really? This is supposed to
be true? No way! How’s that possible? How can I picture that?”

Until then, I had instinctively followed the second approach, and it had

worked rather well for me. In primary school, when the teacher explained what a
circle was, I knew beforehand how to picture circles in my head. It’s why math
had been so easy for me. School had taught me how to put words to things that
were already easy for me to picture more or less clearly.

But I was reaching the end of that road. I was now being introduced to

serious and profound things that I couldn’t understand and that my intuition was
incapable of visualizing. I was reaching the limits of my mental capacity. The
concept of these bigger or smaller pipes was perhaps my final valid intuition.
And even that was a matter of luck. With such naïve images, frankly, what more
could I expect?

And without being able to rely on my intuition, I was stuck. I didn’t have any

choice. The moment had come when I finally had to “learn.”

But I was well aware of the implications. Treating math as knowledge meant


-----

giving up the pleasure of understanding it, of feeling it come alive within me. It
meant giving up loving it.

## An Ear for Dissonance

To be honest, it wasn’t the first time math posed real difficulties for me.
It had already happened at the beginning of middle school, when we had to

use letters to designate numbers. “Let _n_ be a whole number.” But if _n_ was a
whole number, why not just say the number? Why all this mystery? Couldn’t
they just spit it out? I had the feeling of being left out of the game, of not
understanding anything, not being smart enough.

At the time, thankfully, this didn’t last long. After a few weeks, without any

conscious effort, I ended up accepting the idea that you could reason with letters,
that is, reason with numbers without knowing the actual number. I understood
that not knowing the actual number was in fact the whole point. Reasoning with
letters was a way of reasoning with all numbers at once. It was doing an infinite
number of computations with a finite number of words.

At Louis-le-Grand, however, things were going much faster, and the

situation looked unsurmountable. Each week there were ten new concepts to
learn and I had no idea how to arrange them in my head.

It was at this very moment, right before I turned eighteen, that I made the

most significant decision in my scientific career, and possibly of my entire life:
instead of ignoring my stupid ideas and parasitical thoughts, I decided to
embrace them. I chose to listen to them and take them seriously.

Of course, that didn’t mean taking them at face value. I knew perfectly well

that they were false. It was obvious. But since it was so obvious, was I able to
say _exactly_ in which way they were false?

Today, when I try to describe this intellectual method, I sum it up like this: I

began to listen to the dissonance between my intuition and logic. In chapter 11 ,
I’ll explain what that means in practical terms with an example that should speak
to you.

In hindsight, I’m amazed that I made this decision on my own, piecing things

together myself without anyone to tell me it was the right way of doing things.

I remember trying to speak about it with a friend, Xavier, who was in the

same class. My concerns were so far off from official math and what we were
being taught that I failed to express myself clearly. I didn’t have the right words
to talk about these issues. It took me decades to find a proper way to talk about
them.


-----

I had no reason to believe that this method would work and I wasn’t even

hoping that it would. It was just a childish experiment. I was carrying it out
through sheer curiosity, just to see, to find out exactly when and how it would
fall apart. I was expecting it to fail, because it seemed unthinkable that there was
a method for understanding math and we had been kept in the dark.

However, I soon found out that my approach worked. The more I thought

about my stupid ideas, the less stupid they became. The more I focused on my
parasitical thoughts, the clearer they became. The more I listened to the
dissonance between my intuition and logic, the more I was able to transcribe it in
words. My intuition was never perfect, but it kept progressing without any effort
on my part.

In the space of a few weeks, my way of studying was transformed. I began to

use class as a benchmark for my intuition. I tried to predict what the teacher was
going to say. Most of the time I got it wrong, but that let me figure out where my
intuition was already correct. The things I understood, I understood so well that I
could rely on them and concentrate on the others.

I kept going back to what I didn’t understand until I understood why I didn’t

understand it. And in the end that’s what allowed me to understand.

## Our Ordinary Intuition

As long as schools refuse to teach the human reality of mathematics, all

mathematicians will be self-taught.

Saying that math is a matter of intuition isn’t enough. You also have to

explain that this intuition is accessible and describe the ways that you can
develop it. Nothing is more intimidating than the myth that mathematical
intuition is something special that only a chosen few are endowed with.

Mathematical intuition is the same intuition we use every day, but developed

and solidified by its confrontation with language and logic. It’s what our
intuition becomes once we stop believing it’s a gift from heaven, and instead
work on improving it.

Math often feels like gardening. You weed, plant, prune, water. It seems at

first that nothing is growing, yet one day you realize that it has. It’s hard to
believe that you can start with our common perception of space and develop it so
that it becomes instinctive to think in whatever dimension. However, that’s the
case.

Behind our false beliefs about mathematical intelligence, behind our

superstitions and inhibitions, there lies our ignorance about mental plasticity and


-----

the laws that govern it. We’ll come back to that in the next chapter.

Why math education consistently misses that point remains a mystery to me.

It’s as if teachers felt they’re not qualified to talk about it. Very few people dare
to describe their intuition in simple language and admit to the great naïveté of
their mental images.

Nevertheless, some of the greatest mathematicians have done so with

disconcerting tranquility. Pierre Deligne is a striking example. The most
successful of Grothendieck’s students and himself an extraordinary
mathematician (Grothendieck used to say of Deligne that “he’s better than me”),
Deligne won the Fields Medal in 1978 (for solving the famous Weil conjectures)
and the Abel Prize in 2013.

In his 2013 Abel Prize interview, Deligne was asked about his working style.

That was the occasion to talk about his intuition and his perception of higherdimensional geometry. Here, among other things, is what he said:

It’s important to be able to guess what is true, what is false. . . .

Then I don’t remember statements which are proved. I try to have a collection of pictures in my

mind. More than one picture, all false but in different ways, and I know in which way they are
false. . . .

The pictures are very simple. I draw just in my mind something like a circle in the plane and a

moving line which sweeps it, but then I know that this is false, that it’s not one-dimensional but
higher dimensional. . . .

It’s always very simple pictures, put together.

Mathematical intuition is so banal, simple, and stupid, that you need a lot of

self-confidence not to throw it in the trash. When you’re no longer a child, you
have only one wish, and that’s to reduce your false intuitions to silence. That’s
what almost happened to me when I thought I had to get rid of my stupid ideas
and parasitical thoughts.

The shy little voice that’s telling you that you don’t understand, that’s your

mathematical intuition. Don’t confuse it with the loud noisy voice that’s telling
you that you’re not smart enough. The little voice will guide you. That’s the one
you need to lend an ear to. That’s the one you need to take care of, and protect
throughout your entire life.

## 10
 The Art of Seeing

When I think about higher-dimensional geometric objects, I have a clear

enough visual perception. But I don’t see them in the same way I see objects in
the physical world. I really only see certain aspects, certain pieces, the details
that interest me. I’m not really able to see them entirely. But I sense their
presence in a diffuse way, with my entire body.

Being able to see in four or five dimensions in the same way we see in three

dimensions is said to be impossible.

Nevertheless, Bill Thurston could do it. This amazing ability is exceedingly

rare. It elicits admiration, even among the mathematical community, where it
contributed to his legend.

It’s natural to find that intimidating. It’s tempting to see in it the proof that

the great mathematicians are different, with a brain that is biologically superior
to our own. However, when you get to know Thurston’s personal history, you
realize that this hypothesis of an extraordinary gift doesn’t hold. His story isn’t
that of an alien endowed at birth with the extraordinary ability to see the world
in five dimensions.

In fact it’s rather the opposite. His story is that of a young boy born with a

handicap that during the first years of his life kept him from seeing the world in
three dimensions.

Thurston was born with a strong congenital strabismus, or squint. The visual

fields of his two eyes never met. When he looked at an object, he could see it
with only one eye at a time. The two images couldn’t come together, which
deprived him of any direct perception of depth.


-----

He was fortunate to have a generous and loving mother, who from the time

he was born devoted a lot of time and energy to help him overcome his
handicap. When Bill was two years old she worked with him for hours, showing
him special books filled with colors and designs, pretexts for long exercises of
reeducation.

Thurston’s almost carnal love for geometry, a love that would continue

throughout his life, traces back to this period. This love of space, materials,
textures, and forms underpins the entirety of his work and is reflected in the
marvelous drawings that illustrate his manuscripts.

When he began primary school, Thurston resolved to work each day to

expand his capacity for visualization. Very early in his life, without knowing it,
he became an extraordinary mathematician.

It would be a mistake to believe that he spent more time than other children

learning how to see. Every second we have our eyes open, as we observe the
world around us, we’re building on our capacity for visualization. Learning to
see is one of the main activities of the first years of our lives (and not only the
first years). But for the vast majority of children it’s an unconscious activity. It
happens continually, in the background, almost unintentionally, and without
much concentration.

Thurston didn’t have this luxury. He couldn’t simply let nature take its


-----

course. For him, there was nothing instinctive about seeing the world. Learning
to see was a conscious project. You could even say it became the work of a
lifetime.

Fosbury wasn’t able to jump like others so he had to invent his own way of

jumping. Thurston wasn’t able to see like others so he had to invent his own way
of seeing. Fosbury’s approach allowed him to jump higher. Deliberately working
to see better, as Thurston did, allows you to see further, more distinctly, down to
the heart of things.

When we believe we’re directly seeing the world in three dimensions, we’re

unconsciously piecing together the two-dimensional images captured by our
retinas. This way of perceiving space is imperfect. It’s not an objective
perception but a subjective one, relative to the place we’re looking from and
distorted by the effect of perspective. What’s worse, from our local perspective,
the greater part of the world is hidden to us.

Thurston was denied this easy access to three-dimensional perception. He

worked to construct his own, in his own way, through the power of thought. If
Thurston had a gift, it was that of patience and determination. Or perhaps that of
love and self-confidence.

Mathematical work isn’t a series of lightning insights and strokes of genius.

It’s first of all a work of reeducation based on the repetition of the same
exercises of imagination.

Progress is slow because the body needs time to transform itself. It doesn’t

help to force it, which may end up hurting you. You just need to commit to a
regular training schedule, keep your cool, keep going even when it seems you’re
not making any progress. It’s like going to the speech or physical therapist,
except you’re all alone and inside your head.

## Seeing Further

Thurston consciously and conscientiously developed his ability to picture the

world. Through persistence, by working to stitch together two-dimensional
images in his head, he was able to learn to see in three dimensions.

But why stop there? He realized that with the same technique he could go

even further. By putting together images in three dimensions, he learned how to
see in four. And by putting together images in four dimensions, he learned how
to see in five.

Even in only three dimensions, Thurston’s approach made him able to see

things no one had seen before. His geometrization conjecture, formulated in


-----

1982, deals precisely with the third dimension. A conjecture is a mathematical
statement that someone believes is valid but isn’t yet able to prove. Making a
conjecture is feeling something is right without being able to say why. It is by
nature a visionary and intuitive act.

Thurston’s conjecture was a spectacular breakthrough. It notably

encompassed the famous Poincaré conjecture, which had been formulated in
1904 and remained unsolved for so long that it was designated a “Millennium
Prize Problem” in a list established in 2000 of seven mathematical problems
judged the most profound and difficult, each with a million-dollar award for its
solution.

In 2003 Grisha Perelman was able to prove Thurston’s conjecture. He was

thus also able to solve Poincaré’s conjecture. We’ll talk more about Perelman
and the million dollars in chapter 17 .

## Seeing Is Believing

When Thurston claimed to see in four or five dimensions, what did he mean?

What was he seeing exactly, and in what sense should we understand his use of
the verb _to see?_

The best way to answer these questions is to turn them around. What exactly

do _we_ see? What do _we_ mean by “see”?

In using the verb _to see_ for ourselves, we have the tendency to overestimate

its meaning. When we look around us, we have the illusion of a direct relation to
the world, as if our eyes were magic windows drilled directly into our
consciousness and giving us direct access to reality. If that’s the meaning we
want to give to the verb _to see,_ then we have to be ready to face the
consequences: in this case, we never really _see_ anything, we just _believe_ that we
do.

What you see is never really unvarnished reality but an interpretation of the

world. In other words, it’s a reconstruction, produced by your memory and
imagination, based on raw visual signals that you’re never directly aware of. The
day you were born, you didn’t yet know how to see, because your brain hadn’t
yet learned to give a sense to the raw information delivered by your optic nerves.

This same ability for reconstruction allows you now to imagine things that

don’t exist, and to have the impression of seeing them. Seeing something and
imagining seeing it aren’t that different. You can imagine seeing an ant as big as
a horse, right there, before your eyes. You can picture it, describe it, and even
say a lot of things about it. But others have no means of directly seeing the giant


-----

ant in your head.

It’s the same with colors. Red gives you a very particular sensation. But what

exactly is the sensation of red in your head? How do you know it’s the same as
mine? Maybe that question itself makes no sense.

## Dalton and His Geranium

We have such a hard time describing and communicating our visual

sensations that it wasn’t until the autumn of 1792 that someone realized that we
aren’t all equal in the biological perception of colors: around 8 percent of men
(and 0.6 percent of women) are color-blind.

How is it that such a striking and easily shown fact could remain unknown

for thousands of years, from time immemorial when our ancestors began to
speak of color?

It was John Dalton, the great physicist to whom we owe the modern idea that

matter is composed of atoms, who made the discovery based on his own case.
He revealed his findings in a scientific communication whose sensationalist title
betrays his own personal stupefaction: “Extraordinary Facts relating to the
Vision of Colors.”

Dalton seems almost as astounded as if he had been the first to discover that

there were right-handed and left-handed people. But when you read his account,
you understand the mechanism that allowed this misunderstanding to persist for
millennia.

From the point of view of modern science, the story is simple enough. Our

perception of colors is explained by the presence within our retinas of dedicated
cells called _cones._ A human eye normally has three types of cones, sensitive
respectively to blue, green, and red light. We perceive a large palette of nuances
of colors, but only through their relative proportion of blue, green, and red. (It’s
for this simple reason that screens combine these three colors in each pixel.)
Dalton was a carrier of a genetic mutation. He only had two types of cones. He
was missing the cones sensitive to green light, which kept him from perceiving
certain nuances. For example, he found it hard to distinguish blue from pink. But
Dalton grew up in a world where no one imagined that was possible, so he
learned more or less how to name all the colors that others saw and talked about.
He convinced himself he was really seeing them. He saw the world in color,
without ever suspecting that he was missing something.

However, when told from Dalton’s point of view, before words were

invented that allowed for its scientific explanation, his story reads like an


-----

absurdist comedy.

Dalton begins his account with a confession: all his life, he’d had the

impression that the names of colors weren’t well chosen. When people
sometimes used the word _red_ instead of _pink,_ Dalton found it absurd. Pink, for
him, looked more like blue, nothing at all like red. But he never dared to tell
anyone.

In 1790, Dalton began to get interested in botany. He had a hard time

recognizing the colors of flowers but that didn’t surprise him too much. He
simply got help. When he asked people whether a flower was blue or pink, he
saw in their eyes that they thought this had to be some kind of prank. He didn’t
understand why they looked puzzled, but never took the time to find out. He was
already accustomed to the strangeness in all conversations about color. The
misunderstanding could have gone on forever if Dalton hadn’t made the
discovery, in the autumn of 1792, of a geranium with absolutely extraordinary
properties.

This geranium was said to be pink. However, in sunlight, it looked blue. So

far, nothing unusual: for Dalton, those two colors were always very close. But
when Dalton had the idea to look at it by candlelight, the geranium turned bright
red, a color that for him had nothing to do with pink.

Dalton was so flabbergasted that he brought his friends over to admire his

miraculous geranium. When his friends told him that his geranium was nothing
special, he was crestfallen. The only person who seemed to understand was his
own brother. That was the starting point for Dalton’s experiments on the
perception of colors that allowed him to demonstrate color blindness (sometimes
called _Daltonism_ ) and its hereditary character.

There are three morals to this “extraordinary” story.
The first is this: between raw perception and what we believe we see, there’s

a lot of room for maneuver. Dalton found the names of colors strange but that
didn’t keep him from accepting them and interpreting them in his own way. He
constructed his own color scale, different from non-color-blind people’s, but not
necessarily more impoverished. The most striking example was his hypersensitivity to the nuances separating pink and red. He saw these nuances more
intensely than a non-color-blind person, like a sightless person who develops a
hyper-sensitivity to touch and sound (we’ll come back to this in a few pages).

The second moral concerns the process of scientific discovery. Dalton’s

strength wasn’t an enormous power of reasoning, but an ability to feel that
something wasn’t right and not to stop searching until he’d found out what it
was. Before it became a great scientific discovery, it was just a weird feeling.


-----

For tens of thousands of years, billions of color-blind people had experienced the
same weird feeling without being able to put words to it.

And that’s the third moral. We can peacefully coexist with people who don’t

see the same things as us, without ever becoming aware of the differences. The
explanation is simple: we don’t see inside their heads, and, literally, we don’t see
what they see.

When Dalton said that blue resembled pink, non-Daltonians didn’t take him

seriously. When Thurston said he saw in five dimensions, non-Thurstonians
found it hard to believe.

There’s an easy way to make sure that color-blind people aren’t making fun

of you (or, if you are color-blind, that non-color-blind people aren’t making fun
of you): the Ishihara test, which uses images formed of small circles of different
colors. You see something different in the images, depending on whether you
perceive that certain circles are or aren’t the same color. In one of the plates in
the test, color-blind people clearly see the number 21, whereas others clearly see
74.

There’s no Ishihara test for the imagination. There’s no direct way to verify

that someone knows how to visualize the fifth dimension.

I don’t know what Thurston really saw, but when I look at his mathematical

work, I haven’t the slightest doubt that he saw many things I don’t. His style of
writing gives the impression that he’s just trying to share them with us. He’d
love to show the things directly, in real life, but he knows that’s impossible. So
he writes math papers.

## Seeing Is Finding Something Evident

In an interview with the _New York Times,_ Thurston summed up things as

follows: “People don’t understand how I can visualize in four or five
dimensions. Five-dimensional shapes are hard to visualize—but it doesn’t mean
you can’t think about them. Thinking is really the same as seeing.”

The last sentence, however, warrants some clarification. In the next chapter

we’ll discuss the nuance between a rapid and intuitive way of thinking, and a
slow and reflective way. For a mathematician, “seeing” signifies thinking in a
rapid and intuitive manner, directly, without need for reflection, as if the object
really existed, as if it were right there in front of you.

Ease of access and immediacy count more than the visual nature of

perception. Seeing is finding something evident. It’s true etymologically
(“evident” comes from the latin _videre,_ which means “to see”) and it’s also true


-----

in everyday life: when you look at a block of ice, it’s evident that it’s cold,
although you can’t directly see its temperature.

## An Ear for the World

Ben Underwood was born in California in 1992. When he was only two

years old his mother saw a strange reflection in the back of one of his eyes. It
was retinal cancer. When he was three, he had to undergo an operation to
remove both his eyes. Sometimes people use the term “visually impaired” as a
polite euphemism. In Ben Underwood’s case, it’s useless to hide behind a
euphemism. He was blind.

When he was seven, Ben discovered he had a magic power: by clicking his

tongue, he was able to see the world around him.

Real magic doesn’t exist. Ben Underwood had simply learned to see by

echolocation, like bats or dolphins. Clicks are sonar signals. Every object sends
back a characteristic echo that tells you about its location, size, form, and what
it’s made of.

We already know that echoes can inform us about the space around us. To

tell the difference between your bathroom and the inside of a cathedral, you just
have to listen. And maybe you’ve already had the fascinating experience of
waking up one morning and knowing, without even having opened your eyes,
that it snowed during the night, because the texture of the silence has changed.

What we have a much harder time believing is that it’s really possible, using

only your ears, to reconstruct a reliable and detailed image of the world that
surrounds us. It is, however, what Ben Underwood was able to do.


-----

Without anyone explaining how to do it, without anyone even telling him it

was possible, he developed a genuine faculty of “vision.” Videos show him
moving about freely, without using a cane or touching things. He does all the
actions of daily life: going up and down stairs, opening doors, naming objects in
front of him without picking them up, walking in the street, pointing at trees and
their branches, riding a bike, roller-skating, weaving around cars, playing
basketball.

Ben Underwood isn’t the first sightless person to develop echolocation. The

phenomenon has been known and documented for nearly three hundred years.
But no one before him had brought it to this high a degree of perfection.

Ben Underwood shattered the limits of what was believed humanly possible.

His abilities made him famous among the scientific community as well as the
general public. As a teenager, he was invited on _The Oprah Winfrey Show_ to
share his story.

What might he have accomplished had he been able to pursue the

development of his technique and continued to share his secrets? We’ll never
know. Ben Underwood died at age sixteen due to a recurrence of the cancer that
had taken his sight.

## The Laws of Mental Plasticity

Bill Thurston and Ben Underwood are striking geniuses. But what exactly is

a genius? Is it a question of intelligence? Curiosity? Courage? Willpower?

I deeply admire both Thurston and Underwood, but it’s not only to share my

admiration that I’m telling their stories.

The real subject is our unfounded beliefs about the functioning of our brain.

It’s our illusion of being able to directly access the “real” world independently of
the representation that our brain constructs of it. By ignoring the enormous range
of possibilities available to us, we assign absurd limits to our intelligence. Ben
Underwood’s story is so hard to believe that we have the reflex to check on the
internet that it’s not some urban legend. That just gives a small idea of the
fabulous experiences we deny ourselves.

The glaring omission of our culture and of our education is to teach us about

our extraordinary mental plasticity, and that our destiny depends in great part on
what we choose to do with it. The failure of math education is simply collateral
damage of this omission. Those who don’t have the chance to accidentally
rediscover the actions that use this plasticity in the service of mathematics are
condemned never to understand it.


-----

Our general ignorance of the basic principles of mental plasticity is an

enormous waste that reaches far beyond mathematics. Without pretending to
know or understand everything, here are what seem to me the essential points:

1. _The power of our mental plasticity is profoundly shocking and almost_

_supernatural._

Stories like those of Bill Thurston and Ben Underwood are always hard to

believe. They’re amazing, but have a hint of sensationalism that’s hard to shake
off. You ask yourself what’s the gimmick. But there isn’t any gimmick. From a
biological point of view, all of this is normal.

Our disbelief has a simple explanation, one that stems from the unconscious

nature of the mechanisms at work. When someone tells us that Ben Underwood
sees the world by analyzing the echoes of his clicks, we imagine him solving
complex mathematical equations beyond the reach of a normal human being.
That’s both true and false. If you took a piece of paper and tried to solve the
equations that govern the reflection of sound waves, you couldn’t do it fast
enough to see the world around you. It isn’t believable that Ben Underwood
could do the calculations in his head.

No human is capable of solving these equations in the way that school

teaches us to solve equations, by applying a conscious and mechanical method.
But the specificity of our mental plasticity is to give us an unconscious means of
solving problems without ever stating them, by training our minds to recognize a
multitude of subtle patterns that evade our consciousness.

No mathematician solves problems the way you’re taught in school. It’s

biologically impossible to create truly innovative mathematics by following this
method, just as it’s biologically impossible to learn how to walk by solving
Newton’s equations.

How do you think you learned how to see, to walk, to talk, if it wasn’t by a

process that you weren’t entirely aware of?

If you judged your own fundamental learning experiences using the same

criteria that make you doubt the possibility of visualizing the fifth dimension or
seeing the world by making clicks with your tongue, you would come to the
same incredulous conclusion: rationally, learning to see, to walk, or to talk
seems impossible. And yet you’ve managed to do it.

2. _The starting point is always insignificant._
Try doing this: close your eyes and ask someone to place the palm of their

hand directly in front of your face, then take it away and put it back without


-----

telling you while you make clicks with your tongue. You can hear the presence
of the hand, just as you can hear the presence of a wall if you’re within a few
inches of it.

Starting with this primitive ability that you already have in a rudimentary

state, you’re free to develop your own ability for echolocation. It takes a kind of
genius to dream it up yourself, but it’s not the same thing once you know it’s
possible. Someone can even teach it to you, like Daniel Kish (sightless since
early childhood, he, like Ben Underwood, invented his own technique of
echolocation and teaches it today to young sightless people).

You have the same magic abilities as anyone else. It’s just a question of will,

patience, and openness to the world.

3. _Progress is slow and almost imperceptible._
Mental plasticity is by nature a slow and invisible phenomenon whose

progress is impossible to perceive in real time. It gradually transforms us, so
gradually that, at first, we don’t notice anything. At some point, however, we
take notice, and it usually comes as a shock, precisely because we didn’t see it
coming. It happened unwittingly, in the background, without any effort on our
part.

As for echolocation, it seems that you can get significant results by working

an hour per day for two to three weeks. In the end, it’s a bit like learning how to
drive.

When you want to learn a new sport, a new language, or a new job, you go

through a similar process. You have to throw yourself into it and accept that
you’ll be feeling about for a bit, thinking that you’ll never be any good, until the
moment you find, as if by magic, that you’re getting the hang of it.

## The Perfect Recipe for Discouragement

As a teenager, when my cousin Jerome bought a skateboard, I was shocked:

“Why did he buy a skateboard when he doesn’t know how to use it?” When he
first got on it, he fell. Seen from outside, a person learning how to skateboard is
just someone who spends all their time falling off it. Except that after a bit, as if
by magic, Jerome was able to do it. Then it was more than just shocking. It had
become unfair, scandalous, as if incompetence had been rewarded.

As long as you ignore the laws of mental plasticity, you underestimate

others, and you underestimate yourself. The essence of mental plasticity is to
transform audacity into competence.


-----

The process is slow and invisible, and at first success seems unachievable:

that’s the biological reality of our learning mechanisms.

By an unfortunate coincidence, that’s also the perfect recipe for

discouragement. You need a lot of self-control and self-confidence to commit to
a process that’s confusing, slow, and uncertain.

That’s why we so often limit ourselves to learning only what’s officially

possible to learn (things that have introductory or professional development
courses), what you can learn by imitating others, or what comes naturally.

The rest, the secret and invisible apprenticeships, are said to be “gifts,”

“talents,” “supernatural powers.” No one tells us that we can learn to see in five
dimensions, get our bearings through echolocation, or tell the sex of dogs and
cats by looking at their heads, so we never even try.

We go so far as to fail to notice the “magic” powers that we develop without

our knowing it: detecting insincerity in a smile or the sound of a voice,
recognizing people we love through their particular scent, or knowing what they
will say before they even say it. People who aren’t good at math even forget that
the video games they master in a matter of hours are cognitively a hundred times
more difficult than high school math classes.

Reconnecting with your early childhood capacity for learning means to stop

believing in these absurd stories of gifts and talent. It means to become once
again capable of devoting ten or twenty hours to something that may or may not
be impossible, without being distracted by the feeling of your own uselessness. It
means to rediscover the world with an open mind, trying something just to see
what happens, for fun, because you want to.

Ten or twenty hours doesn’t seem like much. Seeing by echolocation sounds

like a cool idea. If it only takes twenty hours, it seems worth the price. However,
to spend twenty hours at something, you have to really want to do it.

Ten or twenty hours of real exploration, outside of our comfort zone, is

enough to discover within ourselves unsuspected powers. But how many times
lately have you spent ten or twenty hours at something entirely new?

## The Great Hacking Project

When I was twenty-five, about one year before completing my PhD, I started

looking at math as a pure activity of mental reprogramming, and I made the
assumption that my mental plasticity had no limits.

Or, to speak more frankly, I chose at age twenty-five to throw myself into the

deliberate and systematic project of hacking my cognitive abilities.


-----

My basic technique hadn’t changed: _lending an ear to the dissonance_

_between my intuition and logic._ This technique remained my instrument for
exploring the world, just like Ben Underwood’s tongue clicks.

What changed at this moment of my life were my belief systems and the

mindset that ensued. I stopped believing that our way of seeing and thinking
about the world was a given fact, and that we each had a predefined amount of
intelligence that we had to make do with. In place of that, I began to believe that
we had the freedom to ceaselessly refashion our way of seeing and thinking, and
to _construct our own intelligence_ day after day.

In chapter 16 I’ll talk about some of the increasingly extreme visualization

exercises that allowed me to follow this path.

This change of approach had one initial practical consequence: I became a

creative mathematician. I began to have ideas no one had had before, to see
things no one had seen before, to prove theorems no one had yet proven—at first
easy theorems, and later in my career theorems that had till then seemed far
beyond my capabilities. Mathematical creativity has the reputation of being a
great mystery that science can’t explain. In my experience, however, it emerged
as a natural phenomenon once I had adopted the correct psychological attitude.

But the greatest effect of this new approach was in my personal life. If I was

able to hack my visual cortex and modify my way of perceiving space, if I was
capable of changing even my way of understanding the notion of truth, what
about all the rest? What about, for example, all that I’d believed were givens in
my life, these “strengths” and these “weaknesses” that people spoke about and
made up my so-called “personality”? What about my shyness, my mental blocks,
my insecurities, and everything that was supposed to be holding me back? What
about my social identity? How could these things be any less adaptable, less
malleable, less freely reprogrammable than my perception of space and truth?

I remember with delight this beautiful day when, the very moment I stepped

out into the street, I convinced myself that these things couldn’t be fixed and
determined, that they were necessarily open to reconfiguration, and that it was
up to me to try.

Believing that you have a fixed personality, I thought to myself, is nothing

but a superstition.

 The Ball and the Bat

A ball and a bat cost a total of $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball.

How much does the ball cost?

This problem is taken from _Thinking, Fast and Slow,_ the best-selling book by

the psychologist Daniel Kahneman, winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in
Economics for his work on cognitive biases.

I encourage you to try the test with your friends. It works nearly all the time:

most people answer that the ball costs 10¢. But that’s not the right answer. If the
ball cost 10¢, the bat would cost $1.10 (since it costs $1 more than the ball), and
the ball and the bat together would cost $1.20.

If you explain why their answer is wrong, your friends will get it easily

enough. But they won’t necessarily know the right answer. They’ll even find a
lot of excuses: it’s hard to do the calculations, they’d have to write down the
equations but they don’t have a pen, they can’t be bothered. . . .

The correct answer is 5¢. If the ball costs 5¢, the bat costs $1.05, and

together they cost $1.10.

The ball and bat problem plays a prominent role in Kahneman’s book

because it’s the perfect illustration of his theory. According to him, we have two
distinct cognitive systems, which he calls _System 1_ and _System 2._

System 1 allows you to give immediate and instinctive responses, without

even trying. When someone asks you how much is 2 + 2, what year you were
born, which weighs more, an elephant or a mouse, you don’t even have to think.
But it’s also System 1 that makes you answer, incorrectly, that the ball costs 10¢.

System 2 is what you have to use when you’re asked to calculate 47 × 83, or

how many days have passed since your birth. You know how to get the answer,
but you’d have to think. You probably need pencil and paper. One thing is
certain: you don’t really want to do it. Even if System 2 is more reliable and
rigorous, you only use it when you have no other choice, because thinking hard,


-----

doing calculations, and logical reasoning are all tiresome.

Kahneman’s theory can be summed up as follows:

1. Each time our System 1 gives us an answer, we’re tempted to use it without

calling on System 2, not even to verify that the answer is correct. Because
System 2 uses a lot of mental energy and resources, we primarily rely on our
instinct. Biologically, we’ve developed a preference for intellectual laziness.

2. In certain situations, our System 1 is systematically wrong. We all make the

same mistakes, all the time, as if the wiring schematic in our brain was
defective. These are the “cognitive biases” that Kahneman and his school have
set out to study. We all want to say that the ball costs 10¢.

Kahneman’s book became a best seller in part because it went beyond the

simple theoretical observation and proposed a concrete method to avoid falling
into the trap.

He has a simple recommendation: learn the list of cognitive biases presented

in his book by heart, and each time you recognize one of the typical situations,
fight your inclination and use your System 2 while trying to ignore your System
1.

I think I have a better way of doing it, which I’ll explain.

## “That’s cheating!”

The first time I heard the story of the ball and the bat, it was from a friend

who was studying cognitive science at Princeton. She had just read Kahneman’s
book and wanted to do the test with me.

Like most people, I gave an instinctive response. I listened to my System 1

without knowing it was called _System 1._ Without thinking, without doing any
calculations, I gave the first answer that popped into my head: “5¢.”

I felt that my answer annoyed my friend but I didn’t immediately know why.

She took the time to explain what was up. I was supposed to answer “10¢,” or at
least take a few seconds before answering “5¢.” At any rate, there was no way I
was supposed to answer “5¢” immediately, without taking the time to think
about it. That was simply not allowed. A guy had even won the Nobel Prize for
showing it was impossible.

Quickly enough, right before changing the topic of conversation, my friend

did however come up with an explanation—a simple, pragmatic, and not entirely
false one: “That’s cheating! You’re a mathematician!”


-----

When I had my friends and colleagues take the test, I was sincerely surprised

to find that so many of them answered “10¢,” and even more surprised at their
difficulty in finding the right answer after admitting that their initial response
was wrong. The most incredible thing was that everyone spoke to me about
“doing the calculations,” as if it weren’t visually evident that the right answer
was “5¢.”

I was like Dalton with his magic geranium, except that instead of being the

one with the missing cones, I was the one seeing more colors than my friends.
The other difference with Dalton, of course, is that the explanation doesn’t have
anything to do with genetics.

At the end of this chapter, I’ll explain what I did to see the right answer—

and how you can learn to do it as well.

## A or B

This story about the ball and the bat really began to intrigue me, and I tried

to understand what was stopping my friends from seeing the right answer when
it was so obvious.

A bit like Dalton, I began my little inquiry. I believe I’ve found an

explanation. After asking my friends about the price of the ball, I followed up
with this question:

Imagine that you have to make an important decision in your life. You have the choice between
option A and option B. Your intuition tells you to choose A, but your reason tells you to choose B.
What do you do?

I presented this question to more than a dozen of my nonmathematician

friends, and almost all of them answered, without hesitation, that they’d follow
their intuition and choose A. Only one person chose B. Another hesitated for a
long time, without ever giving a clear response.

Nothing guarantees that you’d get such a high percentage of people choosing

A if you tried this experiment on your own. My protocol suffers from what is
called _selection bias,_ in that my friends aren’t necessarily representative of the
general population, and it may very well be that people who listen to their
intuition have greater chances of becoming my friends.

The exact proportion of A and B didn’t really interest me. What I wanted to

know was whether someone would come up with the same response I would
have given myself. No one did.

My hypothesis is that my unusual response to the question is the key that


-----

allowed me to become good at math and, along the way, to reeducate many of
my cognitive biases.

## An Unreasonable Assumption

Kahneman says that thousands of American students took the ball and bat

test, and that “the results are shocking.” At the lower-tier universities, the error
rate was over 80 percent. Even students at Harvard, MIT, and Princeton gave the
wrong answer more than 50 percent of the time.

Kahneman’s book is fascinating, but I’m confused whenever I see him

opposing “the right answer” and “the intuitive answer,” as if there were only one
intuitive response possible, and it was necessarily false. For example, he writes:
“It is safe to assume that the intuitive answer also came to the mind of those who
ended up with the correct number—they somehow managed to resist the
intuition.”

In other words, Kahneman finds it safe to assume that I shouldn’t exist. My

opinion, understandably, is that this isn’t a reasonable assumption.

But beyond the relatively minor question of my own existence, this anecdote

reveals a major disconnect between Kahneman’s theory and what all
mathematicians know deep in their bones. It’s up to you to decide who’s in the
best position to give you advice on mental calculations.

Kahneman finds it shocking that 50 percent of the students at Harvard, MIT,

and Princeton blindly relied on a manifestly false intuition, and I’m as shocked
as he is.

But I’m equally shocked by something that Kahneman apparently finds

completely normal: how is it that 50 percent of the students at Harvard, MIT,
and Princeton managed to get accepted despite having such faulty intuitions?

Having studied and taught at highly competitive universities, I know that

students who can directly “see” the correct answer in their head have an
enormous competitive advantage. I don’t understand how the others can even
compete. I imagine that they compensate by intensive cramming, something I’m
completely incapable of and the very thought of which gives me a headache.

Kahneman’s advice consists of identifying the situations where we should

“resist” our intuition and submit ourselves to System 2. It’s strange advice
coming from someone who’s spent his life documenting our aversion to effort,
our preference for instinctive and immediate responses, our immoderate love for
System 1—and our hatred of System 2.

This idea that we should resist our bad instincts and entirely submit to a


-----

robotic mode of thought was once the prevalent paradigm in education.
Kahneman is well enough placed to know why it can’t work.

Another point bothers me. It’s true that we should be wary of our System 1.

But what are we to make of our System 2? Personally, I stopped trusting mine
after ninth grade, when I found out I wasn’t able to string together three lines of
calculations without making a mistake.

But the most troubling aspect is that Kahneman reasons as if our intuition

were hardwired, with no possibility for us to reconfigure or reprogram it. Had he
lived in the ancient Roman era, he would almost certainly have said that it was
impossible to represent mentally the result of the operation “1,000,000,000 – 1,”
because the number greatly exceeded the capacities of human intuition.

## System 3

When I need to make an important decision in my life, if my intuition tells

me to choose option A and my reason tells me to choose option B, I tell myself
there’s something going on and I’m not ready to make the decision.

That’s the moment to resort to what I call _System 3._
System 3 is an assortment of introspection and meditation techniques aimed

at establishing a dialogue between intuition and rationality. You use it each time
you try to recall your dreams, to put words to the fleeting impression that left a
strange taste in your mouth, to sort out your most confused and contradictory
ideas.

When I was eighteen and I discovered that the stupid images in my head had

a tendency to correct themselves once I made the effort to describe and name
them, when I got into the habit of _lending an ear to the dissonance between my_
_intuition and logic,_ I put System 3 at the center of my strategy for learning math.
The results exceeded my wildest expectations.

We all know System 3 and we all use it, at least from time to time. My

mathematical journey taught me that a voluntary and radical use of System 3 is
not only possible, it augments our intuitive capacities well beyond the supposed
limits of human cognition.

Through the years, the systematic search for a better alignment between my

intuition and logic has become my way of understanding the world, others, and
even myself.

In practical terms, here’s what that means. When my intuition tells me A and

rationality tells me B, I put myself in the position of a referee. I force myself to
translate my intuition into words, to tell it like a simple and intelligible story.


-----

Vice versa, I try to picture what logical reasoning is actually expressing, to
experience it in my body, to hear what it’s trying to say. I ask myself if I really
believe it. I fumble about. It takes time but it’s not a real effort. It’s more like a
meditation on running water, something going on in the background that might
stop and start, then all of a sudden become clear days, months, or even years
later.

The goal is to understand where things are going wrong. Are my intuition

and logic even speaking the same language? Are they even talking about the
same things?

My intuition is never perfect. It’s often relevant, but sometimes it’s just

rubbish. The good news is that it’s generally fixable. As for logic, that’s never
wrong. At least officially. Except that it doesn’t necessarily say what I think it’s
saying.

In the end, it’s almost always my intuition that wins. When I force it to listen

to what logic is saying, it takes that into account and adjusts its position. Logic is
something inert, like a pebble. My intuition is organic, it is living and growing.

It’s obviously stupid to call this approach _System 3._ It should simply be

called _thinking_ or _reflecting._ But the meaning of these words has been hijacked
by a tradition that wants to make us believe that we should think contrary to our
intuition. We’re told that our intuition is the mortal enemy of reason, that any
dialogue between the two is impossible, and thinking means you have to submit
blindly to System 2.

I’m personally incapable of thinking against my intuition and I have serious

doubts as to the sincerity of people who claim they can.

In chapter 3 I said that your intuition was your most powerful intellectual

resource. However, at the risk of spoiling your dreams, I must be honest with
you: your intuition isn’t a magical elixir, or your lucky star, or the hand of God
on your shoulder. It’s much more trivial than that. It’s the tangible manifestation
of a reality that is invisible but perfectly concrete and material: the entanglement
of synaptic connections between your neurons that your brain continuously
constructs and reorganizes, as it has done since you were in the womb.

Your brain contains as many neurons as there are stars in the Milky Way.

Each of these neurons is, on average, tied to thousands of other neurons. This
fabric of hundreds of trillions of interconnections is the network of your mental
associations. Its structure is your way of giving meaning to the raw information
continually flooding into your brain. This is, literally, your vision of the world.
All that you have seen, heard, felt, imagined, or desired, all of your experience,
all that you know, all that you remember, is encoded in this web. When your


-----

intuition speaks, that’s where it’s speaking from.

Your intuition will always be more powerful and better informed than the

most sophisticated of language-based reasonings. For all that, it’s not infallible.
If your intuition tells you the ball costs 10¢, it’s plainly wrong.

My intuition isn’t any less fallible than yours. It’s always getting things

wrong. I have, however, learned never to be ashamed of it. I don’t disdain my
mistakes, I don’t push them aside, because I don’t think that they betray my
intellectual inferiority or some cognitive biases hardwired in my brain. On the
contrary. Nothing’s more exciting than a big glaring error: it’s always a sign that
I’m not looking at things in the right way, and that it’s possible to see them more
clearly. When I’m able to put my finger on an error in my intuition, I know it’s
good news, because it means that my mental representations are already in the
process of reconfiguring themselves.

My intuition has the mental age of a two-year-old—it has no inhibitions and

always wants to learn. If you stop mistreating your own, you’ll see that it’s
exactly like mine, only asking to be allowed to grow.

## The Price of a Ball

Because I have terrible handwriting, and because I’m easily distracted, I

have a tendency to make mistakes in calculations.

I discovered in ninth grade that the only way to get around that was to verify

after every three lines that what I was writing still made sense and that I really
believed it. In other words, I learned how to use my System 1 to supervise the
work of my System 2. From this time on, I was incapable of manipulating
mathematical objects that I had no intuition for.

At what moment did I stop primarily visualizing numbers through their

written form? I don’t recall. But it undoubtedly goes back to the same period.
Decimal writing of numbers is useful for written calculations but it is certainly
less practical when you want to form an intuitive idea about the validity of those
calculations. This is where System 1 has an edge: it isn’t bound by the
constraints of language and writing.

Depending on the context, I have many different ways of visualizing

numbers. I have, for example, a tendency to visualize price in terms of length.
When my friend told me that the ball and bat together cost $1.10, I immediately
translated her words into a mental image that looked something like this:


-----

When she told me that the bat cost $1 more than the ball, here’s how I saw it:

Then the two images came together in my head and morphed into something

like this:

If this is how you visualize the problem, it doesn’t take a genius to figure that

a ball costs 5¢.

A mental image is neither good nor bad in and of itself. Its value lies in what

it allows you to understand. There are countless ways to visualize the problem
and I don’t pretend that mine is better. My numeric intuition isn’t all that
remarkable. I wouldn’t be able to do the calculation if the ball and bat together
cost $2,734.18 and the bat cost $967.37 more than the ball.

I have these pictures in my head because, in my life, I’ve made a lot of

calculations errors. Instead of concluding that I was terrible at math, I simply


-----

looked for simpler ways to see things, to grasp what I was writing.

In time, with this approach, I constructed a great variety of mental images

that help me today to better understand the world.

If you want to learn to find it obvious that the ball costs 5¢, I recommend

proceeding like a mathematician would when faced with a new and
incomprehensible idea. Rather than learning my pictures by heart, train yourself
to construct pictures that work for you. The most important messages, the ones
you should always bear in mind, are these:

1. You can reprogram your intuition.
2. Any misalignment between your intuition and reason is an opportunity to

_create within yourself_ a new way of seeing things.

3. Don’t expect it all to come at once, in real time. Developing mental images

means reorganizing the connections between your neurons. This process is
organic and has its own pace.

4. Don’t force it. Simply start from what you already understand, what you can

already see, what you find easy, and just play with it. Try to intuitively
interpret the calculations you would have written down. If it helps, scribble on
a piece of paper.

5. With time and practice, this activity will strengthen your intuitive capacities.

It may not seem like you’re making progress, until the day the right answer
suddenly seems obvious.

You’ll need a number of training sessions. Exactly how many, I don’t know.

It’s not worth tiring yourself out—better to split it up into short five-minute
sessions, and think about it in the shower or while on a walk. Above all, take
your time. It’s good to think about it only once a week or once a month. Most
important, keep at it and don’t let it drop. It will come eventually.

Solving a problem is only ever a pretext. The important thing is that you

have the power to reeducate your intuition, to gain confidence in your body and
thoughts.

Nothing about this should surprise you. Solving the problem of the ball and

the bat is like standing up on a surfboard. Kahneman says that the first time you
stand up on a surfboard, you’ll fall in the water, and concludes that humans are
born with a defective sense of balance and that getting up on a surfboard can
never become intuitive. His advice is to get out of the water and learn the laws of
physics by heart. My advice is to get back up on the board.

## Electrical, Mechanical, Organic Thought

A central idea of this book is that our culture conveys false beliefs about how

our brain functions, and that these false beliefs keep people away from the
simple actions that would allow them to become good at math.

When you say to people that certain truths are by nature counterintuitive, you

tell them that they can never really understand. It’s a way of discouraging them.
Nothing is counterintuitive by nature: something is only ever counterintuitive
temporarily, until you’ve found means to make it intuitive.

Understanding something is making it intuitive for yourself. Explaining

something to others is proposing simple ways of making it intuitive.

None of this takes away from the value of Kahneman’s work. The cognitive

biases that he documents are striking human realities of great social importance.
We all have biases, even if they aren’t hard-coded and vary from one person to
another, and certain biases happen to be more widespread and problematic than
others.

The distinction Kahneman makes between System 1 and System 2 has the

merit of being simple. In a sense, it picks up the classic opposition between left
brain and right brain, but in a modern version, without the anatomical nonsense.
It’s just a basic model, but it’s appealing, and helps us become aware of our
different ways of mobilizing our mental resources.

We’ll end this chapter with a summary of the characteristic principles of

System 3, the big oversight in Kahneman’s theory. We’ll talk again in chapter 19
about the physical structure of our cortex and how it functions, which will allow
for a biological interpretation of System 3 and its efficacy. At any rate, System 3
is a good model for the real nature of mathematical work.

System 1 is our intuitive capacity. We all like to describe it using electrical

metaphors: with our intuition, we say that we think with _the speed of lightning._
It’s not entirely false. Our brain isn’t properly speaking an electrical circuit, but
the signal that’s transmitted along the neurons is electrical in nature.

System 2 is our capacity for rigorous reasoning. We imagine it in mechanical

terms, with gears or something of the sort. That doesn’t correspond to any
biological reality. What we are biologically capable of is to pretend we’re robots
and mechanically apply a preset series of instructions. With the right set of
instructions, we can make logical conclusions and valid calculations. But it’s so
disagreeable and against our nature that we usually give up after a few seconds,
or at most a few minutes. In the end we’re rather sorry robots: we make too
many mistakes and we can’t go the distance.

Metaphor Electrical Mechanical Organic

Limitations Imprecise and incoherent Not human Asynchronous

System 3 is so entirely ignored by our culture that I can’t find the right word

to characterize it. As I said above, I would like to say that System 3 simply
corresponds to our capacity for _thinking_ . But the verb _to think_ doesn’t mean
much since it’s been used as an injunction to submit to System 2.

The activity of System 3 is a special kind of _meditation_ , but this word is also

much too vague. Not all meditation is an activity of System 3. System 3
specifically aims at establishing a dialogue between Systems 1 and 2, in order to
understand their misalignments and resolve them. Rather than a free meditation,
it’s one constrained by the principle of noncontradiction. Its ultimate goal is to
revise and update System 1 while taking into account the results of System 2.

It’s also necessary to distinguish System 3 from the capacity of our System 1

to revise itself without any deliberate action on our part. Our mental plasticity
results from the constant reconfiguration of our synaptic network: our mental
circuits evolve in response to our experiences. You can imagine neurons as
minuscule plants that grow and sink their roots deeper and deeper.

Every time we practice a given activity we habituate our System 1 to the

specifics of that activity. When we try to stand up on a surfboard, we habituate
our System 1 to the hard realities of Newtonian physics and construct our surfing
instincts. With System 3, we habituate our System 1 to the hard realities of
logical consistency and construct our instincts for truth.

The great misunderstanding of math teaching stems from the fact that all the

tangible manifestations of mathematics—its confusing language, its
incomprehensible notation, its bizarre and rigid reasoning—seem to tie it to
System 2.

Most people take that at face value. They become discouraged in a few


-----

minutes, or throw themselves into a masochistic effort that has zero chance of
succeeding.

But a few people choose to rely on their System 3. They’re not aware that

they’re doing anything special. Math just feels easy to them. It doesn’t even feel
like work. They’re just seeing pictures in their heads, and spending a couple of
minutes a day looking at these pictures and asking themselves naïve questions.

To them, it all looks completely normal. It certainly doesn’t feel like they

have a gift.

## 12
 There Are No Tricks

It’s an ordinary day in the United States in the early 1950s. An ordinary

family is on an ordinary road. The father is driving; the two kids are in the
backseat. To stop them squabbling, the father asks them some puzzles:

What is 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + 100?

The younger boy is five years old. In a few seconds he answers “5,000.” The

father tells him that’s almost it. The young boy thinks for a few seconds more
and finally gives the right answer: “5,050.”

The five-year-old boy is Bill Thurston. The story makes you smile,

especially if you know the famous tale about Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855),
“the prince of mathematics.” Even if this old story is nothing but a legend, it’s
very well known, and Thurston’s father undoubtedly had heard about it.

Gauss was one of the greatest mathematicians in history, someone you could

without hesitation place alongside Thales, Pythagoras, Euclid, Archimedes, alKhwarizmi, Descartes, Euler, Newton, Leibniz, Riemann, Cantor, Poincaré, von
Neumann, Grothendieck, and a few others. He was so spectacularly brilliant and
creative that his contemporaries refused to believe that his intelligence came
from a biologically normal human brain. He was in a way the Albert Einstein of
his time.

And, in fact, it ended exactly as with Einstein. When Gauss died, someone

thought it wise to take his brain in the hope of uncovering its secrets. Two
centuries later, Gauss’s brain is still preciously conserved in a jar, somewhere in
the collections at the University of Göttingen. No one has of yet found anything
particularly interesting to say about it.

The legend has it that, at the prime age of seven, the young Gauss scared the

hell out of his instructor. The latter had asked the class to calculate the sum of


-----

whole numbers from 1 to 100, in the belief that he’d be giving himself a good
quarter of an hour’s peace. He hadn’t counted on one of the kids finding the
answer in seconds.

I was seventeen when our senior high school math teacher told us this story,

which had a big impression on us. We couldn’t figure out how Gauss was able to
calculate so quickly. Faced with such genius, we all felt ourselves rather
pathetic.

The explanation that our teacher gave us was that there was a “trick.” You

want to calculate the whole numbers from 1 to 100—that is, to add them up:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + . . . + 97 + 98 + 99 + 100

The trick consists of doubling this sum by counting each whole number

twice and placing the two sums on two lines, in the following manner:

1 +  2 +  3 +  4 + . . . + 97 + 98 + 99 + 100
+ 100 + 99 + 98 + 97 + . . . +  4 +  3 +  2 +   1

What a strange idea! Why put down each number twice? Why place them

one above the other in this bizarre fashion? Maybe it is strange, but you have the
right to do it. At any rate, each number from 1 to 100 does appear twice. The
value of the big sum is thus double the number that we’re looking for.

Now instead of looking at the lines, look at the columns. There are 100

columns and in each there are two numbers whose sum is always 101. It seems
like magic, but it’s true. The big sum thus equals 100 × 101, or 10,100. The
number we’re looking for is half of that, or 5,050.

Don’t be ashamed of having to read over this reasoning a number of times

before you find it convincing. As with all mathematical reasoning, there’s
something bizarre and intimidating about it. At first you have to decipher it line
by line, which takes a lot of time and effort.

The steps of the reasoning, however, are simple enough, and should allow

you to reach these three conclusions:

1. It’s a valid proof of the fact that the sum of whole numbers from 1 to 100

equals 5,050.

2. It’s believable that someone quick in mental calculations could do this

reasoning in their head in a few seconds.

3. But how on Earth could such a crazy idea arise in the head of the seven-year-


-----

old Gauss?

At any rate, those were the conclusions I made myself when I was seventeen.

I figured out that math wasn’t for me because it was meant for those other
people, those _geniuses,_ whose brains worked differently than mine and could
come up with such incredible ideas.

My teacher was an excellent instructor, and I’m grateful for everything he

taught me. But that day, by telling us there was a “trick,” he sent us the wrong
message.

There are no tricks. There never were any and there never will be. Believing

in the existence of tricks is as toxic as believing in the existence of truths that are
counterintuitive by nature. These are the two central superstitions of the System
2 dogma, this belief that our intuition isn’t worth a dime and that we have to
mechanically apply methods that we don’t fully understand.

Of course it can happen that things work without our understanding why. It

happens often enough. But it’s always a temporary situation that’s just waiting
for an explanation.

Believing that tricks exist is to accept the idea that there are things you’ll

never understand and that you have to learn by heart. It’s to confuse the line-byline verification of a proof with its intuitive understanding. It’s to enter into a
submissive relationship to System 2. It’s to accept a division of roles that is
deeply unfair and humiliating for you: the great geniuses find the tricks, while
you’re only good for checking that it all adds up.

Frankly, I couldn’t care less about verifying that the sum of whole numbers

from 1 to 100 really equals 5,050. What I want to know, what we all want to
know, is how to think like Gauss and Thurston.

## The Language Trap

To understand what’s hidden behind these math “tricks,” the simplest thing

is to follow a recipe for banana bread.

_Ingredients:_
1 1/2 cups (195 grams) all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon


-----

3 medium bananas
8 tablespoons (115 grams or 1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
3/4 cup (150 grams) packed light brown sugar
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

_Directions:_
1. In a large bowl, mash the bananas with a fork.
2. Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt.
3. Cream together the eggs and sugar.
4. Stir in the mashed bananas, vanilla, butter, and cinnamon.
5. Stir in the flour mixture, a third at a time, until just combined.
6. Pour the batter into a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan. Bake for about 1 hour at

350 degrees F.

Visualize the different steps of this recipe:

—You start by buying the bananas. They’re in your hand. You go to the register

to pay for them. Can you picture them?

—You’re at step 1. The bananas are in the bowl. You have a fork in your hand

and you’re getting ready to mash them. Can you still picture them?

Between these two steps, you’ve switched to a different mental image. Just

before mashing the bananas, you’ve mentally peeled them. Behind the so-called
“tricks,” there’s generally an operation of this kind: a change of mental image
that’s done in a flash, for “obvious” reasons that might not be so obvious to
anyone else.

When you’re familiar with bananas, it’s obvious that you have to peel them

before you mash them. But if you’ve never seen a banana before, it’s not so
obvious. Recipes never capture all the steps you need to take. There are always
some missing details, the famous “tricks.” It’s why so many people prefer
watching a cooking video to reading a recipe.

You’ve been acquainted with bananas since childhood. You could even say

that you’ve developed some kind of spiritual intimacy with them. You know a
lot of things about them that you’ve never told anyone. You know by heart the
string that runs along the flesh even if you don’t know its name. You’ve never
done anything with this string, but it’s always struck you by its appearance and


-----

properties. You also know, without ever having dared say it, that nothing on
Earth squishes in such a soft and satisfying manner as the flesh of a banana. The
word _banana_ doesn’t evoke just one mental image but a multitude of possible
mental images. Instantly, without even trying, and without anyone telling you
how to do it, you always pick the right image. Mashing bananas without peeling
them is so idiotic that you find it funny. It’s the stupid kind of thing that only a
robot would do.

When Gauss or Thurston wanted to add up the whole numbers from 1 to 100,

they picked the right way to visualize these numbers, the way that made the
calculation easier. They found it instantly, without any effort, and with no one to
tell them how. They knew how to mobilize their familiarity with numbers in the
same way that you know how to mobilize your familiarity with bananas. It’s
exactly the same kind of intelligence.

In mathematics, the sudden occurrence of a miracle or an idea that seems to

come out of nowhere is always the signal that you’re missing an image. Your
way of looking at things isn’t the right one. Something is missing. There exists a
better way, simpler, clearer, deeper, that you don’t know yet and that, perhaps,
no one yet knows. Looking for and finding the right way of seeing things is the
driving force of mathematics. It’s the main source of pleasure you can take from
it.

Each time someone talks to you about “tricks,” they’re telling you to stop

thinking at precisely the moment when it starts to get interesting.

The irony of all this is that while you were just getting familiar with bananas,

at that faraway time of your childhood, you were also getting familiar with
numbers. If you hadn’t developed the right level of intimacy with numbers, you
would never have been able to learn how to count.

Unfortunately, you’ve since lost this intimate relationship to numbers.

Following your early childhood, you fell into what I call the _language trap,_
which is what stops you from “seeing” the sum of whole numbers from 1 to 100
like Gauss or Thurston.

The language trap is the belief that naming things is enough to make them

exist, and we can dispense with the effort of really imagining them.

This belief is typical of the ideology of System 2. We’re told that we should

think with words and that yearning to move beyond words is a pipe dream. This
shortcut is problematic, if not an outright lie. Naming things certainly allows us
to evoke them, but not to make them present in our mind with the intensity and
clarity that allow for creative thinking.

“Don’t think of a pink elephant.” This is considered a linguistical paradox,


-----

since the sentence itself forces us to think of a pink elephant. Except that this
passive, reluctant way of thinking about pink elephants isn’t one that will allow
you to get to know and really understand them. Try to imagine a life-sized pink
elephant standing before you. Take the time to look at it and study it closely.
This intentional image will be incredibly more profound, more absorbing, more
precise than the fuzzy image formed in your mind at the beginning of this
paragraph. When you give free rein to your imagination, it is nearly without
limits.

It’s this effort of the imagination that allows you to get out of the language

trap and solve mathematical problems. This activity is at the heart of System 3. It
implies deliberately trying to see, without reserve or half measures, with a full
physical commitment.

When you read “the sum of whole numbers from 1 to 100,” if you content

yourself with the fuzzy image that forms in your head, you won’t really see
anything.

Instead of letting yourself be lulled by words, force yourself to think that the

sum is physically present in front of you. Force yourself to imagine the whole
numbers from 1 to 100 in physical form, made manifest in the real world,
carefully lined up in front of you. If you manage to see them and you take the
time to carefully examine the scene, you’ll find a way to calculate their sum.

To give you a chance to find it for yourself, I recommend you take a short

break before continuing.

## The Big Picture

In “On Proof and Progress in Mathematics,” the text cited in chapter 6 ,

Thurston gives some surprising advice—that I’ve never read anywhere else—
about the size of mathematical objects.

When we imagine them in our heads, we can choose to see them as “little

objects in our hands,” or as “bigger human-sized structures,” or as “spatial
structures that encompass us and that we move around in.” From a logical
standpoint, it shouldn’t make any difference. Thurston, however, says size is
quite important: “We tend to think more effectively with spatial imagery on a
larger scale: it’s as if our brains take larger things more seriously and can devote
more resources to them.”

What if people who are convinced that they don’t have any geometric

intuition simply make the mistake of imagining figures that are too small, so that
it’s impossible to see anything?


-----

At any rate, Thurston’s remark applies very well to elephants: imagine a tiny

elephant that you can hold in your hand, and now imagine a life-sized elephant,
who doesn’t look happy, and whose attention you don’t want to attract: it
mobilizes your cognitive resources in an entirely different manner.

The language trap is the extreme version of the phenomenon described by

Thurston. An expression like “the sum of whole numbers from 1 to 100” is a
convenient way to designate a very precise mathematical object. It allows you to
speak of it, but it’s also a way of getting rid of it, to put it at some distance, so
that it doesn’t bother you any longer.

You think you see the sum, but you don’t really. You can’t feel its looming

presence. You don’t take it seriously.

This sum can also be written as 5,050. The big advantage of decimal writing

is that it’s compact. It’s discrete, practical, easy to say and easy to write. This
mental representation has its weakness in its strength: the number is put at such a
distance that it becomes minuscule, almost invisible.

A mathematical equation always states that two writings that are different in

appearance designate in reality one and the same object. If you let yourself be
lulled to sleep by language, if you confuse words with the objects they designate,
you don’t give yourself any chance to “see” mathematical equations.

The only way to get there is to go beyond words. Replacing “the sum of

whole numbers from 1 to 100” with “1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + 98 + 99 + 100” is a good
start. You might have the impression of seeing the sum in a more tangible and
concrete way. But that’s only ever an illusion. In reality, you’ll be missing most
of the numbers, those hidden by the ellipses. Mathematical symbols are like
words, they belong to language. You also need to get beyond them.

To see the sum in its entirety, without shortcuts or abbreviations, to take it

seriously and give it the place it deserves, you need to imagine it as physically
present, life-sized, right in front of you.

Before imagining the sum, let’s start with a single number, for example, 3.

Imagining the number 3 in the physical world is easy enough: you just have to
imagine three objects, like in primary school when the teacher asks students to
picture three oranges _in their head._ This childlike relationship with numbers, this
need for a _bodily_ interaction with abstract things, is the right state of mind to do
mathematics. By seeing three oranges in place of the number 3, you begin
freeing yourself from the language trap. You stop confusing the writing of a
number with its value.

Mathematicians have a saying that a whole number always counts for

something. However, to imagine the sum of whole numbers from 1 to 100, I’d


-----

advise not using oranges: you’d find yourself with a lot of oranges—they will
spill all over the place and it will be a mess.

Personally, I find it much easier to imagine the scene using cubes. I’m able

to visualize each number as a pile of cubes and to arrange these piles side by
side, from 1 to 100.

It’s hard to draw exactly what I see in my head. My mental image isn’t

entirely distinct, and the pile would be too big to put on the page. I’m only able,
therefore, to draw an approximation. Seen head on, it would look something like
this:

The drawing is wrong, but that doesn’t matter. What matters is to know in

what way it is wrong. In this case, there are some cubes missing. Instead of
having eighteen cubes across and eighteen cubes high, as in my drawing, the pile
should have one hundred cubes across and one hundred cubes high. You need to
keep that in mind. Despite that, this drawing seems to me to be a good way to
share my mental image (if I drew all the cubes, they would be too tiny).

Voilà! We’re done. Wasn’t that easy?
Mathematicians tend to think that a proof is finished once they feel that the

right image is formed in their heads, like when chess players stop the game
before checkmate once they see one player has a winning position.

But let’s take the time to finish the game, as the coming checkmate may not

yet be that obvious to you.


-----

If you have this image in your head, it’s difficult not to see a triangle. The

number you’re looking for, that is, the total number of cubes, is the area of the
triangle. There is a simple primary school equation to calculate the area. Here are
two ways to finish the game, depending on whether you know the equation.

1. _You know the equation._ To calculate the area of a triangle, you multiply

the base by the height and divide by 2. Here the base is 100 and the height is
100. Multiplying them gives us 10,000 and dividing that by 2 gives us 5,000.

We’re almost there. We just made the same error Thurston did when he was

five. That’s a good sign; we’re surely on the right track.

The error was forgetting about the half cubes that are above the diagonal and

aren’t counted in the area of the triangle. We’ve forgotten 100 half cubes, so we
have to add 50, which makes 5,050.

2. _You don’t know the equation._ No worries, you’re going to reinvent it. By

looking carefully, you can see that a triangle is a half of a rectangle. If you take
your initial triangular pile (in white) and a copy of this triangular pile (in gray),
and then turn the copy and put it on top of the initial pile, you come up with
something like this:


-----

You thus get a rectangle 100 cubes across and 101 cubes high, therefore

formed of 100 x 101 = 10,100 cubes. There are thus 5,050 cubes in each triangle.
The famous “trick” that consists of taking the two sums and putting them one
over the other is nothing more than that, a way of breaking down the area of the
rectangle into the two triangles:

1 +  2 +  3 +  4 + . . . + 97 + 98 + 99 + 100
+ 100 + 99 + 98 + 97 + . . . +  4 +  3 +  2 +   1

## Probabilistic Kung Fu

The ball and the bat, the sum of whole numbers from 1 to 100: I love these

problems because they are elementary, and yet they fully illustrate the gap that
separates official mathematics, the prisoner of language, and secret mathematics,
what you do inside your head.

In both cases, a simple visualization effort suffices to make something easy

that 99 percent of people don’t find easy at all.

It’s not always so simple. Visualization isn’t always enough, and the issue

isn’t to deprive yourself of mechanical deductive reasoning. In order to
understand mathematics, you have to train yourself to bring together imagination
and language, intuition and logic, reverie and calculation, seeing both the big
picture and the details.


-----

Nor do I want to give the impression that math problems are always

numerical and that all intuition is geometric in nature.

Mathematical objects are very diverse in nature, and their intuitive

comprehension mobilizes different mental resources. The table enumerates
several of the main mathematical domains. It’s incomplete and oversimplified,
but it gives you a general idea.

These domains each have their own vocabulary and intuitions. It’s like they

correspond to different ways of using our bodies, different regions in our brains,
different ways of focusing our attention. They might give the impression that
they’re talking about different things, but in fact they’re simply bringing
different points of view to the same reality, the mathematical reality. When you
get to experience it, the unity of mathematics is absolutely fascinating. It can
even be overwhelming.

The main areas of mathematics

_Domain_ _Objects studied_

Arithmetic Whole numbers

Geometry Space and shapes

Topology Spaces and shapes that can be stretched and twisted

Group theory Symmetries and transformations

Algebra Abstract structures

Analysis Limits, “infinitely small things”

Probability theory Chance, randomness

Logic Proofs (seen as mathematical objects)

Algorithmics Procedures and computations (seen as mathematical objects)

Dynamical systems Things that evolve with time

Combinatorics Ways to count objects

Very often, mathematical discoveries are merely bridges between two

intuitions of different kinds.

At a very elementary level, this is what we’ve just done above: a geometry

formula (that gives the area of a triangle or rectangle) allowed us to solve an
arithmetic problem (the sum of whole numbers from 1 to 100).

Let’s conclude this chapter with another, even more striking example.
If you have problems visualizing whole numbers from 1 to 100 life-sized

before you, there’s an easier way. Instead of tiring yourself out by dealing with
all the numbers from 1 to 100, why not take only one of them, at random? When


-----

you randomly choose a number between 1 and 100, what is its value _on_
_average?_

If that seems abstract to you, here’s a concrete way of imagining it. You’re

on a game show. In a bag, there are one hundred checks: a check for $1, a check
for $2, and so on up to a check for $100. You can pick only one check, eyes
closed. On average, how much do you expect to win?

I’ll repeat the question: _when you choose a number at random from 1 to 100,_

_what is its value on average?_

Most people will answer “50” without thinking. It just seems obvious to

them. But if the average of whole numbers from 1 to 100 is 50, then their sum
must be 5,000: the sum of 100 numbers is 100 times their average. That’s also
obvious to most people.

So what is it that keeps people from answering without thinking, like the

five-year-old Thurston did, that the sum of whole numbers from 1 to 100 is
5,000?

(If your intuition does tell you that the average is 50, it’s slightly wrong.

Don’t worry, it’s exactly the same mistake Thurston made. The average is
actually 50.5. At this stage, an error of 1 percent shouldn’t spoil your fun.)

What just happened? How is it even possible? How come the difficulty of

the problem vanished all of a sudden, like it was vaporized? If this seems absurd
to you, it’s because you’re underestimating the power of probabilistic thinking.
Assembling 5,050 cubes in your head is a demanding task, it almost feels like
you need a forklift. In contrast, the probabilistic approach is a sort of kung fu
that focuses your attention on a single number while your subconscious does all
the heavy lifting.

In fact, you already knew how to calculate the sum of whole numbers from 1

to 100, even if you were not aware that you did.

The notion of _average_ is a purely human invention, an abstract mathematical

concept that you were taught and that you’ve assimilated in the deepest part of
yourself, just like decimal writing. You’ve learned to “see” averages, that is, to
calculate them without even thinking or having to write them down. If you want
to validate your intuition and transform it into rigorous thinking, if you really
want to understand why the average is 50.5 rather than 50, you need to listen to
yourself, to your unconscious processes and their mechanisms.

This introspective work is at the heart of mathematics. It implies

deconstructing the mental images that you use without thinking and identifying
where you can improve them. Done properly, this practice will reinforce your
intuition day after day.


-----

Mathematicians manipulate abstractions whose abstract nature they’ve

forgotten, and that they prefer to call _objects._ They also like to say that these
objects _exist._ By saying that, they don’t necessarily want to take part in the old
metaphysical debate that since Plato has argued over the reality of abstractions.
They simply want to say that that’s how they do math: by creating familiar ties
to these objects, letting themselves imagine and manipulate them in their heads
exactly as you would a banana.

To get to really know a mathematical object, you have to observe it for a

long time, with intensity and detachment, with curiosity and open-mindedness.
You need to take the time to play with it and create an intimate relationship, a
relationship that takes place _outside of language._

When Einstein said he was “passionately curious,” when Grothendieck said

he was “alone and listening to things, intensely absorbed in a child’s game,” this
is what they were talking about.

## 13
 Looking Like a Fool

When I started as an undergrad, I thought that mathematical creativity was

reserved for people smarter than me. I thought that mathematical intelligence
was innate and that everyone received a predetermined quantity. I was lucky
enough to get a bit above the average. The geniuses got scandalously more.

I hadn’t yet understood that mathematical intelligence was something you

constructed for yourself. It’s the natural byproduct of a physical activity that
everyone is free to practice: mathematical imagination.

Mathematics is the science of imagination. Between those who allow

themselves to imagine, observe, and manipulate mathematical objects and those
who don’t, there’s an enormous divide. Over the years, this divide becomes
monstrous, obscene, almost as monstrous and obscene as the divide between
children with a room full of toys and games, and those who don’t even know
toys exist.

Contrary to popular belief, logic isn’t the enemy of imagination. It can even

be a close ally. The real enemy of imagination, that which blocks understanding
and makes us feel like fools, is fear.

Fear is our real limitation. It concerns all of us, at every level, from the worst

to the best, beginners to famous academics. We all have our blind spots, those
words whose simple utterance fills us with terror because we’ve associated them
with our deepest insecurities, our certainty that we’re not good enough. We’re
petrified by the sign “Reserved for geniuses” that bars the entrance, forgetting
that we put the sign up ourselves the day we told ourselves that math was too
hard for us.

The saddest thing about the fear of math is that even though you know it’s

just in your head, it doesn’t change anything. It’s like fear of heights: you know
it’s only in your head, but all the same, you’re still afraid.


-----

## Failed Conversations

Throughout my progress in math, I’ve experienced three big breakthroughs

—three periods of liberation when, following a change in my psychological
attitude, I felt the fear in me receding.

I spoke about the first two of these episodes in chapters 9 and 10 . First, by

paying attention to the dissonance between my intuition and logic, I chased away
my fear of not succeeding on the first try. I allowed myself to imagine freely,
even when I didn’t yet fully understand something. Then, betting on an extreme
mental plasticity, I started to address my fear of not being smart enough. If I
observed the world with candor and sincerity, if I took the time to soak it all in,
it was possible to overcome my limitations and become creative.

The third and most unexpected of these breakthroughs happened later, when

I was in my thirties. I learned to chase away my fear of _being perceived_ as not
smart enough.

Up until then, despite an honorable beginning to my career and some initial

success, I remained convinced that I wasn’t a real mathematician. I attributed my
success to luck. I told myself that I was an imposter, and that I would end up
being found out. When I was teaching at Yale, I was having actual nightmares.

Our deepest fears are often social. For mathematicians, we’re often afraid

we’re not as smart as the others, and that they’ll see it.

I’ve seen this same fear in the eyes of most young mathematicians I met. It’s

a natural enough phenomenon. I spoke in chapter 4 of the optical illusion that
makes us underestimate the difficulty of math we really understand for the
simple reason that it seems obvious to us.

There’s a second factor that specifically concerns young academics.

Normally, an academic is someone who knows things. When you become a
professional mathematician, your social identity becomes that of someone who
is smart. Except it doesn’t at all work that way, and no one has warned you about
it.

This misunderstanding can give rise to an aggressive form of imposter

syndrome. I know people who have been overwhelmed by it, to the point where
it permanently damaged their creativity.

Mathematics is a practice rather than knowledge. Mathematicians understand

better than anyone the objects they’re working on, but their mathematical
intuition can never become omnipotent. Objects they aren’t familiar with still
raise difficulties. You can be an exceptional athlete, Olympic champion with the
javelin, in peak physical condition, but that won’t stop you from being crushed


-----

at tennis by a decent junior player.

In mathematical research, there is no position of authority. That creates

disturbing, emotionally troubled situations that go against what is socially
expected of us.

Here’s a real-life situation that I personally experienced. You’re supposed to

be a bright young researcher. You’ve just gotten a prestigious position and
you’re an invited speaker at an international conference. At dinner, you find
yourself seated next to a young doctoral student who is explaining what she’s
working on. You don’t understand a word she’s saying. You ask her a question.
You don’t understand her answer. Since you’re stubborn, you risk telling her
straight out that you don’t understand. “No worry,” she says, “let me reexplain it
with a simple example; you’ll get it right away.” And there she reexplains it
using different words, and you still don’t understand anything she’s saying.

The problem isn’t with her explanation. The problem is with you. To

understand, you’d have to start all over from the beginning, from the basics. Her
work is related to a theory that you’re supposed to have learned in graduate
school, but which never made any sense to you. And, of course, you never dared
tell anyone.

You’re at the edge of what’s socially acceptable. Your credibility is at stake.

If you acknowledge how lost you are, you’ll look like a fool. The social norm is
to let it go.

This situation is typical of all failed math conversations, those we learn

nothing from, those that serve only to reinforce our certainty that we’re the worst
of the worst.

Whatever your level of math, you know what I’m talking about. The vast

majority of math conversations end with this feeling of malaise. They fail for
this simple reason: you don’t dare say how lost you are. You’re ashamed, you
feel ridiculous, and this idea gnaws at you and makes you incapable of listening.
You think only of your own worthlessness. It’s what keeps you from imagining
and learning. You come out of these conversations feeling humiliated.

When I was thirty-two, I learned a social engineering technique to change

the dynamics of these conversations.

I learned the technique directly from Jean-Pierre Serre, whom we spoke of in

chapter 7 , the person Grothendieck wrote to about his “ridiculous piece.”

The lesson lasted five seconds flat and consisted of a single sentence. It’s the

most effective lesson in mathematical psychology that I’ve had in my life. I
thought it over for months before I completely understood its scope. Thanks to
this method, I’ve never again left a math conversation feeling humiliated.


-----

I suspect there’s a cause and effect: between age thirty-two and thirty-five, I

underwent a formidable acceleration of my mathematical understanding. For the
first time, I felt completely legitimate and at ease. I made spectacular progress in
my research and I’m quite proud of the theorems I proved during this period.

## The Art of Giving Math Talks

I’ll of course share the technique Serre taught me, but first I have to explain

the context.

Before new mathematical results are edited and published, they’re generally

presented in oral form at seminars and conferences. I’ve always enjoyed giving
math talks, although the format can be intimidating, especially when it’s at the
blackboard. Talks usually last an hour, you’re all alone with a piece of chalk in
your hand, facing an audience of specialists who look at you impassively and
may at any time interrupt you with questions. It doesn’t leave a lot of room to
bluff. But that’s what’s exciting.

I remember very well my first research presentation, in 1997 at the Isaac

Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Cambridge. I was a PhD student
and I was absolutely terrified. To fight against my own insecurities, I chose to
position the talk at the most elementary level possible, which demanded an
incredible amount of preparation. I looked for ways to tell the story with the
simplest mental images and the most natural connections.

In a way, I was trying to minimize mental energy—my own as well as that of

the audience. A good metaphor is rock climbing: to climb up a cliff, you need to
find a path and a series of actions that require minimal effort. You can succeed
only if it’s easy. If it’s hard, you’ll end up hurting yourself very, very badly.

This talk was a revelation for me. I understood that it was only by explaining

it to others that I was able to really understand my own results. This is a wellknown phenomenon, and mathematicians have a saying, that the only thing a
math lesson is good for is to allow the professor to understand.

The best way for me to understand my own math is to imagine that I have to

explain it to complete beginners. By playing the fool with myself, I end up
finding ways to present my results as being obvious.

This minimalist approach became my presentation style, as opposed to the

esoteric style and bluster behind which a lot of young mathematicians like to
hide. I was initially afraid that the naïveté of my presentations wasn’t doing me
any favors. The risk was that people wouldn’t take me seriously. The opposite
happened. The simpler my talks were, the more intelligent people thought I was.


-----

One day, I had to give a lecture at the Chevalley Seminar, a group theory

seminar in Paris. I didn’t have substantial new results to announce, but it was an
opportunity to make a presentation even simpler than usual.

When I got to the room, fifteen or so researchers were there, along with a

few students seated in the rear. A couple of minutes before the talk was to start,
Serre came in and sat in the second row.

I was honored to have him in the audience, but I let him know right off that

the presentation might not be very interesting to him. It was intended for a
general audience and I was going to be explaining very basic things.

What I didn’t tell him, of course, was that his presence was intimidating.

Still, I didn’t want to raise the level of my talk only to keep him interested. I just
kept an eye out to see if he’d taken off his glasses, which would mean he was
getting bored and had stopped listening. No worries there—he kept his glasses
on till the end.

I gave my presentation as I would have without him there, speaking to the

entire audience, especially the students seated in the back, whom I was pleased
to see listening and looking like they understood.

It was a normal presentation, fairly successful, not very deep but well

prepared, clear, and intelligible. At the end of the seminar, Serre came up to me
and said—and here I quote verbatim: “You’ll have to explain that to me again,
because I didn’t understand anything.”

## Looking Like a Fool

That’s a true story, and it plunged me into a state of profound perplexity.
Apparently, Serre wasn’t using the verb _to understand_ the way most people

use it. The concepts and reasonings of my talk couldn’t really have caused him
any difficulty. I’m sure he wanted to say that he understood what I had
explained, but he hadn’t understood _why_ what I had explained was true.

It’s a bit like with the sum of whole numbers from 1 to 100, where there are

two levels of understanding. The first level consists of following the reasoning
step by step and _accepting_ that it’s correct. Accepting is not the same as
understanding. The second level is real understanding. It requires _seeing_ where
the reasoning comes from and why it’s natural.

In thinking again about Serre’s comment, I realized that my presentation had

too many “miracles,” too many arbitrary choices, too many things that worked
without my really knowing why. Serre was right; it was incomprehensible. His
feedback helped me become aware of a number of very big holes in my


-----

understanding of the objects and situations I was working on at the time.

In the years that followed, research into explanations for these various

miracles allowed me to fill in some of the holes and achieve some of the most
important results of my career. (However, some of the miracles remain
unexplained to this day.)

But the most troubling aspect was the abruptness, the frankness with which

Serre had overplayed his own incomprehension.

It takes a lot of nerve to listen closely to a presentation, then go up to the

speaker, smile, and tell him that you “didn’t understand anything.” I never would
have dared.

Why did he do it? I first told myself it must be one of the things you have the

right to do when you’re Jean-Pierre Serre. Then I realized that could also work
the other way: what if this technique had actually helped him _become_ Jean-Pierre
Serre?

I decided to try it myself, just to be sure.
A few months later, at a conference, I found myself at a table next to a PhD

student. During dessert, he started talking to me about what he was working on.
Needless to say, I didn’t understand a word he was saying. After dinner, I took
him aside and said: “Explain it to me again, but very simply, very slowly. I don’t
understand anything about your subject. Assume that I have brain damage and
can’t focus my attention for more than a few seconds.”

That made him smile, and he had the kindness to explain it slowly and

calmly, starting from the beginning, with the basics in his field, that I should
have known but up till now had never succeeded in understanding.

His explanation didn’t have anything to do with what he had said over

dinner. He didn’t use the same words, and didn’t even talk of the same things. It
was as if he had two completely different ways of talking about the subject of his
research. It was like there was the _tourist menu,_ the official explanation he
served up when he wanted to appear serious, and the _secret menu,_ the simple and
intuitive way he understood the things himself.

Because he was a student and I was an established scholar, I had higher

social status. At dinner, he had tried to impress me by serving me the _tourist_
_menu._ By overplaying my own worthlessness, I granted him permission to place
himself on equal footing and just blurt it out.

Another benefit of Serre’s technique is that it readily takes away the drama

of all the stupid questions that you’d want to ask. Instead of asking them bit by
bit, having the feeling that you’re going backwards and losing your dignity with
each passing moment of the conversation, it’s much more comfortable to jump


-----

right in from the outset, admitting that sure, you’re going to ask a lot of stupid
questions, and you’ll even be asking the same stupid questions over and over.

If you start up a math conversation, it’s to learn something, not to be

humiliated.

Sometimes you spend half the time reviewing the basics that you’d

misunderstood, and sometimes that’s all you do. At any rate, that’s better than to
talk about things you can’t make any sense of. If the person you’re talking with
doesn’t place themself at your level, and refuses to start with the basics and lead
you by the hand, there’s no use getting distraught. You’ve probably stumbled
across an actual fraud, someone who pretends to explain math that is beyond
their own comprehension. The real imposters are the ones without the syndrome.

The beauty of this approach is that by playing the fool you’ll end up

impressing people with your own self-confidence.

## Refusing Fear

Serre’s technique is simple and powerful. And it would seem everyone could

do it. In theory, nothing is stopping you from looking people in the eyes and
telling them smilingly that you didn’t understand a thing and they need to
explain it again from the beginning. Clearly, it’s not a question of IQ.

Try it and you’ll see.
It seems easy, but it’s not. It might be hard to bluff and pretend that you

understand. It’s even harder to stop bluffing altogether and ask all the stupid
questions that come to mind, without filter, without shame. Serre’s technique is
the social version of what we called in chapter 7 _the child’s pose._ This requires a
great command of your body and emotions, because we have the instinct to hide
our ignorance.

And it’s spectacularly harder if you worry that you might be written off as an

actual idiot. This is why math is such an amplifier for all stereotypes and social
insecurities. If you’re part of a minority that lacks recognition and role models, if
you’re secretly convinced that your genes make you incapable of understanding
math, or simply if being bad at math has become part of your social identity, it
will be so much harder for you.

In the end, fearing that math is too difficult for you is a self-fulfilling

prophecy. I have no easy fix to offer, apart from a few practical tips and the
generic advice to keep pushing.

What Serre taught me was that it’s better to be straightforward and direct

rather than to beat around the bush. You might as well make fun of revealing


-----

what makes you ashamed and what you’d like to hide. Humor is the best weapon
I know against fear. By pushing your own intellectual limitations to absurd
levels, you can create a temporary zone of childlike freedom where any and all
questions are allowed.

It’s also essential to seek the right mentors. I’ve already spoken in chapter 9

of the video interview given by Pierre Deligne after he received the Abel Prize.
It was an opportunity for him to share his vision of mathematics and recount
some of the decisive moments of his career, including his first interaction with
Grothendieck, before the latter became his PhD advisor.

Deligne, who was a young student at the time, went to a seminar given by

Grothendieck, and was intimidated by his large silhouette and shaved head.
During the presentation, Grothendieck spoke nonstop about “cohomology
objects,” a mathematical concept central to his work. But Deligne didn’t
understand any of it. At the end of the lecture he approached Grothendieck and
asked him to explain what he meant by “cohomology objects.”

It’s a little like sitting through a lecture by Einstein and going up to him

afterwards to ask what he meant by “relativity.” More than a half century later,
Deligne still admired Grothendieck’s reaction: “That was really typical of him.
Other people would have thought that, if I didn’t know what this was, then really
it was not worth speaking with me. That was not his reaction at all. Very
patiently he [explained it to me].”

This patience and benevolence had a great impact on Deligne, and allowed

him to flourish:

He was extremely kind, one could ask apparently completely stupid questions. Being with him, I
wasn’t shy at all asking questions which would be completely stupid, and I’ve kept this habit until
now. I usually sit in front of the audience attending a lecture, and if I have something I don’t
understand I’ll ask, even if I would be supposed to know what the answer is.

These aren’t just words. If Deligne takes the time to insist, it’s because he

knows how difficult it is. He’s seen so many mathematicians fail at precisely this
point, because they aren’t able to attain the right level of candor and
transparency. The most difficult thing in math is to overcome our shame or
instinct for flight, our reflex for dissimulation. It’s all a question of composure
and physical engagement.

In his social media profile on MathOverflow, Thurston wrote something

similar:

Mathematics is a process of staring hard enough with enough perseverance at the fog of muddle and


-----

confusion to eventually break through to improved clarity. I’m happy when I can admit, at least to
myself, that my thinking is muddled, and I try to overcome the embarrassment that I might reveal
ignorance or confusion. Over the years, this has helped me develop clarity in some things, but I
remain muddled in many others.

Serre, Deligne, Thurston, Grothendieck: if these outstanding mathematicians

all insist on the same point, it’s not a coincidence. The struggle against our
inhibitions and stumbling blocks is the essence of mathematical work.

It’s normal not to understand. It’s normal to be afraid. It’s normal to have to

struggle to contain your fear. It is, in fact, precisely what’s at stake.

## 14
 A Martial Art

Early in the year 1649 René Descartes received an invitation from Queen

Christine of Sweden via the ambassador of France at Stockholm. She wanted
him to come and give her private lessons.

Before accepting, Descartes wanted to make sure that she was serious. He

told the ambassador: if this is only a whim, if the queen doesn’t have the
necessary motivation to truly learn, he wouldn’t make the trip.

The year before, he’d wasted his time by accepting an invitation to Paris:

“What disgusted me the most was that none of them showed any desire to know
anything else about me but my face.” It is the price of celebrity. He had the
feeling that people wanted him not for his ideas, but “like an elephant or a
panther, because of its rarity.”

Three centuries before Einstein, Descartes was one of the first intellectuals to

achieve the status of a rock star.

He ended up accepting Queen Christine’s invitation and went to Stockholm,

where he died of pneumonia at the age of fifty-three on February 11, 1650.
When his body was being returned to France, his skull was stolen. It circulated
on the black market for two centuries. The various owners engraved their names
on it, as if the skull were endowed with magical powers that they could
appropriate. The skull finally found its resting place in the Musée de l’Homme in
Paris, where it is displayed next to the skull of an Australopithecus.

## “The most evenly distributed thing in the world”

By now, we know the story by heart. It’s the same story we’ve been

repeating from page 1. It’s the story of our refusal to believe that math is first
and foremost an _attitude,_ and our insistence that people who are good at it must
have some kind of brain abnormality. And when an actual genius dares say


-----

otherwise, we cut his head open to see what’s inside.

In 1637, before becoming a celebrity, Descartes had published an

autobiographical essay, _Discourse on Method,_ in which he outlined his
intellectual journey. He revealed his work methods and told how he had become
the greatest mathematician of his time. From the opening lines, the message is
radically clear, and Descartes thinks he has no special talent:

For myself, I have never presumed my mind to be any way more accomplished than that of the
common man. Indeed, I have often wished that my mind was as fast, my imagination as clear and
precise, and my memory as well stocked and sharp as those of certain other people.

What Descartes admits to is having a different way of looking at things,

thanks to a particular method that he was lucky enough to stumble upon:

I have fashioned a method by which, it seems to me, I have a way of adding progressively to my
knowledge and raising it by degrees to the highest point that the limitations of my mind and the
short span of life allotted to me will permit it to reach.

This method, as he describes it to us, is of a childish simplicity. It requires

only one mental resource, the “good sense” that we’re all endowed with. In other
words, we all have the potential to become Descartes. In order not to leave any
doubt, he opens his book with a sentence in the form of a slogan: “Good sense is
the most evenly distributed thing in the world.”

We never had the chance to have our discussion with Einstein. _Harvests and_

_Sowings_ is an obscure, almost unreadable text. _Discourse on Method,_ on the
other hand, is one of the most widely read and commented upon texts in the
history of thought. How is it possible that nearly four centuries after its
publication almost no one is aware of the existence of a _method_ for becoming
good at math?

Our collective inability to read Descartes is quite frankly extraordinary. We

pretend to read it, we pretend to understand it, we pretend to find it important,
but in reality we categorically refuse to take it seriously. Deep down we’re all
convinced that he’s making fun of us.

This misunderstanding runs deep and explains much of our failure to

democratize mathematics. But it is much broader than that. In fact, its extent is
abysmal.

Indeed, Descartes didn’t stop at mathematics. After developing his particular

method, after practicing it with an iron discipline, after validating it through
great mathematical discoveries, he set out to use it to reconstruct the entirety of


-----

science and philosophy.

The school of thought he founded is called _rationalism._ Our science and

technology are direct descendants. Rationalism encountered limitations and
pitfalls that Descartes didn’t foresee, which we’ll return to later. That doesn’t
take away from its success. The rationalist approach lives on in each of us, and
whether we like it or not, we all know that rationality serves a purpose, just as
we all know that math is extraordinarily powerful. Even if we have a hard time
explaining why.

When we refuse to take Descartes seriously, it’s rationality itself that we are

refusing to understand.

_Discourse on Method_ isn’t a book of theory. It’s a personal testimony, in

which Descartes describes a number of mental techniques that he experimented
with on himself. He affirms that these techniques allowed him to develop his
cognitive abilities, build self-confidence, and make great discoveries. As proof
of what he’s saying, he accompanies his text with three scientific texts, including
_Geometry,_ a mathematical work so revolutionary that it remade our language and
imagination (for the first time in history, Descartes used the letter _x_ to designate
an unknown).

_Discourse on Method_ is a self-help book whose message is simple: we have

the ability to construct our own intelligence and self-confidence.

## The Secret Rationality

When you’re a mathematician, you often meet people who say to you,

“You’re the rational one” or “You’re the one who likes logic” or (worst of all)
“You’re the one who’s good at math.”

It’s always a bad sign, because behind that there is always an underlying tone

of “You’re one of those weirdos,” “You know nothing about life,” or “You’re
the one on whom I’m going to pour out all the frustration I’ve built up through
my school years.”

Rationality has as bad a reputation as mathematics. And like the latter, it

exists in two versions. The visible side of rationality presents itself in the form of
established knowledge, science and technology, and well-structured and
logically sound arguments. Schools spend a lot of time teaching it, with mixed
results.

The flip side of rationality, its secret and intimate dimension, remains largely

undocumented, as if we’d made a deliberate choice to cover it up.

In chapter 11 , I presented reason (and thus rationality) as a synonym for


-----

System 2 (mechanical thinking that follows rules and logic). It’s a convenient
shortcut because that’s what it means to a lot of people. But it also results in
major issues. By opposing rationality to System 1 (intuitive and instantaneous
thinking), we’re setting it in opposition to human understanding. It’s no surprise
then that so many people view it as dry and unappealing.

This version of rationality is a tough sell, but it doesn’t stop some from

trying to sell it. Most often they adopt a stance of superiority and disdain. “Be
rational” is their way of telling us “Eat your vegetables,” “Do your homework,”
“Respect authority,” “Curb your desires,” “Agree with me.” They order us to be
rational but they’re incapable of explaining precisely what that consists of. They
praise Descartes without realizing how much they’re getting him wrong. It never
even occurs to them that, with such pitiful ideas, Descartes would have long
been forgotten, and none of his contemporaries would have admired him “like an
elephant or a panther.”

If you open _Discourse on Method_ looking for a glorification of System 2,

you’ll be sadly disappointed. Descartes’s great innovation was to put intuition
and subjectivity at the heart of his approach to knowledge. He was distrustful of
established knowledge and what was written in books. He placed little credit in
authorities. He preferred to reconstruct everything by himself, in his head. His
method closely resembles that of Einstein, Thurston, and Grothendieck. It is, of
course, System 3, the slow and careful dialogue between intuition and logic,
with the aim of developing your intuition.

Descartes was candid about it: his method was simply that of

mathematicians. He described it without ever speaking of rationality or
rationalism. These words didn’t even exist in his time. They were invented later
to characterize his approach. As for whether or not Descartes would pass today
for a “rational person,” I’ll let you judge for yourself.

## “The great book of the world”

René Descartes was born in 1596 in a small village in the center of France,

whose inhabitants have since renamed it Descartes. The world Descartes lived in
was very different from our own. In order to understand his thought, we must
first understand his world.

The best way to ruin _Discourse on Method_ is to see it as a world classic that

might give you advice on how to succeed in school, or the work of an academic
that explains how to do research that will win the esteem of your colleagues.

This isn’t Descartes’s message, and his life doesn’t correspond to any


-----

modern stereotype of intellectual life. He never held an academic position, and
he didn’t make a living writing. He had been a brilliant student, eager to learn as
much as he could, but passed a harsh judgment on what he had been taught: “As
soon as I had finished my course of study, at which time it is usual to be
admitted to the ranks of the well-educated . . . I found myself bogged down in so
many doubts and errors, that it seemed to me that having set out to become
learned, I had derived no benefit from my studies.”

Descartes decided to turn away from scholarly “speculations” and learn

directly from “the great book of the world,” going wherever that might take him:
“I spent the rest of my youth travelling, visiting courts and armies, mixing with
people of different character and rank, accumulating different experiences,
putting myself to the test in situations in which I found myself by chance.”

## A Martial Art

Descartes was pretty explicit about his great passion in life: “seeking truth.”
It’s easy to make fun of that, to sneer, to look condescendingly from the top

of our postmodern heights, to pretend as if the notion of truth were a thing of the
past. However, this is precisely where Descartes has the most to teach us.

As long as we conflate rationality and logic, as long as we reduce truth to its

social and linguistic dimensions, as long as we see it only as a matter of
consensus or authority, we completely miss the point of the Cartesian approach.

For Descartes, truth was a matter of life and death. He perfectly embodies

this singular and powerful aspect of mathematical psychology: his relationship to
the truth is physical, almost carnal:

I constantly felt a burning desire to learn to distinguish the true from the false, to see my actions for
what they were, and to proceed with confidence through life.

Descartes cared less for easy truths, those that are supposed to be true

because tradition or such-and-such a person says so, or simply because they
seem true. What interested him were solid truths, those that weren’t going to
change overnight, the ones you can rely on to become stronger and more
confident, to make the right choices in life.

He approached truth as a martial art, an instinct you develop and that

becomes embodied in action. Everything else—the philosophical arguments, the
“opinions” of intellectuals with no skin in the game—was all just talk and of no
interest to him: “For it seemed to me that I could discover much more truth from


-----

the reasoning that we all make about things that affect us and that will soon
cause us harm if we misjudge them, than from the speculations in which a
scholar engages in the privacy of his study, that have no consequence for him.”

In this light, Descartes’s uncommon obsession with fencing isn’t that

surprising. At age twenty, he overcame his self-confessed “dislike [of] the
business of writing books” and wrote a two-part treatise on the matter. The
manuscript has since been lost, but a surviving summary shows us his
precocious interest in the problem of mastery of the body.

If _The Art of Fencing_ were published today, it might become an instant best

seller, at least if the second part of the treatise lived up to its promise: “how you
can always beat your opponent” if it’s a competition of “two people of the same
size, same strength, and same weapons.”

But here again, our modern perspective might make us completely miss the

point. For Descartes, fencing wasn’t a hobby done on weekends at a club
between well-meaning people. Nor was it a metaphor for intellectual jousting.
Fencing was quite literally a martial art, an art of war.

At age twenty-two, confident in his body and his method, he started off in a

career generally thought to be of little use in the development of the mind: he
signed up as a mercenary.

## The Rational Dream


-----

During Descartes’s time, the great minds of Europe were tormented by a

deep question: does the Sun turn around the Earth, or is it the other way around?

It takes a real effort of the imagination to picture what “torment” might

actually mean here. In today’s world, there’s no scientific debate that engages
people’s minds with the same intensity. There might be some people who debate
whether the Earth is flat, but it would be greatly exaggerated to say that science
is “tormented” by the question.

By challenging the traditional view that placed the Earth at the center of the

universe, Copernicus had sparked much more than a scientific quarrel. He had
forced the Christian world to consider this existential question: is the truth
necessarily what is written in books, or do we, as human beings, have the ability
to discover it ourselves?

On the night of November 10–11, 1619, at the age of twenty-three, while he

was stationed at Neuburg an der Donau in Germany, Descartes had a series of
three dreams.

The first was rather complicated and notably featured a melon someone

wanted to give him and which, according to Descartes, represented “the charms
of solitude.”

In the second dream, he had the feeling of being struck by lightning. He

woke up with a start and saw sparks all around him, as if the room were on fire.
Here again he gave an interpretation: it was “the Spirit of Truth” that had come
to take possession of him.

The third dream was what is called a _lucid dream:_ in the middle of it,

Descartes became aware that he was dreaming, and began to interpret his own
dream while it was happening.

A dictionary appeared on the table. He was glad and told himself it might

come in handy. But a second book drew his attention, a large collection of poetry
that he was leafing through when a stranger came and showed him a poem.
Descartes recognized the beginning of “The Pythagorean Yes and No” by the
Latin poet Ausonius, and he began to look for it in the collection.

A bit later, Descartes realized that the dictionary was damaged. Then the

man and the books disappeared. Without waking up, Descartes interpreted the
dictionary as a symbol of science and the poetry collection as a symbol of
philosophy and wisdom. The substance of the dream was precisely that: it is
necessary to reconstruct science while being inspired by the techniques of poets
who, through “the divinity of enthusiasm” and “the force of imagination,” are
able to uncover “the seeds of wisdom (which are found in the spirit of all men,
like the sparks of fire in stone).”


-----

Descartes thus invented rationality. Upon awakening, he was convinced that

the Spirit of Truth had descended upon him to “open the treasures of all the
sciences” by revealing that truth is not to be found in books, but in our heads.
We have the ability to discover it ourselves, by the power of our thought.

For Descartes, evidence is the core criterion of truth. Not superficial

evidence, the initial intuition that is often false, but evidence constructed through
a deliberate and systematic effort of clarification, verbalization, and explanation,
which aims to make things perfectly intelligible until they become fully
transparent: “Things that we conceive of very clearly and distinctly are always
true.”

## The True Mathematics

This revelation would guide the rest of his life. The following year, in 1620,

Descartes abandoned his military career to dedicate himself to science. He began
with arithmetic and geometry, “the easiest and clearest of all the sciences,”
where he made an auspicious debut with first-class results.

He saw in mathematics the basis of all knowledge, not only in the technical

sense we’ve grown accustomed to (since the seventeenth century, mathematical
formalism has become one of the basic tools of science), but also, and above all,
in a basic, primordial sense, seated in the depths of human psychology.

For Descartes, the experience of understanding mathematics is the sole

means of understanding what “understanding” really means. It has an intensity
and bewildering uniqueness that acts on us like a revelation. Mathematics is a
spiritual awakening. It teaches us to recognize the correct physical sensation,
that which will guide us on the path to knowledge. And until we have personally
encountered this crystalline and translucid form of truth, it is impossible to know
what it means for a thing to be “clear and distinct,” it is impossible to understand
what Descartes is trying to tell us, and, according to him, it is impossible to enter
into a real approach to knowledge.

Toward 1628 he began writing _Rules for the Direction of the Mind,_ his first

attempt to lay out his method. This text, which Descartes never chose to publish,
prefigures _Discourse on Method,_ which he would write nearly ten years later.

In it, he presents official mathematics as an “outer garment” that must be

removed before its real substance can be accessed: “I would not value these
Rules so highly if they were good only for solving those pointless problems with
which arithmeticians and geometers are inclined to while away their time, for in
that case all I could credit myself with achieving would be to dabble in trifles


-----

with greater subtlety than they.”

Descartes contrasts what he calls the “true mathematics” with the “childish

and pointless” stuff you find in textbooks. In his own effort to learn arithmetic
and geometry, Descartes had grown frustrated at the disconnect: “In neither
subject did I come across writers who fully satisfied me. I read much about
numbers which I found to be true once I had gone over the calculations for
myself. The writers displayed many geometrical truths before my very eyes, as it
were, and derived them by means of logical arguments. But they did not seem to
make it sufficiently clear to my mind why these things should be so and how
they were discovered.”

The ancient Greek philosophers granted a special place to mathematics. They

made it the prerequisite of all philosophy and science. Legend has it that the
following phrase was engraved at the entry to Plato’s Academy: “Let no one
ignorant of geometry enter.”

For Descartes, this wouldn’t have made any sense if the ancient Greeks had

only known about the “childish and pointless” stuff. They must necessarily have
been acquainted with the “true mathematics”: “I came to suspect that they were
familiar with a kind of mathematics quite different from the one which prevails
today.”

Descartes even has an explanation as to why this special kind of math wasn’t

passed on to us. According to him, the ancient Greeks intentionally chose to
keep it secret, because it was too easy and too simple, and disclosing it would
have damaged their intellectual prestige:

I have come to think that these writers themselves, with a kind of pernicious cunning, later
suppressed this mathematics as, notoriously, many inventors are known to have done where their
own discoveries were concerned. They may have feared that their method, just because it was so
easy and simple, would be depreciated if it were divulged; so to gain our admiration, they may have
shown us, as the fruits of their method, some barren truths proved by clever arguments, instead of
teaching us the method itself, which might have dispelled our admiration.

## Reconnecting with the Truth within Us

_Rules for the Direction of the Mind_ is a visionary text that anticipates the

themes that we’ve addressed from the outset of this book. Descartes even
formulated this profound truth, which seems so modern, that the principal
objects stopping us are psychological stumbling blocks.

His approach is deeply meditative. To recover the path of this ancient

knowledge, he invites us to reconnect with our primitive lucidity, the “primary
seeds of truth naturally implanted in human minds [that] thrived vigorously in


-----

that unsophisticated and innocent age—seeds which have been stifled in us
through our constantly reading and hearing all sorts of errors.”

He notes that the difficulty is of an emotional and nonintellectual order. It

arises from our social need to make believe, for others as for ourselves, that we
understand what in reality we do not. It’s a bit like the Fosbury flop: to adopt the
correct position, you have to overcome the flight reflex that makes us believe
that we’re putting ourselves in danger. We have to rid ourselves of our false
understanding and our tendencies to bluff.

This instinct for dissimulation particularly affects intellectuals: “Because

they have thought it unbecoming for a man of learning to admit to being ignorant
on any matter, they have got so used to elaborating their contrived doctrines that
they have gradually come to believe them and to pass them off as true.”

Our insecurity is such that we’ve abandoned the idea that real understanding

is even possible. Because we refuse to believe that it could really be simple, we
look for knowledge in the opposite direction, in the complicated and difficult.

Descartes realized how much his recommendations went against our

instincts, so he took care to hammer home the message:

We can have no knowledge without mental intuition or deduction.

The whole method consists entirely in the ordering and arranging of the objects on which we must
concentrate our mind’s eye if we are to discover some truth.

We shall be following this method exactly if we first reduce complicated and obscure propositions
step by step to simpler ones, and then, starting with the intuition of the simplest ones of all, try to
ascend through the same steps to a knowledge of all the rest.

But many people either do not reflect upon what the Rule prescribes, or ignore it altogether, or
presume that they have no need of it . . . as if they were trying to get from the bottom to the top of a
building at one bound, spurning or failing to notice the stairs designed for that purpose.

If in the series of things to be examined we come across something which our intellect is unable to
intuit sufficiently well, we must stop at that point.

## “My candour will be appreciated by everyone”

What the _Rules_ didn’t make explicit, however, was that Descartes was

confronted with a major problem. This problem is central to his philosophy, and
yet he was never able to resolve it: he had tried this method himself, he knew
that it worked, but he could never explain why.

It’s a problem that all mathematicians face, and one we’ve already discussed.


-----

It’s difficult to talk about the unseen actions that we make in our heads. It’s
difficult to describe the method in tangible terms that others will make sense of.
It’s difficult to find a rational explanation for the fact that it works. The
vocabulary that we possess to share our mental experiences is so poor that we
rather quickly give the impression of saying whatever, nothing but smoke and
mirrors.

And honestly, it’s hard to take Descartes seriously when he speaks of the

“Spirit of Truth” descending to take possession of him, or the “primary seeds of
truth naturally implanted in human minds.” It is, however, the only explanation
that he was in a position to give. This lead him to adopt a _dualist_ stance: he
imagined a separation between mind and body. Our mind is of an immaterial
nature, created by God in his image, and thus capable of attaining Truth as if by
magic.

You can think what you like of this belief, but you can’t take it for granted.

At any rate, it’s not at the level of rigor that Descartes aspired to impose upon
himself: to accept as true only that which is so evident that it’s impossible to
doubt.

From a distance, you can see the extent of the problem. An explanation

based on neuroplasticity was impossible to formulate in the seventeenth century.
In Descartes’s time, knowledge of the human body was rather limited. He
himself thought of the heart as a furnace that served to heat the blood. At the
time, medical practice still dressed itself in the guise of a carnival show before
proceeding with enemas and bloodletting.

Among the great mathematicians in history, Descartes is far from being the

only one to give a supernatural explanation for creativity. In the _Key to Dreams,_
a mystic text that he wrote after _Harvests and Sowings,_ Grothendieck says that
God came to dream inside of him to show him the truth.

Srinivasa Ramanujan, whom we’ll talk more of at the end of the book, said

that his theorems were revealed to him by his family goddess Namagiri Thayar,
a recurring character in his dreams.

I admit that these explanations have always left me a bit skeptical. We’ll

come back to them in the final chapters.

It’s perhaps because he suspected he’d have a hard time convincing others

that Descartes abandoned _Rules for the Direction of the Mind._

Rather than directly stating his method, he chose to put it in practice. He

pursued research in mathematics, physics, and biology. He traveled across
Europe. He spent a number of years in Amsterdam, in the butchers’ district,
which gave him access to animal cadavers for dissection. Anatomy was one of


-----

his primary interests.

By the early 1630s, Descartes was readying an ambitious _Treatise on the_

_World_ that was to explain all natural phenomena.

But something happened that called the whole plan into question. In

February 1633, Galileo was convicted of heresy and placed under house arrest
for having defended Copernicus’s theories.

Descartes, who never joked about his personal security, halted his research

and the publication of his treatise. This same preoccupation with security had
already led to his self-exile in the Netherlands, a Protestant nation and thus
outside the reach of the Inquisition.

He resolved to pursue a partial publication, rather than a complete one,

which would almost have guaranteed a conviction. He extracted from his treatise
those chapters least likely to cause problems.

_A Discourse on the Method of Correctly Conducting One’s Reason and of_

_Seeking Truth in the Sciences_ is Descartes’s introduction to the collection he
published, anonymously, in 1637. The three short treatises that followed this
introduction ( _Geometry,_ the mathematical treatise we already mentioned, _Optics,_
whose title is self-explanatory, and _Meteors,_ which sought to explain phenomena
such as wind, lightning, and rainbows) are presented as proof of the
effectiveness of his method.

As opposed to _Rules for the Direction of the Mind,_ written in an extremely

preemptory and authoritative style, _Discourse on Method_ begins in a strikingly
modest fashion.

Descartes seemed to have realized that his story was a bit much and that

people might have a hard time swallowing it. He didn’t seem to completely
believe it himself. From the opening pages of his book, he confessed that there
was something of a contradiction. On the one hand, he was well aware of the
utmost importance of his scientific work. In that respect, he didn’t suffer from
false modesty. On the other hand, it seemed to him that he wasn’t particularly
gifted.

He drew the conclusion that his success could only be explained by the

method he had come across by chance. He recognized, however, that this might
seem too good to be true:

It is, however, possible that I am wrong, and that I am mistaking bits of copper and glass for gold
and diamonds. I know how likely we are to be wrong on our own account. . . . So my aim here is
not to teach the method that everyone must follow for the right conduct of his reason, but only to
show in what way I have tried to conduct mine.


-----

In short, he wasn’t there to give us lessons. Like _Harvests and Sowings,_

_Discourse on Method_ is an autobiography, a testimonial that we shouldn’t
necessarily take at face value: “I hope that it may prove useful to some people
without being harmful to any, and that my candour will be appreciated by
everyone.”

## Visceral Doubt

Descartes’s doubt is a bit like Ben Underwood’s clicking: people find it so

hard to believe that it works that they don’t even bother trying, or they give up
before it’s started to work.

Outside of the mathematical community, I don’t believe I’ve ever come

across anyone who has really taken doubt seriously.

What a waste! A great mathematician takes the trouble to tell us how he got

there despite being what he deemed as of average intelligence. He set down in
black and white that his account has no theoretical basis but should be taken as a
source of “examples worthy of imitation.” Generations of students have been
beaten over the head and forced to regard the _Discourse_ as a philosophical
treatise. And almost no one has taken the trouble to try it _for real._

Before ending this chapter, let’s take the time to clarify what Cartesian doubt

really is, and the personal benefits everyone can get from it. After all, this is the
best possible introduction to another key concept that up to now we’ve only
begun to address: the concept of the _mathematical proof._

At school we’re taught that Cartesian doubt is a _methodical doubt._ It’s a way

of saying that the method is based on doubt. But this expression can lead to
confusion. It’s easy to take it the wrong way, thinking that you have to doubt in a
methodical fashion. That’s completely impossible, for the same reason that it’s
impossible to fall in love in a methodical fashion. You can only doubt with your
gut. All Cartesian doubt is visceral.

Wanting to doubt in a methodical fashion is to confuse System 2, mechanical

thinking, with System 3, the dialogue between intuition and logic.

Descartes wasn’t against System 2. For example, he recommended making

lists so that you don’t forget anything. But the process of doubt doesn’t belong to
System 2. You can’t doubt with words, you can doubt only silently, in your
head. Doubt is personal and intimate. If you only pretend to doubt, if you don’t
go all the way, if you don’t take the plunge, it’s worth nothing.

In inventing doubt, Descartes positioned himself in opposition to official

knowledge. He lived in a world where truth was still conflated with authority:


-----

truth was tradition, what was written in books. The sciences were still the heirs
of the Aristotelean approach, over two thousand years old. That approach
consisted of compiling and trying to structure a hodgepodge of things supposed
to be 99 percent true (or that someone supposedly serious had said were 99
percent true, or 80 percent, or 51 percent—you never really knew).

For example, when Aristotle explained why the Earth was round, he amassed

a bunch of mixed arguments taken from other sources. The more arguments
there were, the more convincing it was supposed to be, up to the point where he
quietly explains that there are elephants in Africa and elephants in Asia,
therefore the two ends meet, and therefore the Earth is round.

To doubt is to give an argument the sniff test and sense that there’s

something off. It’s allowing yourself to ask, “What? Really?”

Descartes’s position is really quite simple: he states that what is probable,

even 99.99 percent sure but not 100 percent, might be interesting, but from a
scientific perspective it’s worth nothing, because you can’t build on it. (As we’ll
see, this is an extreme view that, in its purest form, is highly problematic.
Modern science is in fact built on things that are very likely yet not 100 percent
certain, and there are good reasons to proceed this way.)

Teaching Cartesian doubt is difficult because it’s neither a knowledge nor a

mode of argumentation, and is therefore impossible to evaluate. No one can
doubt on a piece of paper. Doubt is a secret motor activity, an unseen action. To
doubt something is to be able to imagine a scenario, even seemingly improbable,
where the thing could be untrue.

Descartes asks us to doubt not only what others say, but also, and above all,

our own certitudes. This is at the heart of his method, and it’s where we have the
hardest time following him. To place in doubt our own certitudes is like doing a
high jump headfirst and on your back: our instinct tells us it’s dangerous. We’re
afraid of exposing our physical vulnerabilities, of foundering, of falling into a
bottomless pit where we’ll no longer have confidence in anything. And we
absolutely don’t see what we stand to gain from it.

If you’ve never really experienced math, you’ll have a tendency to believe

it’s a bottomless pit. The level of certainty demanded by Descartes seems
impossible to attain.

Mathematics gives us examples of truths in which we can have absolute

confidence. It’s not just about superficial truths, like 2 + 2 = 4, but also profound
truths, truths that are extremely interesting and not at all immediately apparent.
We’ll give several striking examples in the next chapter.

It’s only through a relentless confrontation with doubt that forces you to


-----

clarify and specify each detail until it all becomes transparent that you’re finally
able to _create_ obviousness. Doubt is a technique of mental clarification. It serves
to construct rather than destroy.

## “An attitude of curiosity that excludes all fear”

Outside of mathematics, the level of certainty required by Descartes turns out

to be impossible to attain for profound reasons that relate to how language and
our brains function, and that have only recently been understood (we’ll come
back to this later).

That takes nothing away from the strength and potency of Cartesian doubt.

The message of personal development in _Discourse on Method_ goes well beyond
the field of mathematics and the search for eternal truths.

This message makes sense only in light of Descartes’s personality and his

motivations. He hated “those sceptics who doubt for doubting’s sake, and
pretend to be always unable to reach a decision.” His “burning desire,” as we’ve
seen, was the exact opposite: “to proceed with confidence through life.”

His approach to doubt is closely tied to his taste for intuition, which he

defined as “the conception of a clear and attentive mind, which is so easy and
distinct that there can be no room for doubt.”

Doubt thus corresponds to the shadow zones of intuition. To really doubt

something, you can’t just claim that you doubt, you have to sincerely believe
that this thing might not be true. In order to do that, you have to construct an
image in your head that shows there’s a place for doubt. If you can’t do that, you
can’t doubt—you’re certain, like you can be with 2 + 2 = 4. But once you’re able
to imagine a scenario where the thing can be untrue, doubt immediately starts the
process of reconfiguring your mental representations.

Because it mobilizes the imagination, the Cartesian version of doubt

resembles techniques described in the previous chapters, except that instead of
being concerned with numbers or geometric forms, it’s concerned with truth
itself.

Cartesian doubt is a universal technique for reprogramming your intuition.
It’s therefore not surprising to find in Descartes’s writing very similar advice

to that given by Grothendieck and Thurston. He asks us, for example, for total
physical commitment in service of our cognitive development: “We must make
use of all the aids which intellect, imagination, sense-perception, and memory
afford in order, firstly, to intuit simple propositions distinctly.”

Descartes never speaks explicitly of mental plasticity. This notion would be


-----

conceptualized only many centuries after his death. But his account of the
benefits of his method doesn’t leave much room for ambiguity: “I believed that,
in practising it, my mind was gradually getting used to conceiving of its objects
more clearly and distinctly.”

Descartes discovered that when we make a sincere attempt at introspection,

when we’re attentive to our cognitive dissonance, when we force ourselves to
grasp our most fleeting mental images and put words to them, when we have the
courage to face the internal contradictions of our imagination, when we have
enough calm and self-control to look beyond our prejudices and see things as
they really are, it has the result of modifying our mental representations, of
making them more powerful, solid, coherent, and effective.

What Descartes discovered is a property of the human body.
The preeminence of the vocabulary of vision in Descartes is in this instance

striking. When he states that truth is that which is “clear and distinct,” you could
almost say that he’s giving it a neurological definition. His method evokes that
of Thurston and Ben Underwood: it’s a method for learning to see.

Practiced right, doubt can induce a state of profound comprehension that

amazed Descartes, as it amazes all those who experience it. It’s an experience
that leaves you transformed, and that in itself is well worth the effort.

Doubt is not only the secret behind Descartes’s achievements, it’s also the

secret of his incredible chutzpah. Seen in this way, _Discourse on Method_ is a
master class in self-confidence. His version of rationality is concrete, personal,
rooted in our deepest aspirations. The whole point is to make us stronger: “This
**assurance** is one side of a mindset, whose other side is an **openness to doubt:**
an attitude of curiosity that excludes all fear as regards one’s own mistakes, that
allows us to detect and constantly correct them.”

This last quote, taken from Grothendieck’s _Harvests and Sowings_ , perfectly

summarizes this fundamental lesson from Descartes, and captures a unique
aspect of the mathematical ethos.

Arrogant people who love being contradicted, show-offs who smile when

you prove them wrong, dogmatists ready to change their mind in a heartbeat:
I’ve encountered this singular attitude only among very good mathematicians.

 Awe and Magic

If the mental actions of mathematicians were visible, research institutes

would have glass walls. Passersby would stop to look, as they would at people
who are kitesurfing or rock climbing. In high school, mathematics would be
more popular than skateboarding.

In losing the possibility of imitation, we lose much more than our main

learning method. We also lose our main driver of desire.

When you were a child, no one needed to make you want to ride a bike. No

one had to convince you that it would serve you well later on in life, or that it
would look good on your CV.

These questions never crossed your mind. You’d seen other kids riding

bikes. You liked it and you wanted to do the same.

The principles of physics that govern the movement of bicycles have been

known since 1687 and Isaac Newton’s publication of _Philosophiae Naturalis_
_Principia Mathematica,_ the groundbreaking treatise in which he introduced both
universal gravitation and the inertia principle. The bicycle wouldn’t be invented
until two centuries later. If you’d given one to Newton for his birthday, he would
have refused to ride it. Most likely, he would have found the whole idea dumb
and dangerous. He might even have gone so far as _proving_ that it’s physically
impossible to keep your balance on a bicycle. But if you had shown him how, he
would have been intrigued.

## A Recipe for Mathematical Desire

If I could show it, the math that goes on in my head would intrigue a lot of

people. But it serves no purpose to say so, since I don’t have any means of
showing it.

When I try to get people interested in math, I approach it differently. Rather


-----

than talking about what interests me personally, I choose the most accessible
subjects and focus on re-creating the right emotional journey. After all, this is
what got me interested in the first place: an emotional trigger, a very childish
one, as when someone “dared” me and I didn’t want to admit that I was scared.

I remember clearly how I felt the first time that I saw people kitesurfing.

What I was seeing didn’t seem at all possible. But at the same time—well, it was
apparently possible. I ended up watching it for a long time.

Something similar intrigued me when I got started in math. It seemed too

hard, too abstract, too incomprehensible. It didn’t seem that doing math was
humanly possible. And at the same time, it was apparently possible.

The difficulty of math, the initial shock, is only the first part of the emotional

journey. The second part is the incredible feeling of wonder that arises from
deep understanding, once you discover that not only is it possible, it is even
easy. It was easy from the beginning, except that you couldn’t see it.

Awe and then magic: this is a potent recipe for mathematical desire and a

great complement to the sanitized math from the curriculum. Math isn’t for the
faint of heart. When we hide how scary it can be, we make it less desirable. If it
wasn’t for the awe, there would be no magic.

## Measuring Infinity

A good subject for popularizing math is one that allows you to experience

awe and then magic without getting burdened down with specialized techniques
and language. In that respect, the discoveries of Georg Cantor (1845–1918) are
perfect.

The concept of infinity goes back to the dawn of time and, for millennia, it

had symbolized the unthinkable. You could talk at length about infinity, but only
with a dignified composure and grandiloquent tone. It was a cool way of saying
nothing while sounding profound. You were not allowed to talk about infinity in
a casual and precise manner, in the same way you would talk about the number 5
or a straight line that intersects a circle at two points.

Being casual and precise when talking about infinity was like going to the

Moon: it was the perfect example of something humankind would never achieve.
Up until the day that Cantor found out he could do it. Even more incredible is
that more than a century after such a spectacular discovery, most people haven’t
even heard about it.

When I meet someone who doesn’t know there are many sizes of infinity,

it’s almost the same as meeting someone who doesn’t know you can count


-----

beyond 5. It gives me a chance to share the news.

Take a grid that stretches to infinity. I’ll only draw a bit of it, but you’ll see

what I’m talking about: a piece of grid paper that goes to infinity on all sides.

In this infinite grid, there are an infinity of white boxes. People generally

understand this statement, which they find simple and concrete.

On an infinite straight line, there are also an infinite number of points. That’s

also generally clear to everyone. Everybody can picture this drawing as well.

_Are there more boxes in the grid than points on the line? Is it the same_

_number in each? Are there more points on the line than boxes in the grid?_

I’ve heard people sneer at these questions. They were convinced that

speaking about infinity was something reserved for mystics and theologians.
Their typical reactions: “The question doesn’t make any sense” and “Infinity
doesn’t exist.”

You can’t have it both ways: if infinity doesn’t exist, then straight lines don’t

exist, or they only have a finite number of points. Mathematical abstractions
exist neither more nor less than other abstractions we manipulate. Does the color
red really exist? Do electrons really exist? Do justice and freedom really exist?
In chapter 18 we’ll talk about the insurmountable practical difficulties raised by


-----

a concept as pragmatic and concrete as that of an _elephant:_ in a sense, elephants
don’t really exist. That absolutely doesn’t stop us from talking about elephants,
or from asking precise questions about them and providing answers to these
questions.

Cantor realized that the language of sets allows you to give precise answers

to questions about infinity.

The concept of sets is very old. It had been used since ancient times,

informally, without anyone objecting to it or taking the time to look at it more
closely. You could speak of “the set of houses on my street” or “the set of apples
in front of you” or “the set of whole numbers” and everyone understood what it
meant. The word was part of everyday speech and wasn’t seen as a mathematical
concept.

Building on the intuitive idea of what constitutes a set, Cantor created a

simple and expressive mathematical vocabulary. His definitions are no more
complicated than our theory of touch in chapter 8 . Thanks to this vocabulary, it’s
possible to give a very precise meaning to the questions we asked above and
provide a response as surprising as it is clear:

Theorem: There are more points in the straight line than there are boxes in the grid.

Most strikingly, the whole thing, from the initial definitions to the theorem’s

proof, can be explained in under an hour to a curious primary school student. In
other words, the solution of a problem that was deemed not just _unsolvable_ but
actually _unthinkable_ was right before our eyes. It had been there since the
beginning of time, less than an hour away from us.

I’m not joking: I’ve really explained it, over coffee, to the children of friends

who’d invited me to lunch, and it really interested them.

Here’s a rough outline of the proof, in a short and incomplete version. The

infinity of boxes in the grid is said to be _countable:_ you can number all the boxes
with whole numbers (for example, by starting with a random box and numbering
it as 1, then numbering the surrounding boxes as 2 through 9, and so on,
numbering by successive nested squares up to infinity). Cantor discovered that,
to the contrary, the straight line is _uncountable:_ the infinity of its points is so
large that you can’t number them all using whole numbers. To prove that he
used a process that today is called _Cantor’s diagonal argument._

Rather than trying to explain the details to you in writing (you can find them

on Wikipedia), I’d rather let you find someone who can explain it to you in
person. As we’ve seen in chapter 6 , direct communication is spectacularly more


-----

efficient than reading. Follow the advice in chapter 13 and force yourself to ask
all the stupid questions that come to mind: I guarantee that you’ll have some.

Cantor himself was shocked by what he had discovered. He thought that it

had been directly sent to him from God. As regards one of his most unexpected
results ( _there are as many points in a line as in a plane_ ), he admitted in a letter
to one of his friends, “I see it, but I don’t believe it!”

Cantor’s results were so new and groundbreaking that he had to face the

incredulity of his contemporaries. An influential mathematician labeled him a
“scientific charlatan,” a “renegade,” a “corruptor of youth.” When he submitted
one of his articles to a leading scientific journal, the editor implored him to
withdraw it because, he said, it came “about one hundred years too soon.”

At the end of his life, undermined by all the controversies, Cantor sank into a

deep depression. He spent his final years in sanatoriums and died in poverty.

His ideas finally prevailed. Since the early twentieth century, the concept of

sets has become central in mathematics. For someone of my generation, trying to
imagine doing math without sets is like trying to imagine life without electricity.

## Grasping at Knots

When I want to explain what a mathematical proof is, what purpose it serves,

and the special flavor of certitudes that you can construct _through the power of_
_thought,_ I like to use examples taken from knot theory.

In mathematics, a _knot_ is a manner of joining the two ends of a string. For

example, you can tie two ends of a string together in what is called a _trefoil knot._

The string is presumed to be elastic and unbreakable: as long as you don’t

untie it, you can play with it as much as you like without changing the knot. For
example, you can start with a string tied into a trefoil knot as above, and play
with it to get this:


-----

It’s still a trefoil knot, just drawn differently. If you don’t immediately see

how you get from the first drawing to the second, if that gives you a bit of a
headache, do not worry. It’s normal. If it makes things easier, you can try it with
an actual piece of string.

The simplest way to tie a string together is in a _trivial knot,_ or an _unknot_ , as

follows:

In a way, the unknot is the “zero” of knots; it is a knot that isn’t really

knotted. You can draw it differently, for example:

It’s clear enough visually that the string isn’t really knotted, and that it’s still

the unknot. But there are other ways of drawing a trivial knot where it’s not at all
evident at first glance that you’re dealing with an unknot. You can draw one, for
example, like this:


-----

Can you untangle this drawing in your mind, without the aid of a string or

pen and paper? Despite my solid training in manipulating these kinds of things,
it took me a while to figure out how to do it. If you can do it in a few minutes,
without any special training, bravo! Once you get it the first time, it gets much
easier to do it again.

To be honest, this example approaches the limits of my capacity for

visualization. And these limits are greatly surpassed when it comes to mentally
untangling a much more complicated drawing of an unknot, like this:

I don’t know whether there are people really able to mentally untangle this

kind of thing, to find it visually “obvious” that it’s just the unknot. The idea
terrifies me and even thinking about it gives me a headache.

It’s precisely because it’s hard to see that two different drawings represent

the same knot that knot theory is an interesting subject.


-----

Once you realize that there are an infinite number of ways, more or less

complicated, to draw the same knot, you also realize that nothing guarantees that
two knots drawn differently are in fact different. An initial legitimate question is,
for example: _Is the trefoil knot really different from the unknot?_

In other words: can you take a string knotted like a trefoil and twist it to undo

the knot, without cutting the string, and lay it on a table so that it forms a circle?

If you try it, you’ll quickly get the impression that it’s not possible.

Experimentally, you would say that a trefoil is not the same thing as an unknot.

I like this example because it’s a perfect illustration of Cartesian doubt and

the radical difference between an _impression_ and a _mathematical proof._

It’s worthwhile to really try playing with a string for ten minutes, asking

yourself the following question: what’s your level of certainty that a trefoil knot
really _is_ different from a trivial knot—50 percent? 80 percent? 99 percent? 99.99
percent? Can you honestly say that there is no room for doubt?

I’ll ask the question more bluntly: would you, _for real,_ bet your life on it?
What guarantee do you have that there’s not some winding road, some trick

out of nowhere, that would allow you to go from a trefoil knot to the unknot?

It’s like with those puzzles that seem unsolvable. If you have the solution,

you know for sure there’s a solution. But if you don’t have the solution, you
don’t know whether there isn’t one, or that you just haven’t found it yet.

We all have the impression that a trefoil knot is different from an unknot, but

the existence of complicated drawings of an unknot shows us that we can’t
always rely on our first impressions. Because a string looks like it’s completely
tangled up doesn’t mean that it is really tangled up.

You could imagine that it’s possible to untangle a trefoil knot and get back to

an unknot by a series of maneuvers so complicated that no human has yet
figured out how to do it.

At first glance, it thus seems impossible to be 100 percent sure about

something. You’d have to consider the infinity of all possible ways of twisting
the string. Even if you spent a billion years playing with the string, you could try
only a finite number of combinations.


-----

The beauty of mathematical reasoning is to be capable of manipulating

objects as evanescent as knots and give answers of which you’re 100 percent
sure to questions that at first seem impossible to answer with that degree of
certainty.

By “evanescent objects” I mean those objects that don’t appear to be made to

be rigorously manipulated by language. A knotted string is not like a whole
number. It doesn’t resemble something that you can tie up in equations. It’s not
something you feel able to capture in words.

With a trefoil knot, it does seem like the string is knotted and that you can’t

unknot it without cutting it. But you’d be hard pressed to say where exactly
along the string the knot is situated. It’s not at a specific place you can put your
finger on. You sense the presence of the knot, but you can never really “grasp”
it.

When I was a student, I was shocked to discover that it’s possible to _grasp_

_knots with language_ and to give a complete proof, 100 percent certain, of this
result:

Theorem: A trefoil knot is distinct from an unknot.

A proof of this theorem is outlined in the “Notes and Further Reading”

section at the end of the book.

## Stacking Oranges

It would be a lie to pretend that all mathematical proofs can be explained

simply to nonspecialists.

The easiest problems to ask are sometimes the most difficult to solve. There

are any number of problems that are easy to ask that we have no idea how to
answer. There are even problems that are easy to ask that we know how to solve
only with extremely complicated solutions, and for which there seems to be no
easy answer.

Kepler’s conjecture is a perfect example. It provides a tentative answer to the

following question: _What is the best way to stack oranges?_

The great astronomer and mathematician Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) had

an intuition for the solution in 1611 without, however, being able to prove that it
was correct. As we’ve seen, a statement that you think is true but for which you
can’t give a rigorous proof is what mathematicians call a _conjecture._

In Kepler’s time, oranges were a luxury. He stated the problem in terms of


-----

cannonballs. But obviously that doesn’t change the answer.

To be more precise, the question is about oranges presumed to be perfect

spheres, all of the same size. If you tried to fill a space entirely with these
oranges, how should you stack them to achieve maximum density?

With identical cubes, you can easily fill up the entire space without leaving

any gaps, and get a density of 100 percent. But that’s not possible with spheres.

At the market, fruit sellers usually stack oranges in a pyramid.
With this pattern, the density is about 74.05 percent: the space is filled about

74.05 percent with oranges, with about 25.95 percent of space lost between the
oranges. Kepler’s conjecture states that this is the maximum density and that
there’s no way of stacking the oranges that would be more dense.

Intuitively, that seems credible enough. But “credible enough” isn’t what

mathematicians call a proof.

For more than two centuries, no one made any progress. Gauss made the first

breakthrough: in 1831 he proved that if you require that the oranges be arranged
in a regular, repeating pattern, like atoms in a crystal, then the fruit seller’s way
of stacking the oranges is the densest possible.

It’s a spectacular result but it doesn’t totally prove Kepler’s conjecture. A

priori, it doesn’t exclude that there might exist a very bizarre way, with no
regularity, of stacking a hundred thousand billion oranges that would be denser
than stacking them regularly.

Personally, I have no idea how you might approach such a problem. It makes

my mind spin.


-----

After Gauss’s breakthrough, it would be another 150 years before Kepler’s

conjecture would be entirely solved. The first complete solution was given in
1998 by Tom Hales, an American mathematician born in 1958.

The conjecture thus remained open for 387 years. After such a long wait,

habits are hard to break. Some people continue to say “Kepler’s conjecture” for
the result itself, whereas one really should say “Hales’s theorem.”

I’m completely unable to explain Hales’s proof to a primary school student

—or anyone else, for that matter—given that I’ve never looked at it closely and
it would take me years of work to try to understand it.

In September 1998 Tom Hales submitted it to _Annals of Mathematics,_ one of

the most prestigious math journals. Before being accepted for publication, a
scientific article is normally sent to one or two anonymous referees to check on
its validity. Hales’s proof was so difficult that _Annals of Mathematics_ had to
send it for evaluation to a committee of _twelve_ referees.

It was even necessary to organize international conferences whose sole aim

was to try to understand the proof. After four years, the chair of the refereeing
committee affirmed that the committee members were “99% certain” of the
validity of the proof: not bad, but still far from theorem grade. The article was
finally accepted in August 2005, nearly seven years after it had been submitted.

An unusual feature of Hales’s proof is that it is partly computer based: while


-----

an abstract mathematical reasoning allowed Hales to cover the general case, it
left aside a finite number of possible exceptions that had to be studied separately.
These millions of special configurations could be addressed only by brute force.
It is this mixture of deep mathematics and massive computations that made the
proof so difficult to assess. To this day no human has been able to prove
Kepler’s conjecture through the power of thought alone.

Kepler’s conjecture bears on the piling of spheres in three dimensions, but

the question of the optimal stacking of spheres could be posed in any dimension.
As we mentioned in chapter 9 , it is possible to do geometry in dimension _n_ for
any whole number _n._

In two dimensions, the problem is easy enough to solve. A sphere in two

dimensions is a circle. The problem thus becomes one of the densest way to
arrange coins on a table. The optimal solution is shown in the figure.

This result is in fact much easier to prove than the version in three

dimensions.

Nothing is stopping you from trying to look _beyond_ three dimensions. If

you’ve never done geometry in higher dimensions, it’s a bit intimidating to
admit to yourself that there are people brave enough to take on these kinds of
questions.

When it takes nearly four hundred years to solve a problem in three

dimensions, you’d think you’d have to wait quite a while to see it solved for
higher dimensions.

The solution still isn’t known in four dimensions. Nor in five, six, or seven

dimensions.

This is why the results of Maryna Viazovska, a Ukrainian mathematician


-----

born in 1984, created such surprise. In 2016, she began by solving the problem
in eight dimensions using new and very elegant techniques. This already was a
spectacular result. Three months later, along with four collaborators, she used a
similar approach to solve the problem in twenty-four dimensions. For these
breakthroughs, she received the Fields Medal in 2022.

These are for now the only dimensions above three for which the answer is

known.

Why can we solve the problem in eight and twenty-four dimensions, but not

in four or five? The explanation is that in eight and twenty-four dimensions, an
unusual phenomenon takes place. There are exceptional mathematical objects,
specific to these dimensions, that give rise to incredibly dense and harmonious
ways of stacking the spheres. In twenty-four dimensions, the stacking is so dense
that each sphere is in contact with 196,560 neighboring spheres.

I began this chapter by speaking of awe and magic. To characterize my

personal reaction to the news that it is humanly possible to describe the best way
of stacking spheres in twenty-four dimensions, _awe_ is an accurate word. I
haven’t yet experienced the _magic_ of understanding the proof myself, but I’m
content enough with the joy that someone else did.

I imagine that for you the idea of twenty-four dimensions is already

vertiginous in itself. The beauty of mathematics is that this vertigo can be
overcome.

Nothing is stopping you from understanding what twenty-four dimensions

really means, nor from understanding the usefulness of doing geometry in these
types of spaces. There are practical uses for all this: the geometry of stacking


-----

spheres in twenty-four dimensions was most notably used in the datatransmission protocols for the Voyager 1 and 2 probes, sent by NASA outside of
the solar system. The basics of geometry in higher dimensions is intellectually
within your grasp. You can learn them in a few weeks. The most difficult thing
is overcoming your fear.

Proving theorems like those of Tom Hales and Maryna Viazovska is

obviously not within reach of everyone. However, getting to experience some of
the awe and some of the magic is much more accessible, at the expense of an
effort that in the end isn’t so much.

Twenty-four-dimensional oranges can also be used to make another

important point. Until recently, it was quite common to hear that women were
biologically incapable of doing geometry. They were supposed to lack the ability
to visualize objects in space, which made them incapable of even reading a road
map. Next time you hear that kind of stuff, feel free to bring up Maryna
Viazovska.

## 16
 Hyperlucidity

My earliest memory of a deliberate and sustained effort to imagine

something goes back to when I was seven. One night in bed, after having turned
off the light and closed my eyes, I realized that with a bit of effort I could
imagine seeing my favorite cartoon.

I didn’t speak about it to anyone.
I remember like it was yesterday the amazement I felt and how I described

the phenomenon to myself, in the words I used back then: it felt like I could
“watch TV in my head.”

I was able to visualize images and scenes I’d never seen. I was even able to

imagine new episodes. It made a big impression on me. I loved it, so of course I
continued doing it.

The transition between waking and sleep, as well as sleepiness upon

awakening, have since that time played a central role in my intellectual
development. In every project I begin, once it gets serious, once I really get
interested, once I’m confronted with a real challenge, it starts to occupy that
liminal space.

Transcribing my dreams was my first real attempt at writing. I was about

seventeen when I started to get interested in this. At first, I found it too hard to
directly write down my dreams, so I tried to record them while saying them
aloud. My project was to collect them, like you would keep a journal or a photo
album.

But something unexpected happened that forced me to give up the project.

Night after night, as an effect of my trying to memorize them and put them into
words, my dreams grew in richness and precision.

I was dreaming better and better. I was dreaming so well that it started to

become annoying.

At first, I could remember only small fragments, bits and pieces of a single


-----

dream. But after two or three weeks, I was recounting five or six different
dreams every day, each with a complete story and enough details to fill up a lot
of pages with writing or long minutes of recordings.

It became overwhelming. The memories of my dreams were taking up too

much space in my head and in my days. I felt like this exercise in introspection
would end up consuming me.

Yet I continued to note them down, even after I’d stopped recording them. I

wasn’t looking for meaning in them. I just wanted to master the art of writing
them down.

To me, this is the essence of writing. Starting from images and sensations

and seeking a way to render them in words, to make them clear and solid.
Transcribing the situations, what’s at stake, how people and objects are
positioned in space, their actions and movements. Describing what you see and
feel as simply and faithfully as possible. Capturing the moods, the music, the
smells, the textures. If you can do that, you can do anything.

Writing down dreams, in my experience, is the closest you can get to

mathematical writing.

I’m always struck by the number of people who say they never remember

their dreams. Some say they never dream. That’s of course impossible. We all
dream, each night.

Remembering your dreams isn’t something you’re born with. It’s an ability

you develop through practice. There are techniques to begin and techniques to
get better. The more faithfully you learn to transcribe what you see, the more
you see.

For a long time I kept a notebook on my bedside table, with a pen in the

middle as a bookmark, to note down all my dreams and all the ideas that came to
me during the night. I even taught myself how to write in complete darkness.

When I stop writing down my dreams I quickly lose my ability to remember

them. When I force myself to write them down again, even if it’s just a word or
two, the ability gradually returns. Sometimes you have to keep it up for several
weeks. The most difficult part is trying to recapture the first bit of a dream after
a long period of not being able to do it.

As an adult, I’ve developed my own way of making use of the special state

of mind just before falling asleep. Rather than _focusing_ on subjects that
preoccupy me, I’ve learned to simply let myself _be filled with them._ The nuance
is subtle but fundamental. Focusing is thinking intensely, in search of solutions.
It never works and it keeps you from sleeping. Being filled with something
means contemplating it without a goal, in a decentered and disinterested manner.


-----

It’s almost like dreaming.

I might be wrong, but it seems to me that this technique of falling asleep

increases my chances of waking up the next morning with interesting ideas.

## From Another Point of View

Among my exercises of geometric imagination, my favorite one is done

during the phase of falling asleep.

Lying in my bed, eyes closed, I try to remember all the rooms I’ve slept in. I

imagine being in the room: the size and orientation of the bed, the location of the
walls and ceiling, doors and windows. I re-create the physical sensation of lying
down in one of these rooms from my past. I try to experience it with my entire
being. I choose the first room that comes to mind, then another, and another, and
another in no particular order other than that of inspiration. The most interesting
thing is when I recall a room that I had long forgotten.

I like this exercise because it’s easy and peaceful. It’s a great exercise for

beginners.

As I said in chapter 1 , I began early on to develop my intuitive perception of

space and geometry, without seeing the least relationship to the math I was being
taught at school.

It’s so long ago that I can no longer say exactly when it started. The period

when I was teaching myself to walk around with my eyes closed, memorizing
the position of the walls and objects, was the same time I was imagining
cartoons at night in bed.

I recall quite clearly my state of mind while I was doing those things. Early

on, in kindergarten, I had to wear glasses because I was nearsighted. In my
child’s imagination, I believed that being nearsighted was just the first step
toward becoming completely blind. I walked around with my eyes closed to train
myself for the day when I could no longer see.

That’s how I developed my capacity for visualization, and that’s how I

started learning geometry. Later on, I had the idea to use this capacity for
visualization to train myself to be able, on command, to look at the world from
another point of view.

I’m using the phrase “from another point of view” in a literal sense.
I was twelve years old when one day our art teacher asked us to draw our

pencil cases. I drew mine _seen from inside,_ with gigantic pens deformed by the
perspective. No one had taught me to draw using perspective, and yet it seemed
natural to me: I was simply drawing what I saw in my head.


-----

I was quite proud of this drawing and I remember it made a big impression

on my classmates.

Around the time I was fifteen we’d studied solid geometry in class, that is,

geometry in three dimensions. It was only then that I realized my capacity for
visualization differed from that of my friends. It’s perhaps the most surreal
memory of my school years.

The class content and the exercises seemed to me so completely useless that

they didn’t even make sense. It seemed like we were back in kindergarten. If the
teacher had simply put one finger in the air and asked us how many fingers we
saw, and we only had to answer, “One,” it would have made exactly the same
impression on me.

I got the best grade without understanding how it was possible not to

understand. But I knew from my friends that solid geometry was a frightening
subject for some of them. It gave them such difficulties that they were
embarrassed to talk about it.

I had no reason to suspect that my ability to _switch viewpoints_ was so

unusual. I was completely unaware of the extent of my geometric over-training.

If you want to practice _switching viewpoints,_ here is a good exercise:

1. Choose a random reference point around you, for example, the corner

opposite from you in a room, or the window of a house when you’re walking
in the street.

2. Try to imagine what you’d see if you were looking in your direction from this

reference point.

It’s not a binary exercise in which there are those who can and those who

can’t do it. The exercise is hard for everyone. At first, it seems like you’ll never
be able to see anything. But you necessarily see something: a vague shape, a
shadow or a blotch of light, or just a confused and fleeting idea. You have to
start there. The goal is to increase the clarity and the resolution of the picture,
while trying to maintain its presence for as long as possible.

I’ve tried a number of variations of this exercise. I’ve even tried completely

stupid things, things that were entirely undoable, just for fun.

At a time when I often took the train from Paris to La Rochelle, I tried to

visually memorize all of the countryside, always from the same side of the train
(the west side), and to reassemble it into a single image in my head. The
resulting image would have had to be huge: 150 feet high and 300 miles long. It
would have meant creating an image 10,000 times wider than it was tall and


-----

filling it entirely.

I never succeeded.

## Seeing the Unseen

After having used my imagination to “see” the world from other points of

view, I got into the habit of systematically trying to “see” all the things that were
supposed to be there, even though they weren’t visible.

Let me explain this with an example, that of soap bubbles.
A soap bubble is, in essence, the same thing as a balloon. The soapy water

forms an elastic membrane, which is inflated by the internal air pressure. This is
why the bubbles are spherical: to enclose a given volume of air, the sphere is the
shape with minimal surface area.

When a bubble forms, you can see it undulate for a few seconds before it

takes its spherical form. During this initial undulation, it’s quite easy to “sense”
that the surface of the bubble is elastic. The bubble undulates slowly, like a
balloon filled with water. We’re familiar with this movement, and as it takes
place it feels that we can “see” the physical properties of the bubble.

I’ve trained myself to continue to “see” the elasticity of the bubble once it

has taken its spherical shape. I’ve trained myself to “see” that the air inside the
bubble has a higher pressure than the air outside the bubble.

I’m placing quotation marks around “see” because I know that I can’t really

see it with my eyes. It’s visual, and yet at the same time it’s not really visual. I
wouldn’t be able to draw it. It’s just a weird sensation that is located within my
visual field, like if something had been highlighted. In a sense, you could say
that it’s a hallucination. But it’s an educated hallucination, one that’s constructed
and controlled.

When I look at a bridge, I see stress lines. I see which parts of the bridge are

subject to compression, and which ones are subject to tension.

I can call up these perceptions on command, with a bit of concentration.

They help me experience and understand the world.

You have similar sensations. You can “see” that a rope is stretched too

tightly and is about to break, or that a balloon is overinflated and is about to
burst. You’ve learned to “see” the tension of objects as if it was another layer of
augmented reality, supplementary information embedded in your visual field,
exactly like a color but located in another layer of reality.

These examples might seem too ordinary. Educating yourself to see more

and more of these types of things might seem childish and vain. Nevertheless, I


-----

have the feeling that it’s this approach, applied systematically throughout my
life, that has solidified my scientific understanding and allowed me to produce
original mathematical work.

That which I’m unable to “see” or “feel,” even when I know it should be

real, retains a special status for me. I don’t ignore the external information I get
through language, but I treat it as a _hypothesis,_ without entirely believing it.

If I don’t see why something should be true, I’m wary of it. This kind of

information can stay in this intermediate status for a long time. Maybe for a few
hours, days, weeks, years, or even decades.

Sometimes I suddenly “understand” things I was taught when I was a child,

and that had since then remained in this intermediate status.

In my class of high school geography, we were taught that deforestation led

to soil erosion. This information, which I received through language, without
visualization and without really understanding it, went completely over my head.
It didn’t interest me, and it didn’t convince me.

A decade later, I finally understood. I remember the moment quite well. I

was at a math conference, during a presentation where I was getting bored
because I couldn’t understand anything. I looked out the window at some trees. I
played at visualizing the scenery in its totality. I imagined the trees in their
entirety, down to their roots. And all of a sudden, it all made sense.

Visually, it was striking. The network of roots formed a structure that

retained the soil and the rocks, like rebar in reinforced concrete, creating a
composite structure with incredible strength. This explained why the soil wasn’t
sliding down along the hillside. It also explained another phenomenon I’d seen
before and that had struck me: of how unbelievably difficult it was to remove a
tree stump.

Another example: I knew that planes were able to fly, but a part of me

continued to refuse to believe it, because it didn’t seem normal, and I couldn’t
intuitively understand how it was possible.

This part of me came out when I was seated in a plane accelerating down the

runway for takeoff. A little voice inside me whispered something like, “It’s a
joke, this thing can’t fly, it’s way too heavy, we’ll never take off.”

I suspect that many people have heard this little voice inside their head, at

least once in their life. But they don’t dare admit to it, afraid that they’ll look like
fools.

We’re socially conditioned to find it normal that airplanes can take off, and

to laugh at the idea that someone could doubt it. But how many of us really
know how planes manage to fly?


-----

It’s not foolish to have doubts about the ability of planes to take off. It’s

simply proof of good sense and independence of mind.

My doubts never stopped me from boarding a plane. I didn’t go so far as to

deny the evidence. I could see that planes were able to fly. It was something that
I accepted, somewhat reluctantly, because I never had been offered a choice. I
accepted it from a practical standpoint but not from a sensory standpoint.

Of course, there are many more things I have to accept in this way than there

are things that I’m really capable of understanding.

It’s only been a few years since I’ve completely accepted the idea that

airplanes can fly. I learned how to feel it physically. In order to do so I had to
learn how to feel the density of the air and the phenomenon of lift. I had to find
out that airplanes are much lighter than they appear to be. I had to learn to feel
the wings, the way that they lift up and bend, their internal structure, how they
are attached to the fuselage and why they don’t break.

My intuition ended up finding all that normal. Planes became like an

extension of my body.

## In My Spine

Having confronted difficult mathematical subjects and made a career of it, I

developed a lot of confidence in my geometric intuition.

It comes into play notably about subjects most people don’t recognize as

being geometric in nature. For example, when I learned of the discovery of
_Homo floresiensis,_ then Denisovans _,_ two extinct species of humans that
cohabitated with ours not so long ago, I wasn’t that surprised. It kind of felt
natural, for reasons owing to my intuition of what I might call the “geometry of
the tree of life” and “geometry of fossil discoveries.”

This doesn’t make me a magician. My intuition is human and fallible. I’ve

only pushed to its extremes an ability naturally present in all of us.

What mathematics taught me was that it was really possible to get ahead and

move forward in life without giving up the childlike desire to remain down to
earth, to accept only what is concrete and evident.

That came as a surprise. I invented on my own these exercises of

visualization and imagination, without expecting that they would have so much
impact on my life.

In mathematics, as in many other fields, creativity is simply the ultimate

form of understanding, which itself is but a natural product of our mental
activity. It emerges when we force ourselves to continue looking at things that


-----

intimidate us until they finally become familiar and obvious.

There are many ways of grasping mathematics. We all start off with our

strengths and weaknesses. Geometry has been one of my strong points since
childhood and I have a long history of visual imagination.

I also have my weaknesses. For example, I never really was interested in

numbers, and never spent enough time thinking about them. That being said,
through repetition and habit, I did manage to develop a degree of familiarity with
them. I understand them up to a certain level. But I’ve never felt myself capable
of being creative in number theory or in arithmetic. Like a tennis player whose
backhand is relatively weak and who shifts to play his forehand, I’ve fallen into
the habit of avoiding numbers whenever possible, and looking for geometric
interpretations of quantitative statements.

If my primary interest had been with numbers, I would certainly have

developed a much stronger personal bond with them. This intuition might have
been primarily visual, or of an entirely different nature. In the end it doesn’t
matter that much. All mathematicians approach mathematical objects intuitively,
but intuitions come in many shapes and forms.

My weakest point is my inability to find my way in complicated notations, to

follow without stumbling reasonings that contain a lot of symbols and formulas.
Entire areas of mathematics put me off because of this, especially analysis. It’s
only gotten worse over time as I’ve lost patience with it.

In certain subjects that at first I wasn’t very good at, I’ve managed to get

better later on. To understand the abstract structures of algebra that caused me so
many difficulties when I was twenty, I’ve developed a particular form of sensory
intuition.

These are powerful sensations but impossible to put into words. I grasp

certain mathematical concepts through nonvisual motor sensations, tensions and
force fields within my own body, as if I could transport myself and experience
these objects _from the inside._

I feel this math in my neck and in my spine.
I know these aren’t the right words, but I can’t think of better ones. Here is

an exercise of the imagination that helped me a lot when I was trying to improve
in these subject areas. I looked at an object, for example, a bottle of shampoo
sitting in the bathroom, and asked myself the following question: if my body
were shaped like the bottle, how would it feel physically?

By practicing the same exercise with mathematical objects, I was able to

understand them. When I was thirty-five years old, this technique led me to
experience the most intense creative period of my career.


-----

It all started with a casual observation. One day, I noticed that a question I

was asking myself about the geometry of certain braids in dimension 8 could
easily be translated into the language of category theory. The unexpected link
between two very different intuitions offered a novel way of looking at problems
I’d been struggling with for years.

It was as if I’d built a bridge between two regions of my brain that up until

then hadn’t communicated with one another. There was a big jolt of
comprehension, then a series of smaller aftershocks. But it was just the
beginning. My mathematical imagination was about to undergo a massive
reconfiguration.

Each day I woke up with new ideas. Some of them were tied to the problem I

wanted to solve (a conjecture dating from the 1970s) but others took me in
completely different directions. I thought they were beautiful, but I had to quit
following them up because it was impossible to explore so many leads at the
same time. It was just too much. I tried to take notes but my understanding
progressed faster than my ability to write it down.

This state of hyperlucidity lasted six weeks, the time that I finished proving

the conjecture.

I wasn’t able to sleep. I was exhausted. Once I woke up at 4 in the morning

with the urge to look at a book I’d bought ten years earlier (the second volume of
_Representations and Cohomology_ by Dave Benson), which, at the time, I had
barely opened. I found the book on a shelf, grabbed it, sat on the floor, and read
a hundred pages in one go, as if it were a comic book. I’d never been able to read
a math book like that before. If I was able to read it so fast, it was because I
already knew what was written down: it was as if I had just seen it in my dream.

Throughout these six weeks, I had the feeling of understanding more new

mathematics than everything I’d understood in the previous twelve years, since I
had begun as a PhD student. It was going so fast that I was seasick. It was
physically overwhelming and I could no longer cope. I was hurting. I wished
that it would stop, so that I could get some rest. But it wouldn’t stop. It was like
mathematics had taken control of my brain and was thinking from inside my
head, against my will.

For the first time in my life, I realized that extreme math was a dangerous

sport.

## 17
 Controlling the Universe

If you were to think of an archetypal young math prodigy, I have a pretty

good idea of what would come to mind.

It undoubtedly won’t be the class clown who spends his time partying with

friends. Nor a well-adjusted character, good at relationships, resourceful, and
easy to live with. Nor the one who just takes it easy.

Perhaps, instead, you’d imagine someone like Ted Kaczynski.
Ted Kaczynski was born in Chicago in 1942. His exceptional math skills

were soon spotted by the school system. After scoring 167 on an IQ test, he
skipped a grade. A few years later he skipped another. He was accepted into
Harvard in 1958, when he was sixteen years old. He completed his PhD in
mathematics in 1967 and became the youngest assistant professor at Berkeley.

Apart from his academic success, Ted led a sad and lonely life. Those who

knew him in his youth described him as emotionally impaired, incapable of
communicating or building genuine relationships.

At Harvard, students he shared university housing with recalled two details:

his habit of playing the trombone in the middle of the night, and the smell of
rotting food that came from under his door.

When Ted was fifteen, he had such difficulties socializing with the other

teens that he preferred playing with the friends of his younger brother David,
who was eight.

David Kaczynski remembers his admiration for the intelligence of his older

brother, whom he loved, but also his surprise at his strange behavior. What kept
Ted from making any friends?

One day when David was eight or nine he asked his mother, “Mom, what’s

wrong with Teddy?”

## The Spectrum of Oddness

From the beginning of this book I’ve said that we need to get beyond the

stereotypes of math and mathematicians. I haven’t changed my mind. But that
doesn’t mean that these stereotypes don’t exist, or that they come out of
nowhere.

It’s no secret. When you get to know the mathematical community, one thing

that immediately strikes you is the number of “odd” characters. “Odd” is a nice
way of putting it. There are degrees of oddness. Some mathematicians are a bit
odd. Others are quite frankly odd. Still others are spectacularly odd. In some
cases, it seems to go beyond oddness. Only one word seems suitable: insanity.

It is in fact a recurring conversation topic among mathematicians. Everyone

has dozens of stories to tell. These stories can be extremely funny, but they’re so
caricatured that they’re hard to believe.

Among all the stories whose authenticity I can vouch for, let me share just

one: I once had dinner next to a mathematician who wandered about with a
garbage bag filled with train schedules that he knew by heart. The best way to
start a conversation with him was to ask the options for traveling from New
Haven to Philadelphia on a Sunday afternoon.

Getting beyond the stereotypes means keeping in mind that the majority of

mathematicians aren’t like that. It’s entirely possible to do mathematics at the
highest levels and still be “normal.” You can be well rounded socially, warm,
and open to others. You can even be a charismatic leader. Even more than
oddness, humor is a fairly typical trait among mathematicians.

That doesn’t mean that oddness doesn’t occur, often spectacularly, notably

among some of the most prominent mathematicians in history. In chapter 7 we
spoke about the life choices of Alexander Grothendieck, his extreme solitude
and asceticism.

Another striking example is Grisha Perelman, whom we’ve already come

across in chapter 10 . Born in Leningrad in 1966, he is famous for having proven
in 2003 the conjecture formulated by Poincaré in 1904. It was a massive
achievement whose scope is hard to conceive.

Perelman not only refused the Fields Medal, he also turned down the

million-dollar prize awarded to him in 2010 by the Clay Mathematical Institute
(the Poincaré conjecture figured on its list of the Millennium Prize Problems, the
seven problems deemed to be the hardest and most pivotal for the future of
mathematics).

In 2005 Perelman resigned from his position at the Steklov Institute. He


-----

doesn’t give interviews and it’s difficult to know what is going on inside his
head. His personality is so intriguing that there are stolen photos circulating on
the internet, along with fake interviews and crazy rumors.

He most likely never really spoke the phrase often attributed to him: “What

would I do with a million dollars when I can already control the universe?”

Another statement, on the other hand, comes from a reputable source:

“Money and fame don’t interest me. I don’t want to be put on display like an
animal in the zoo. I’m not some mathematical hero. I’m not even as brilliant as
all that, which is why I don’t want everyone looking at me.”

We can’t but admire Perelman’s creative intelligence, his mental prowess,

his unfailing determination, and his incorruptible nobility of mind.

And at the same time there’s something deeply troubling about his story. It

comes across as a feeling of malaise. Is that really what genius is supposed to
be? Does it always have to end this way? Is it really impossible to reach out to
others and find a means of communicating with them?

We can’t help feeling that something isn’t right. We think that if Perelman

refuses to cut his fingernails and, at nearly sixty years old, he continues to live
with his mother in a small apartment in Saint Petersburg, it’s because
something’s wrong with him.

It’s possible. But what do we know? Perelman is one of the most brilliant

minds on the planet. He’s never done anyone any harm and has the right to live
as he pleases. We’re in no position to judge him.

Is it mathematics itself that makes people “odd”? I don’t think so. I’d say

rather that math is welcoming to people who are already a bit “odd.”

It’s one of those rare careers where it’s possible to accomplish great things

even if you can’t fit in. For people already a bit “odd,” “different,” not at ease in
society, it can be a path toward socialization and fulfillment. (I tend to put
myself in this category.)

To most people, math isn’t really that dangerous.
There is, however, one major contraindication, a specific context where math

can have catastrophic side effects. If you judge by the examples that occur
throughout history with troubling frequency, mathematics seems, in certain
cases, to feed and amplify a particular mental pathology: paranoia.

## Heart of Darkness

On the spectrum of oddness, Ted Kaczynski ranked near the top.
Creativity doesn’t come in proportion to oddness. And precocity doesn’t


-----

always foreshadow a brilliant career. Ted Kaczynski was never a great
mathematician. His meager scientific output doesn’t have any particular merit.

On June 30, 1969, at twenty-seven years old, Ted Kaczynski abruptly

resigned from his position at Berkeley without giving any explanation. Two
years later, he went to live in a cabin he built himself in the forest in an isolated
part of Montana.

He chose to live alone, without running water or electricity.
Beginning in 1971, in his journal, he talks about his criminal intent: “I

emphasize that my motivation is personal revenge. I don’t pretend any kind of
philosophical or moralistic justification.”

His discourse changed over time. Later on, Kaczynski would claim that he

wanted to start a revolution. But throughout he maintained a feeling that seemed
visceral for him: a hatred of the scientific establishment and bureaucracy, which
he saw as attacking his personal freedom and freedom in general: “My ambition
is to kill a scientist, big businessman, government official or the like. I would
also like to kill a Communist.”

Over the years, during long solitary walks through the forest that he came to

identify with, Ted Kaczynski developed his plan. He would get his revenge on
industrial society for all that it had made him suffer, and for the violence it
inflicted on the trees that it heartlessly cut down to build new roads.

With method and determination he fell further and further into an

unbelievable murderous web.

He wasn’t captured until 1996, after the longest and most costly investigation

in the history of the FBI. It had lasted more than seventeen years and employed
up to 150 full-time agents.

In 1998, Ted Kaczynski began serving eight consecutive life terms without

the possibility of parole at the super-maximum facility in Florence, Colorado,
the most secure prison in the United States. His co-detainees included the likes
of Zacarias Moussaoui, one of the 9/11 terrorists, and El Chapo, the Mexican
drug baron.

He died in 2023 in an apparent suicide.

His story is bleak but it needs to be told. It can teach us something

fundamental about rationality: its power, limitations, dangers, and the good and
bad ways to use it.

## Unabomber

On November 15, 1979, American Airlines flight 444 left Chicago for

Washington, DC. Midway through the flight the passengers heard a muffled
sound. The cabin filled with acrid smoke and the oxygen masks fell. The smoke
was so dense that it got inside the masks.

The pilot was able to make an emergency landing. Twelve people were

hospitalized with smoke inhalation. On the ground, the initial findings left no
doubt: there had been a bomb in the plane which, if it had worked correctly,
would have obliterated it midair.

A link was quickly established with two booby-trapped packages left on the

campus of Northwestern University, near Chicago.

This was the first in a very long series of similar incidents.
On June 10, 1980, Percy Wood, president of United Airlines, was seriously

injured by a package bomb sent to his home in Lake Forest, a suburb of Chicago.
In 1981, a bomb was defused on the campus of the University of Utah.

The attacks continued until 1995. Sixteen bombs resulted in three people

dead and twenty-three wounded. The targets were universities (a building in
Berkeley was targeted twice) and businesses having to do with aviation,
industry, or technology (among them the Boeing offices, electronics stores, and a
lobbyist for the timber industry).


-----

In this indecipherable case of serial terrorism, the investigators followed up

on the slightest of clues.

Although some devices carried the initials FC, which was later revealed to

stand for “Freedom Club,” the FBI remained convinced there was only a single
person behind the attacks. Agents constructed a psychological profile of a man
fed by a fierce hatred against universities and aerial transport. He was also
obsessed with wood and forests. This fascination manifested itself in the choice
of targets (the timber industry, Percy _Wood,_ Lake _Forest_ ) as well as in the
materials used to make the bombs. Some contained pieces of bark; others were
camouflaged to resemble logs.

The FBI and the media dubbed him the “Unabomber,” short for “University

and Airline Bomber.”

As for the bombs themselves, they posed a lot of difficulties for

investigators. Ordinarily, it’s possible to make each fragment left at the scene
“speak”: by analyzing something as small as a nail, they might be able to
identify the manufacturer and places where it might have been sold.

The problem was that the nails used by the Unabomber were all made by

hand. There were no clues to follow, no fingerprints. The components of the
bombs had all been carefully sandpapered.

The terrorist was someone patient and meticulous who was not afraid of

building everything from scratch.

The investigators had to wait until 1995 for an opening in the case. That year

the Unabomber sent a typed manuscript to the _New York Times,_ the _Washington_
_Post,_ and _Penthouse_ along with a letter in which he said he would give up his
attacks if the text was published. Following the recommendation of the FBI, the
_New York Times_ and the _Washington Post_ published it on September 19, 1995.

The Unabomber manifesto, “Industrial Society and Its Future,” is

meticulously constructed and argued. Constituting paragraphs numbered from 1
to 232, it’s a radical critique of modern society and the hold that technology has
on our lives. According to the Unabomber, there’s nothing worth saving, so the
entire system needs to be torn down.

The statements are at times relevant and at other times absurd. Certain

passages betray preoccupations that you wouldn’t expect from your typical
terrorist: “It is true that one can ask serious questions about the foundations of
scientific knowledge and about how, if at all, the concept of objective reality can
be defined. But it is obvious that modern leftish philosophers are not simply
cool-headed logicians systematically analyzing the foundations of knowledge.”

When David Kaczynski read this passage, he was struck by the phrase “cool-


-----

headed logicians.” He remembered a letter in which his brother Ted used exactly
the same words to say exactly the same thing.

Suspecting that his brother was the most wanted criminal in the United

States, David Kaczynski was confronted with a terrible moral dilemma. Should
he turn in his brother and risk seeing him sentenced to death, or stay quiet and
risk becoming an accomplice to the possible murder of new victims?

After lengthy reflection, he chose to speak to the FBI. This led to the arrest

of Ted Kaczynski on April 3, 1996.

## “A crude approximation to the truth”

At the start of 1996, when the investigators were confronted with this

unexpected lead, they sought to evaluate its credibility. Something troubled
them. Ted Kaczynski’s biography didn’t correspond to the image they had of the
Unabomber. Certain elements matched, notably the survivalist lifestyle, but his
degree of scholarly achievement and his past as a mathematician were a surprise.

To address the uncertainty, the FBI decided to secretly consult Bill Thurston,

who was at the time director of the Mathematical Science Research Institute at
Berkeley.

After he read the manifesto, Thurston had no doubts. It was immediately

clear to him that it had been written by a mathematician.

I don’t know which elements Thurston relied on to reach this conclusion.

Redoing the exercise myself (although it’s much easier once you know the end
of the story), I was above all struck by the last paragraphs. After having
proclaimed certitudes for dozens of pages, Kaczynski suddenly points to the
fragility of the delirious edifice he had spent twenty-five years constructing:

FINAL NOTE
231. Throughout this article we’ve made imprecise statements . . . and some of our statements may
be flatly false. . . . And of course in a discussion of this kind one must rely heavily on intuitive
judgment, and that can sometimes be wrong. So we don’t claim that this article expresses more than
a crude approximation to the truth.

The concept of truth is at the center of Kaczynski’s preoccupations. He

blames modern philosophers for having led an “attack against truth and reality.”

But what is truth? How could Kaczynski say that his manifesto was only a

crude approximation, and yet find it reasonable to kill in the name of this truth?
Did he want to suggest that he personally had access to the truth, even though he
didn’t entirely set it down in his manifesto?


-----

Despite all the while recognizing the weakness of his argument, Kaczynski

seemed convinced he was right and the rest of the world was wrong. He was
never able to entirely prove it, but that didn’t worry him: for him, everything was
clear. He had _fabricated_ his own truths and certainties, and organized them into
a coherent system in which other people and other opinions had no place.

When he learned in the press that, for the first time, one of his bombs had

killed someone and that the victim had been torn to pieces, he wrote a
celebratory entry in his journal: “Excellent. Humane way to eliminate somebody.
He probably never felt a thing.”

There’s a troubling impression that arises from all this. What if Kaczynski

had used techniques of mathematicians to arrive at this frightening level of selfradicalization?

It shouldn’t come as a surprise that techniques that seek to reprogram your

intuition could turn out to be dangerous. After all, misusing a kitchen knife or
even a potato peeler can already send you to the emergency room.

According to the psychiatrist who examined him before his trial, Ted

Kaczynski suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. According to Kaczynski, this
diagnosis was political persecution. He believed himself to be of sound mind.
His lawyers wanted to enter an insanity defense but Kaczynski refused, instead
choosing to plead guilty.

Paranoid delirium is a close relation to mathematical reasoning. In a way it’s

the evil twin. Some people even have difficulty telling them apart. There is,
however, an easy way to distinguish them, which we’ll get back to.

## “What’s a mathematician to do?”

In 2010, two years before his death, Bill Thurston still seemed preoccupied

with the tragic fate of Ted Kaczynski.

He took the time to write a long response to a question asked on

MathOverflow, a collaborative site for the math community. The question came
from a user named Muad, apparently a young student lacking in self-assurance.
It’s entitled “What’s a mathematician to do?”

Muad asks how he can contribute to mathematics. He has the feeling that

“mathematics is made by people like Gauss or Euler,” whose work you can try
to understand without this understanding leading to anything new. His fear is
that there’s nothing new to discover for people like him, normal people, those
who don’t have any “special talent.”

Most math students experience similar feelings at one point or another.


-----

Thurston’s response offers a radical change of perspective:

The product of mathematics is clarity and understanding. Not theorems, by themselves.

The world does not suffer from an oversupply of clarity and understanding (to put it mildly).

The real satisfaction from mathematics is in learning from others and sharing with others. All of us
have clear understanding of a few things and murky concepts of many more. There is no way to run
out of ideas in need of clarification.

Thurston defines mathematics as a collaborative human project oriented

toward sharing and understanding, not a search for eternal truths. Without
human understanding, theorems have no value. Who cares who proved this or
that result first? What counts is the meaning that we give to those results. Real
math is the one that lives in each of us.

Thurston’s response might seem innocuous, but it’s a profound questioning

of the way that math has been presented for over two millennia. It’s one of the
key messages of this book and we’ll come back to it.

He continues:

We are deeply social and deeply instinctual animals, so much that our well-being depends on many
things we do that are hard to explain in an intellectual way.

Bare reason is likely to lead you astray. None of us are smart and wise enough to figure it out
intellectually.

It’s at this precise point, with the word _astray,_ that Thurston includes a direct

reference to Ted Kaczynski by inserting a link to his Wikipedia page.

Saying that “bare reason is likely to lead you astray” seems banal,

commonsense advice but too vague and unoriginal to attach much importance to
it. That’s not the case: Thurston is dead serious. He knows exactly what he’s
talking about and he’s making a precise statement.

In chapter 14 we talked about Descartes’s project to reconstruct all of science

and philosophy from the ground up, relying on our innate ability to find evident
that which is true. We said that this approach, _rationalism_ , encountered
difficulties that Descartes hadn’t foreseen.

When Thurston says that “none of us are smart and wise enough” and that

“bare reason is likely to lead you astray,” this is what he’s talking about.

Why is mathematical thought so powerful? What, however, are its limits, and

what are the limits of rationality? How do we distinguish between mathematical


-----

reasoning and paranoid delirium? The answer to these questions isn’t found in
mathematics itself but in its close relationship with our language and the inner
workings of our intelligence.

This is the subject that will occupy us to the end of the book.

## 18
 The Elephant in the Room

You’ve always known there’s a problem with rationality.
It’s supposed to be the basis of our civilization. At any rate that’s what they

tell you in school. We’re taught to organize our ideas in a logical and structured
manner. We’re taught to distinguish between a reasoning that’s valid and one
that’s not. We’re taught to discount what isn’t logical, rigorous, coherent.

Of course, no one’s stupid enough to believe this story. We just pretend we

do. Once the lesson is over, once the school door’s closed, we continue to live
our lives as if all that was of no importance.

Believing that one day we can become entirely rational is as naïve as

believing that one day we’ll stop eating sweet and fatty foods.

The paradox is that it doesn’t stop us from having recourse to secret

rationality.

When you’re sincerely preoccupied with something, when you’re in trouble,

when you have problems at work or problems at home, you instinctively call on
the method used by mathematicians.

At night, in your bed, you try to understand the issue. You mull it over. You

replay in your head mental images that you dig up from the depths of your
memory and imagination. You play Lego with these images. You try to organize
them, fit them together and assemble something meaningful, something that
makes sense.

Sometimes you have the feeling you understand it all. Your mental images

come together. You reinterpret a past event in a new way. You pick up on a
detail, a new element, something that had been right under your nose that you
hadn’t yet perceived.

Now that you see it, everything makes sense. It’s a revelation, a discovery

that gets you excited and makes you want to share it with others.

You talk about it with your best friend. But soon enough you notice


-----

something in her eyes that troubles you. She seems annoyed. She’s worried
about you. All that she can find to say is a simple phrase: “Try not to rationalize
too much.”

The worst thing is, you know she’s right. You yourself, when someone

comes up with a reasoning where everything all fits together too neatly, suspect
that something isn’t right. He’d thought about it too much, and it seems fishy.

For example, a guy who’s spent twenty years in a log cabin, thinking through

the root cause of every problem with our civilization, and comes up with a
manifesto of 232 numbered paragraphs where everything fits together all too
well—you don’t find that entirely reassuring. You don’t tell yourself, “The guy
must be right.” Instead you say, “The guy can’t have many friends.”

If your distrust of rationality was only a matter of intellectual laziness, of not

trying hard enough, that would be no big deal. You could let others do the work
and benefit from their wisdom.

The problem is that you don’t have confidence in the outputs of rationality.

You know that thinking and reasoning don’t always uncover the truth.
Sometimes you have the opposite impression: in some cases, rationality leads
you astray from the truth.

It’s no small problem. It’s an enormous problem. It’s the elephant in the

room—a problem so enormous and laden with consequence, so central to our
existence, that it’s never spoken of.

If humanity wants to give itself the slightest chance to overcome the

formidable challenges that it is facing, wouldn’t it be better if we could start by
agreeing whether or not Descartes’s method actually works?

## Sand and Mud

When Descartes formulated the project to reconstruct science and philosophy

from the ground up, it’s easy to see where he was coming from.

He remarked that the greatest scholars were incapable of agreeing on the

most elementary subjects. Quite often their so-called knowledge consisted only
of “magnificent palaces built on nothing more than sand and mud.”
Mathematics, on the contrary, was built on solid rock. This is what caught
Descartes’s eye: “I was astonished that nothing more exalted had been built on
such sure and solid foundations.”

Since the methods used by mathematicians are so effective, since they

produce truths that survive millennia without showing their age, couldn’t we
apply them outside of mathematics and produce unshakeable truths?


-----

We now know the answer, and it is, unfortunately, no, we cannot. Or rather,

the answer is partially positive and partially negative.

You can apply the methods used by mathematicians outside of math. I

wouldn’t have written this book if I didn’t want to encourage you to do so.
Descartes was right, his method is an incredible tool for understanding the
world, and it can literally make us more intelligent. At any rate, there is no plan
B. We have no alternate method at our disposal that offers similar benefits.

But when we use it outside of mathematics, we need to be careful: it’s only

within mathematics that this method is able to produce unshakeable truths.

That doesn’t mean you should stop thinking. Being careful doesn’t mean

opting for confusion and indecisiveness, and refusing to “proceed with
confidence through life.” Quite the contrary. Rationalizing, looking for
explanations for things you don’t understand, is a great thing to do. Why would
anyone choose to remain ignorant?

Being careful simply means keeping in mind that Descartes’s method has the

effect of modifying your mental representations and your intuitions and
gradually reinforcing their internal consistency.

It’s in fact the whole point of the approach. By anchoring our convictions in

indisputable evidence and rigorous deduction, we can turn them into certitudes
that, over time, become as strong as reinforced concrete.

Except that sometimes these certitudes are false.

## A Sort of Unbreachable Wall

You’re absolutely certain that all chickens come from eggs, which are laid

by other chickens. Through perfectly rigorous reasoning, from a logical
perspective, you should thus deduce with absolute certainty that there was never
a first chicken nor a first egg, that chickens and eggs have existed since the dawn
of time. Chickens and eggs thus preexisted the formation of the planet.

This example is idiotic and that’s why it’s so important. If such a simple

reasoning leads to a conclusion so profoundly flawed, what confidence can we
have in reasonings that aren’t even idiotic but, instead, are contrived and seem
intelligent?

The riddle of the chicken and the egg is supposed to present us with a

“paradox,” a sort of unbreachable wall to human comprehension, before which
we have no other choice but to bow down.

But there aren’t any more paradoxes than there are tricks, or truths that are

counterintuitive by nature. Being a paradox is always a temporary status, in wait


-----

of a resolution. Presenting a problem as structurally being a paradox is just a
pompous way of saying you can’t solve it.

A superficial resolution of the riddle of the chicken and the egg calls in the

theory of evolution. The mother of the chicken we see is another chicken,
slightly different from the first. The mother of this second chicken is a bit more
different. Everything’s fine up to this point. We’re still talking about chickens
and eggs that look like chickens and eggs.

But if you go back 150 million years, you come across the mother of the

mother . . . of the mother of the chicken, who doesn’t look like a chicken at all,
but a dinosaur. Go back even further, and we come across animals that don’t
even lay eggs. That might not tell us what they look like but at least it reassures
us that chickens didn’t preexist the formation of the planet.

This way of solving the riddle, however, leaves aside its most troubling

aspect: why was there a riddle in the first place? How can it be that, starting
from a hypothesis that is indisputably true, following a reasoning that is
indisputably correct, we arrive at a conclusion that is indisputably false?

That’s the true riddle of the chicken and the egg, and its solution has been

known for almost a century. But this solution is so staggering, unsettling, and
consequential that it’s carefully obscured and left out of schools.

Here is the reason why there was a riddle: human language is structurally

incompatible with logical reasoning, and we can never have 100 percent
certainty in truths expressed in human language and arrived at through deductive
logic.

That goes for all kinds of “truths,” the ones coming from official science and

the ones coming from our small everyday reasoning that we employ all the time.
And it doesn’t matter whether we express our reasoning in words, following
structured and logically coherent arguments, or whether we secretly manipulate
mental images in our head. It doesn’t matter whether we’re aware of thinking
something through, or whether we let ourselves be guided by our intuition.

The sad reality is that contrary to what Descartes claimed, the “things that we

conceive of very clearly and distinctly” are not always true.

Descartes missed an essential point: all reasoning, even the most solid, ends

up coming apart the further it gets from day-to-day experience, not for lack of
rigor but because our language itself is built on a base of sand and mud.

The only exception is mathematical reasoning when it is articulated in the

official language of mathematics. If this artificial language is so inhuman and so
incompatible with our usual way of thinking, it’s for a very simple reason: its
bias is to be compatible with logical reasoning.


-----

When we want to venture far from our everyday concrete experience, logical

formalism helps guide us. It’s the only tool at our disposal that lets us give free
rein to our impulse toward rationality without limits, without complexes or
taboos.

Outside of mathematics, rationality remains under constant threat from the

fragility of our language and our way of perceiving the world.

## Elephants Don’t Exist

In chapter 6 , we already stated that the official language of mathematics,

logical formalism, is a foreign language for humans, and we gave this example
to show how it works: in mathematics, if having a trunk is part of the definition
of an elephant, then an elephant without a trunk immediately ceases being an
elephant.

This bizarre, perversely rigid relationship to the meaning of words is at the

heart of the mathematical approach. It’s an oddity that often shocks beginners.
But there’s a simple explanation for it: without this rigidity, no language can be
compatible with logical reasoning. It may be annoying, but that’s how it is.

Any reasoning about elephants that makes use of the fact that they have

trunks will be invalidated by the discovery of a single elephant without a trunk.

In chapter 8 , we touched upon a related topic when discussing the

shortcomings of dictionaries. At a distance, dictionaries look like the real thing.
We always want to believe that the words we use are solidly defined and that the
phrases we speak have a precise meaning. But once you scratch a bit below the
surface, you find circular definitions.

The error would be in believing that people who put together dictionaries

aren’t doing their job correctly, and that there’s a better, smarter, and more
rigorous way of defining the words we use.

But there’s a deep structural reason why dictionary definitions are so

deficient: it’s rigorously impossible to truly define words in our language, and
our relationship to the world is much less solid than we would like to believe.

Starting with a word from everyday language, trying to solidify the

definition, and finding out that it’s an impossible task: it’s a troubling yet
instructive experience that you should take the time to try at least once in your
life.

Let’s do that with elephants. I found this definition in a dictionary: “a

thickset, usually extremely large, nearly hairless, herbivorous mammal that has a
snout elongated into a muscular trunk and two incisors in the upper jaw


-----

developed especially in the male into long ivory tusks.”

The approach has the merit of being pragmatic. It consists of listing the

different characteristics you can expect to find in an elephant. It is nevertheless a
circular definition: how do you think they define a “trunk”? or a “tusk”? or
“ivory”?

Apart from circularity, this definition also has the flaw of being silent on an

essential aspect, the concept of animal species.

It’s obvious to all that we’re not dealing with animals that are isolated

individuals, but with beings that we can group into species. If we’ve invented
this word _elephant,_ it’s because we had the impression that the individual
elephants in front of our eyes all shared something in common. By “elephant,”
it’s this common thing between them that we’re referring to, the _species_ .

In reality, as you know, elephants make up not one but two species, African

elephants and Asian elephants.

In fact, it’s more complicated than that. For more than twenty years

biologists have known that there are two distinct species of African elephants:
the savanna elephant, whose scientific name is _Loxodonta africana,_ and the
forest elephant, _Loxodonta cyclotis._ Asian elephants form a third species,
_Elephas maximus._

If you really wanted to give a noncircular and seriously scientific definition

of the word _elephant,_ you might come up with something like “Generic name
given to representatives of three species, _Loxodonta africana, Loxodonta_
_cyclotis,_ and _Elephas maximus._ ”

Except that now you’d have to give a serious definition of _Loxodonta_

_africana, Loxodonta cyclotis,_ and _Elephas maximus._ And as shocking as it may
seem, no one is able to do so.

In practice, biologists define species as starting from a given individual,

called a _holotype,_ that serves as a point of reference. For example, there’s a
specific elephant (who’s been dead for a long time) that has the honor of serving
as the holotype for _Loxodonta africana._ It is “elephant zero,” the standard-bearer
of the species. From a scientific point of view, _Loxodonta africana_ is nothing
other than the group of individuals, living or dead, “of the same species as” this
elephant zero.

It simply remains to give a precise meaning to “of the same species as.” And

here’s where things get tricky.

In any reasonable definition of an animal species, you’d want to be able to

say that a mother is of the same species as its children. But if you take on one
hand the mother of the mother . . . of the mother of elephant zero, and on the


-----

other hand the mother of the mother . . . of your own mother, at a certain point
you’ll get to the same female, belonging to a species of extinct mammals that
lived more than 150 million years ago, alongside dinosaurs. It’s the exact same
problem of the chicken and the egg. The logical conclusion is that you are an
elephant.

To avoid this problem, it’s necessary to set a limit: you’re of the same

species as your mother, and the mother of your mother, and so on, but you can’t
continue that indefinitely.

How do you determine the limit? The official solution relies on the concept

of _interfertility_ and leads to the following definition, which you can find on
Wikipedia under “species”: “In biology, a species is often defined as the largest
group of organisms in which any two individuals of the appropriate sexes or
mating types can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction.”

The issue of fertile offspring notably concerns donkeys and horses, which

can produce offspring (mules) that are, however, sterile. They are thus two
different species.

You might think that we’ve finally nailed it. But that’s far from being the

case. According to this definition, a sterile individual is a species unto itself.
When you neuter your cat, it changes species. That obviously makes no sense,
but it’s the result of the strict application of the definition.

More seriously, what do you do when the offspring are generally but not

always sterile? There are a number of documented examples of fertile mules.
Where do you set the limit? Is it necessary to fix a threshold, arbitrarily decree
that less than 1 percent of a chance of producing fertile offspring means you’re
dealing with two distinct species?

The notion of interfertility is intrinsically vague and problematic. When two

species separate, at the precise moment when the definition would be of most
value, it ceases to function. This concerns the origins of our own species: our
DNA carries traces of fertile hybridizations with Neanderthals. Does this mean
that _Homo sapiens_ and _Homo neanderthalensis_ form one and the same species,
contrary to what is communally admitted?

Apart from these theoretic inconsistencies, the biological species concept

creates immense practical issues. If I want to know whether I’m a savanna
elephant, I should mate with a female _Loxodonta africana._ What do I do if she’s
not in the mood? Or if she doesn’t get pregnant because it’s not the right
moment? How many times do I need to try?

Biologists are supposed to have a more developed practical sense than

mathematicians. I’d be curious to know how they do it.


-----

## Vaguely Knowing What We Mean

The strangest thing about all this is the contrast between our inability to give

a 100 percent rigorous definition of an elephant, and the evidence with which the
concept presents itself to our intuition.

When we hear the word _elephant,_ we have the impression that we know very

well what it means. When we encounter an elephant, we recognize it right away.
We have a perfectly clear notion of what elephants are.

The problems come along only once we try to specify the slight vagueness

that surrounds the first definition we come up with, when we want to make it
compatible with logical reasoning. Our attempts to specify our thinking always
end in incoherence, creating inconsistencies that we have to resolve each time
with new scientific discoveries, which in turn lead to new inconsistencies.

Something simple, concrete, and plainly _obvious_ seems impossible to really

capture in words.

This oddity isn’t specific to the notion of an elephant. It’s a universal

phenomenon that reflects the neurological underpinnings of our mental
processes. We’ll come back to this in the next chapter.

The most spectacular illustration of our inability to give a precise meaning to

words comes from the pen of Charles Darwin himself, in 1859, in the opening
lines of the second chapter of _Origin of Species:_ “Nor shall I here discuss the
various definitions which have been given of the term species. No one definition
has as yet satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he
means when he speaks of a species.”

It is quite telling to find such a blatant admission of weakness at the heart of

a timeless scientific masterpiece. The issue runs deep and there’s not much we
can do about it.

Darwin knew only vaguely what he meant by species, and yet he wrote an

entire book about it.

## Two Languages, Two Sets of Rules

In the end, if you really want to understand what math is and why it is

omnipresent in science, you have to start with this fragility of our language.

Mathematics is as old as our desire for reason, and, to this end, to secure and

stabilize the meaning of words. It’s a common error to restrict it to the study of
numbers and shapes. Beyond its technical aspects, beyond theorems and
equations, math is above all a different way of using language and attributing
meaning to words.


-----

Human language and mathematical language have evolved in parallel over

millennia. Today they have become so intertwined that it’s become hard to tell
one from the other. In day-to-day life, in the most ordinary kinds of
conversations, we navigate between these two ways of using words, generally
without being aware of it.

That goes for all of us, even people who think they hate math. Whatever our

background and academic level, we have all acquired a certain degree of
familiarity with the mathematical approach and have daily recourse to the modes
of thinking it enables.

And since no one’s ever explained to us how the whole thing works, we keep

getting tripped up. We pass from one language to the next, forgetting that they
follow two totally different logics. In some cases, this leads to serious
consequences.

Each of these languages has its own functions, its own set of rules, its own

strengths, its own weaknesses. And they’re equally indispensable.

## Taking Words at Face Value


The two languages often use the same words. What changes is how we

attribute meaning to those words.

The word _sphere_ is a good example. When you hear someone say, “The

Earth is shaped like a sphere,” the meaning of these words is pretty clear to you.


-----

If, like me, you think the statement is correct, it is because you interpret the

word _sphere_ in human language, in a perceptual and vague manner.

In mathematical language, however, the statement is clearly false: spheres

can’t have mountains.

In mathematics, words are defined “axiomatically”: via formal definitions

that characterize them entirely. They are imaginary, perfect, and fixed
constructions: a sphere is “the set of all points in three-dimensional space that
are located at an equal distance from a center.” You can’t change any of this. If
you take out or even slightly shift a single point, it ceases to be a sphere.

The worst thing is that “sphere” has the exact same definition in human-

language dictionaries. The only thing that changes is our relationship to the
definition.

In human language, no one ever really takes words at face value. In real life,

what you call a sphere corresponds to what you perceive of as a sphere. To
decree that a given shape is a sphere, you have a tolerance margin. An orange is
a sphere, an apple is more or less a sphere, a pear isn’t a sphere. I challenge you
to write down the exact contours of the tolerance margin that is implicit in your
perceptual definition of a sphere.

## Rationalism vs. Empiricism

More interestingly, you can do it the other way. You can start with a word in

human language and pretend to treat it as a word in mathematical language. It’s
what we all do whenever we reason.

It’s a bit tricky, but we’re experts at doing it without ever noticing. We start

with human language, shift to mathematical language for reasoning, and return
to human language. We do this each time we formulate hypotheses and try to
draw conclusions from them.

This day-to-day activity is an instance of what is pompously called _the_

_scientific approach._ I’ll sum it up as follows through an example that is rather
simplistic but faithfully illustrates all the steps in the process.

If you state, for example, that by definition an elephant is “a representative

of one of three species, _Loxodonta africana, Loxodonta cyclotis,_ and _Elephas_
_maximus,_ ” if you make believe that this definition states an absolute truth, then it
is possible to draw logical conclusions from it.

That’s what dictionary definitions are for: they serve as _mathematical models_

that temporarily anchor the meaning of words, giving us a chance to reason with
them.


-----

When you have an elephant in front of you that is neither _Loxodonta_

_africana_ nor _Elephas maximus,_ you can deduce that it’s _Loxodonta cyclotis._
Within your model, this deduction is 100 percent reliable. You’re absolutely
sure: you “did the math.”

But is this deduction correct in real life? It all depends on the reliability of

your model. Perhaps you’re out of luck (or incredibly lucky) and you have a
fourth species of elephant before you, so rare that it hasn’t yet been described.

In human language, nothing is ever 100 percent reliable. We’re constantly

being surprised. It’s why a scientific theory only ever makes predictions, which
can then be validated by experience (and the theory gains credibility) or
disproven (in which case you need to change the model).

Models are not good or bad in and of themselves. Saying that the Earth is

shaped like a sphere is a good enough model as long as you don’t try to deduce
from it that mountains don’t exist. The success of our technology is proof that
the scientific approach works: even if it doesn’t produce _absolute_ truths, science
gives us a powerful method of thinking and its predictions are close enough to
reality to be of practical use.

In the end, rationality should be used as a guide rather than an ultimate

judge. The reality that’s before our eyes always merits more attention than the
certitudes in our heads. Rationality is great, but empiricists do have a point.

Trusting reason too much, using human language as if it had all the attributes

of mathematical language, as if words had a precise meaning, as if each detail
merited being interpreted and the logical validity of an argument sufficed to
guarantee the validity of its conclusions, is a characteristic symptom of paranoia.
When applied outside of mathematics and without any safeguards, mathematical
reasoning becomes an actual illness.

## A Torn Spider’s Web

Our ancestral addiction to overthinking is without a doubt the source of

terrible misunderstandings that surround the notion of truth.

When I speak of “truth,” I’m speaking of the truth of mathematicians, the

absolute and eternal truth, what some people like to write as Truth, or TRUTH,
or sometimes even **TRUTH.**

This sort of truth is a mathematical concept. It exists in the same way as the

number 5 or triangles and rectangles. It is undoubtedly the first invention in the
history of mathematics, that which preceded all the others and which has had the
greatest impact on our culture.


-----

Mathematical “truth” has its counterpart in human language, just like

“sphere.” But the human version is very problematic. Like a fruit that doesn’t
tolerate shipping well, the concept of truth suffers in translation. A damaged
sphere still looks like a sphere, but a damaged truth doesn’t look like anything at
all.

Besides, we never expect statements in human language to be definitively

and implacably “true.” We simply expect them to be clear, expressive,
interesting, honest, sincere, and able to teach us something useful and relevant
about the world.

When we say that something is “true,” we never mean it literally. We only

ever use the word as a shortcut for all these other things, because otherwise we’d
have no occasion to use it.

This situation is of course frustrating. We’d like the world to be clearer and

more stable. We’d like truth to be more solid and less dependent on our point of
view.

The Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) perfectly

summed up this frustration: “The more closely we examine actual language, the
greater becomes the conflict between it and our requirement.”

Logic doesn’t function unless words have a definition that is explicit,

perfectly precise, and stable over time. Despite immense efforts, we’ve been
unable to produce these kinds of definitions outside of mathematics.
Wittgenstein affirms that it’s a quixotic quest: **“We feel as if we had to repair a**
**torn spider’s web with our fingers.”**

In acknowledging the intrinsic limitations of our language, Wittgenstein

made one of the great philosophical breakthroughs of the twentieth century. This
allowed him to break with a multi-millennial tradition dominated by
metaphysics, in which philosophers believed that it was possible to attack, using
rationality, problems that were strikingly similar to that of the chicken and the
egg: problems so remote from our daily experience that they were occurring only
as a result of our language losing its grip.

It’s surprising that Wittgenstein’s philosophy isn’t more well known outside

of specialized circles, as it holds a very practical life lesson: we should accept
going step by step, clarifying our language as we move forward, and being
regularly surprised. It’s an effective antidote for paranoia.

Another key lesson we should have drawn from him concerns the way we

teach mathematics. The lesson is very much in line with Thurston’s remark that
“The product of mathematics is clarity and understanding. Not theorems, by
themselves.”


-----

If math were good only for producing eternal truths, it would be of strictly no

use, since there is no place for eternal truths in the human experience (as our
language simply doesn’t permit it).

Yet we continue to teach math. This indicates that we continue to believe

that math is useful in a certain way. So what is it that math is good for?

To find out, to understand how math really works and what it can really do

for us, we cannot continue to overlook its most direct practical aspect: math
works on our brain and modifies how we see the world.

 Abstract and Vague

Are you familiar with this optical illusion? It’s one of the oldest and most

famous.

What do you see?
Look closely.
Most people will say they see an elephant. I imagine you see one as well. But

can you see something else?

Take your time.
Give yourself a real chance before turning the page and reading what

follows.


-----

The most extraordinary thing about this illusion is that it takes quite a bit of

effort to make it go away. It’s nearly impossible not to see an elephant. And yet,
if you look closely, you’ll notice that there is no elephant, just ink on a page.

Between ink on page and an elephant, the difference is indisputably massive.

What mysterious phenomenon makes us see an elephant where there’s only ink
on a page?

This type of optical illusion is nowadays called a _drawing._ A drawing, of

course, is a lot more than an illusion. A drawing has style and artistic value, it
carries a message, a symbolic and cultural significance that can’t be reduced to
its figurative content.

And yet, if we instantly recognize mammoths painted on cave walls by

Paleolithic people whose language, customs, and beliefs we know nothing of,
it’s because something in the drawing goes beyond any cultural convention.
Even if we don’t have the codes, we understand it all the same. Our brain
automatically makes the connection between a _drawn_ animal and a _real_ animal.
It’s in this way that drawings are true optical illusions.

Visual comprehension of drawings develops from infancy and doesn’t

require any special teaching. Babies understand drawings before being able to
talk. They understand them so well that we rely on drawings to teach
vocabulary. If drawings were only cultural conventions, it would be the other
way around: babies would begin by learning vocabulary and then be able to
learn how to recognize drawings.

A number of animal species (and not just mammals) are known to be capable

of recognizing drawn objects without having been taught. Understanding
drawings isn’t a strictly human privilege.

The illusion at work in a drawing is something really extraordinary.
Just consider the amount of information that you managed to gather from the

little sketch that opened this chapter. Is the elephant young or old? Dangerous or
harmless? Is it angry? Does it have a lot of self-confidence? Do you feel
sympathy or distrust?

You’ve never taken a class on interpreting drawings and yet you know how

to answer these questions, immediately and without any effort. All that from a
few lines drawn on a page.

_How is such a miracle even biologically possible?_
The explanation that current science is able to provide will help clarify the

nature of our learning process, and how the mental plasticity described since the


-----

beginning of this book actually operates.

## The Mystery of Vision

Vision is a complex phenomenon that concerns optics, biochemistry, and

neurology. The organs of vision comprise not only the eye but also the optic
nerve and above all the brain.

Knowing what eyes are used for is simple enough: roughly speaking, they’re

cameras. The metaphor is simple, and even a bit simplistic, but it’s relevant and
reasonably correct. There are many unresolved scientific questions about how
our eyes work, their development in the embryonic stage, and the evolutionary
processes that led to their emergence. These are legitimate and difficult
questions. But we know enough to have reached the point where it’d be
ridiculous to claim that eyes are something of a mystery.

As for the optic nerve, it can be seen as a kind of cable linking the eye to the

brain. Here again the metaphor works quite well (although the optic nerve does
also perform some signal preprocessing).

On the other hand, what happens once you get past the optic nerve and inside

our visual cortex is a very intriguing phenomenon that has long resisted our
efforts to understand it. You can legitimately say that it has long been one of the
great mysteries in the history of science.

With a camera, an image is formed of pixels: it’s a grid in which each box

has a certain value of red, green, and blue luminosity. The mystery concerns the
way our brain treats the raw information received from the optic nerve to
“extract meaning” and to “recognize” what is in the image.

Here is a good way to sum up the problem: by knowing the luminosity and

the color values of all the pixels, how is it that you know there’s an elephant
somewhere in the image?

## The Concept of “Elephantness”

The ease with which we recognize elephants is all the more troubling since,

as we’ve seen in the previous chapter, we’re unable to really define what they
are.

This is no coincidence. We’d like to define elephants as we perceive them,

because that definition would have the most sense for us. But the method that
our brain uses to recognize elephants is at the same time stunningly efficient and
perfectly impossible to translate into words.


-----

In fact, it’s so efficient that it’s hardly believable.
First off, your ability to recognize an elephant doesn’t depend on the angle

you’re looking from. Whether you see it from in front or from behind, from the
side or in three-quarters view, standing upright or lying down, whether it’s big or
small, however it’s moving in relation to your own movement, you recognize it
instantly. You also have an incredible tolerance for a multitude of abnormalities
and unexpected characteristics an elephant might exhibit. Whether the elephant
is albino or painted with geometric shapes or colored stripes, you’ll still know
it’s an elephant.

From a strictly visual point of view, however, that is, from a point of view of

the luminosity and color of the pixels in the raw image, these anomalous
situations really don’t have much in common.

But that’s not all. When a child sees a real elephant for the first time, even if

they’ve never seen a picture or heard it spoken of before, if you point your finger
at the elephant and say, “That’s an elephant,” the child knows immediately what
you’re talking about.

That’s not as obvious as it may seem. What keeps the child from thinking

that what you’re calling an _elephant_ is simply the left front foot, or the trunk, or
a piece of the trunk, or a fly sitting on the trunk?

If the child understands right away, it’s because they already see the

elephant. They noticed it immediately, well before you said what it was. The
elephant stood out as something remarkable that deserved a name. They were
probably getting ready to ask you what it was.

Without this ability, our language simply wouldn’t exist. We wouldn’t be

able to explain what words referred to.

There’s something even more surprising. If, instead of meeting elephants for

the first time in the flesh, your child began by seeing grotesquely cartoonish
drawings of them, that wouldn’t be a problem. They’d be perfectly convinced
they knew what an elephant was. The day they saw one _for real_ they might be
surprised and probably intimidated by its size, but they’d easily recognize the
animal they already knew.

The conclusion to all of this is that our brain seems to automatically extract,

from the raw visual data fed continuously into it by the optic nerve, a universal
idea of what an elephant is. It then becomes able to recognize this abstract
concept of an elephant through its multiple incarnations, in situations so
remarkably varied it would be ridiculous to try to list them all.

Without trying, as if by magic, we develop a curiously reliable sense of

“elephantness” by mere exposure to scenes involving elephants.


-----

At the start of this process, the elephant is nothing but a strange impression

mixing the familiar and the bizarre. We see that it’s an animal, with a
surprisingly large nose, legs like tree trunks, and ears like giant fans. But this
animal doesn’t resemble any we know. It greatly intrigues us and we feel it
deserves a name.

The concept of elephant first emerges in our visual cortex in the form of this

impression. With repeated observations, the image stabilizes and becomes
clearer. At the end of the process, elephants become so natural and familiar to us
that it’s as if we’ve always known what they are.

But what is a concept? Why do we think with concepts? At what level of

reality do they exist? What stuff are they made of? What makes us able to
perceive them?

These questions are among the most ancient in the history of philosophy and,

for millennia, they have been said to be insoluble. Asking these questions, of
course, is asking how our brains work.

Interestingly, the mystery of vision reframes these questions without any

need for abstract or confusing language. It’s a very practical, very down-to-earth
way of asking questions about the inner workings of our intelligence.

## The Worst Metaphor

Our brain is often compared to a computer. This metaphor is correct in two

aspects: both the brain and computers are capable of accomplishing complex
tasks of information processing, and they both make use of electrical signals.

As for all the rest, the metaphor is catastrophically false. It ruins our chance

of understanding what is going on.

A computer is a perfect embodiment of System 2: it’s a machine capable of

mechanically applying long sequences of logical instructions at breathtaking
speeds without making mistakes—something our brain is entirely unable to
accomplish.

A computer is made of a central processing unit where calculations are made

and memory units where information is stored. Between these distinct units,
information circulates at high speeds along electrical circuits without being
transformed. In our brains, it’s quite the contrary. Information circulates slowly
and is transformed along each step of its circulation. Memory, processing, and
circulation are indissoluble.

A computer strings instructions one after the other, sequentially, paced by an

internal clock that ticks billions of times per second. The time it takes to activate


-----

a connection between neurons is on the order of a thousandth of a second. The
base operations of our brain are thus _a million times slower_ than that of a
computer. But our brain isn’t sequential: it processes in parallel _billions and_
_billions_ of these operations.

The silicon circuits of computers are immutable, engraved in an inert

material. Our brain is living tissue that constantly reconfigures itself.

## A Perceptual System

Rather than representing the brain as a system for doing calculations, it’s

much more illuminating to see it as a perceptual system. Our brain is the central
organ through which we perceive the world. It allows us to sense things: for
example, that an elephant is in front of us.

Each neuron in our brain is in itself a tiny perceptual system. Anatomically, a

typical neuron consists of three parts:

—A treelike structure that branches out in thousands of small receptors called

_dendrites._ The dendrites are the receiving end of the neuron.

—A central part called the _soma:_ this is the body of the neuron and contains the

nucleus.

—A kind of trunk or stem called the _axon_ that branches out and ends in what are

called _axon terminals._ This is the transmitter end of the neuron, which
communicates with other neurons.


-----

Neurons are connected to one another in a very specific orientation: the

dendrites of one neuron are plugged into the axon terminals of other neurons,
enabling it to collect information from them. The connections thus formed are
called _synapses._

Neurons exhibit an all-or-nothing type of behavior: they can either be in a

resting state or suddenly “fire up” in full force, in which case an electrical _action_
_potential_ travels down their axon to the terminals, triggering the release into the
synapses of molecules called _neurotransmitters._

These neurotransmitters are in turn detected by the dendrites of receiving

neurons.

To decide whether it should fire up, a neuron essentially conducts a poll. If

enough of its dendrites detect that upstream neurons have just fired up, the
neuron will itself fire up, which in turn may trigger the firing up of downstream
neurons.

A neuron is a perceptual system with a narrow worldview and a binary

response: all it perceives from the world is the activity of the neurons that are
immediately upstream and, apart from resting, all it can do is fire up.

## An Emergent Property


-----

The first time someone tried to explain to me how neurons worked, it didn’t

interest me at all. It didn’t seem to lead anywhere. If our neurons are so
primitive, how can we be intelligent?

The mechanisms of our intelligence are impossible to understand as long as

you try to locate them in a specific place in our brain. Intelligence is what is
called an _emergent property:_ individually our neurons are primitive and limited,
but vast assemblies of neurons make incredibly sophisticated behaviors
“emerge” that can’t be attributed to any neuron by itself—these large-scale
behaviors are what we call _intelligence._

It’s a bit like traffic jams: you can spend twenty years of your life reverse-

engineering cars, but that won’t teach you anything about traffic jams. And yet
traffic jams exist and they’re entirely made up of cars.

An enormous divide separates the individual behavior of our neurons and the

overall functioning of our brain. For a long time, this divide seemed so
enormous that scientists despaired of ever understanding it.

That’s no longer the case. The mystery of vision is now largely resolved. We

don’t understand everything, but what we understand is sufficiently detailed and
makes enough sense that, to some people, it no longer feels like there is a
mystery (although, of course, many deep questions remain open).

First, thanks to progress in neurology, we now have a much better

understanding of the overall organization of our brain and the wiring diagram of
our neurons. It has also become possible to follow in real time the activity of
individual neurons or specific regions of the brain in both humans and animals.

This, in itself, wouldn’t solve the mystery. Brain-imaging technologies are

still incapable of mapping out the entire brain activity with enough resolution to
fully understand what’s going on. We’re still very far from being able to
simultaneously follow, for example, all the neurons at work in recognizing an
elephant—and even further from being able to follow these neurons throughout
the lifelong process of learning.

The most spectacular and compelling breakthrough has come from another

discipline: computer science. Since the 1950s psychologists and computer
scientists have looked for inspiration in the functioning of our neurons and the
anatomy of our cerebral cortex to construct systems of _artificial intelligence._
Because they imitate the architecture of our brain, the behavior of these systems
sheds light on what’s going on in our heads.

Frank Rosenblatt (1928–1971), one of the pioneers of this approach, helped

construct the first mathematical model of a neuron and fashioned a computing
device that implemented this model. But modeling the behavior of complex


-----

neural networks capable of simulating our ability to see was a problem of an
entirely different scale. The technology stumbled along for decades and went
through numerous ups and downs. At some point, the AI community grew so
disillusioned that artificial neural networks were seen as a technological dead
end. Three scientists, Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio,
continued to believe in the approach. History proved them right.

Toward the end of the 2000s their “deep-learning” algorithms had made so

much progress that they had become capable of resolving advanced problems in
the recognition of images, such as the detection of the presence of elephants.

## An Effective Metaphor

Around 2010, when I began to familiarize myself with these algorithms, I

was excited to discover a way of describing the process of understanding that,
for the first time, was compatible with what I had personally experienced.

From the outset in this book, I’ve discussed a number of powerful and

mysterious phenomena that have perplexed me throughout my mathematical
career: mental plasticity, the inevitable ambiguity of human language, the role of
time and trial and error in trying to understand things, the necessity to ask stupid
questions, the feeling of obviousness that comes after the fact.

With deep learning, the process of understanding could be made tangible and

concrete. It had finally become possible to speak of it without invoking some
kind of black magic.

The subject fascinated me so much that I decided to call an end to my career

in mathematics. I had just completed an important cycle in my research in
algebra and geometry, and I saw an opportunity to explore a radically new
theme, one that might be able to shed light on what I’d experienced.

I chose to approach it in the most practical manner possible, by quitting my

academic position and founding an artificial intelligence startup.

To explain the nature of our intelligence and the mechanisms of our thought,

deep learning offers the best metaphor I know of.

## An Elephant Neuron

The first mystery that deep learning allows you to dissipate is that of the

emergence of concepts. In other words, what had been for millennia one of the
liveliest debates in metaphysics was suddenly reincarnated in the realm of
software, confronting us with an undisputable experimental reality: conceptual


-----

thought spontaneously emerges in vast assemblies of artificial neurons subjected
to unstructured data, for example, a flood of images.

Roughly speaking, here’s how it works in the context of vision. Deep-

learning algorithms model our cortex as a neural network with multiple layers.
The first layer is the raw image: a matrix of neurons that represent pixels. The
second layer is formed of neurons whose dendrites are linked with neurons in the
first layer. The third layer is formed of neurons whose dendrites are linked to the
neurons in the second layer, and so on. It’s because the network is made up of
many superimposed layers that it’s called “deep” learning.

In my description of how neurons function, I omitted one important detail:

when a neuron runs a poll of its dendrites to decide whether it should fire up, the
poll isn’t democratic. Each connection in a neural network carries a certain
“weight” that determines how much it counts toward the decision.

When the network is subject to a flood of raw images, it gradually adjusts all

the weights according to a mechanism I’ll explain in a few pages.

It’s through this process of adjusting weights that the network “learns” and

“becomes intelligent.”

When you let a deep-learning algorithm run for a long time, for example, by

making it “learn” from millions and millions of photos taken at random from the
internet, you notice that each neuron gradually comes to specialize in the
detection of a certain “concept.”

The concepts of the first layers are very primitive, while those of the deeper

layers are much more sophisticated.

For example, a neuron in the second layer might specialize in the detection

of a vertical line in the bottom left corner of an image, or in the slight change in
luminosity in another region of the image. It will fire up exclusively when this
element is present.

In the third layer the concepts become slightly more sophisticated. For

example, a neuron might detect certain types of angles between two segments
situated in a certain zone of the image.

As you get further into the network, the concepts grow in richness and

abstraction. They become more and more “deep.” In the fifth layer, certain
neurons might, for example, specialize in the detection of triangles or certain
types of curves.

In the twentieth layer, a neuron might specialize in the detection of elephants

—whether they’re real or drawn.

This way of presenting things is purposely simplistic. The reality is more

complicated than that, and the correspondence between neurons and concepts


-----

isn’t necessarily that direct. Specific experiments do suggest that, for each
famous actor or actress you know, you really have a specific neuron that reacts
specifically to his or her presence on the screen (see “Notes and Further
Reading” section). But some scientists think that concepts correspond to groups
of neurons rather than individual neurons. In computer simulations, individual
neurons sometimes specialize in the detection of high-level objects such as
elephants, but in other instances this detection mobilizes a whole group of
neurons rather than a specific one.

While simplistic, this model does capture some of the most salient aspects of

our cognitive processes. Saying that in your brain there is a dedicated elephant
neuron is a bit of a stretch, but it’s an illuminating one. This is why we’ll
proceed as if it really were the case.

## One Hundred Trillion Filaments

Your elephant neuron has thousands of dendrites. Your personal definition of

an elephant involves thousands of criteria, which are themselves abstract
attributes at a fairly high level, such as “is an animal,” “has a trunk,” “has big
ears,” “is gray,” “is big,” “trumpets,” “has ivory tusks,” “has rough skin,”
“moves in such and such manner,” and so on.

Each of these attributes has its own weight. It’s a good bet that “has a trunk”

has a high weight, because having a trunk is a highly relevant feature. Your
elephant neuron calculates an “elephantness score” by adding up the weights of
the attributes whose neurons are activated.

Once the score passes a certain threshold, the neuron decides that you’re

dealing with an elephant. Beneath this threshold there’s a gray zone where
you’re not sure it’s an elephant (and where someone else might have a different
opinion), then a zone where it’s clearly not an elephant.

It’s the large number of criteria at play that makes your elephant-detection

system so robust and reliable. Your elephantness score is sufficiently well
sampled to stay relevant in unforeseen situations and to tolerate a large variety of
anomalies.

The exact definition is evidently impossible to write. An entire book

wouldn’t be enough, and at any rate you’d never find the words.

This tangle of 100 trillion neural connections is the spider’s web

Wittgenstein was talking about. It’s unthinkable to unravel all of that. But
without unraveling all of that, there’s no chance of being able to define anything.

Deep-learning algorithms, even the most powerful and sophisticated, are


-----

only gross simplifications of our cerebral architecture. Our cortex is indeed
structured in layers, though not as strictly and narrowly as in computer models:
your “elephant” neuron polls your “trunk” neuron, but your “trunk” neuron itself
certainly polls your “elephant” neuron. The circularity of definitions is
impossible to avoid.

It is also an oversimplification to imagine that our brains are organized in

specialized regions perfectly isolated from each other: vision happens within a
broader context and, at any rate, your definition of elephant isn’t entirely visual.

## The Organic Process of Learning

It remains to describe the process of learning itself: what mechanisms do the

neurons rely on to determine the “weight” of their connections with other
neurons?

Let’s go back to the example of your elephant neuron. It is constantly

analyzing the state of its upstream neurons to decide whether or not it should fire
up. You’re scrutinizing the world in real time, on the watch for elephants. (It’s
always an abuse of language to speak of “real time,” because no system actually
functions in real time. It takes a neuron around half a millisecond to fire up.)

In chapter 11 , we called this _System 1,_ instantaneous intuitive thinking, that

which gives you the impression of thinking as fast as lightning.

In parallel to this, another phenomenon takes place in the background. It

happens at a much slower pace, and is so discrete that we can’t perceive it. The
correct metaphor isn’t lightning, but organic growth. It’s the process through
which we learn. It’s the basis of what we have called _System 3,_ our ability to
gradually modify the way we represent the world to ourselves.

If one day you come across an elephant without a trunk, you’d be surprised.
What does it mean “to be surprised”? A trunkless elephant surprises you

because your vision of the world hadn’t anticipated it. That still doesn’t keep you
from understanding. You’d almost certainly still see that it’s an elephant, while
having the disturbing feeling that something’s terribly wrong.

When you mathematically model a deep-learning system, you can define a

numerical quantity that measures its “perplexity” in a given situation. A system
that learns is one that adjusts its weights in order to reduce its perplexity.

Intuitively, this is what perplexity means. In your elephantness score,

“having a trunk” carries a pretty high weight, because elephants and trunks
usually come together. While the other criteria will allow you to compensate and
“see” an elephant despite the absence of a trunk, it’s an abnormal situation and


-----

you feel it _physically,_ whether you’re aware of it or not.

Your elephant neuron is perplexed. It detected an elephant, yet there was no

trunk, and up to this point trunks were supposed to be an essential feature. The
neuron factors in this new reality by slightly diminishing the associated weight.
If you continue to come across elephants without trunks, you’d end up by hardly
taking this criterion into account at all.

In reality there’s no need to have such large abnormalities for your neurons

to correct their weights. They’re constantly, if slightly, in adjustment with each
stimulation. Physiologically, that corresponds to the ability of synaptic
connections to strengthen or weaken. New connections are created and others
disappear. Our mental circuitry is constantly reconfiguring itself.

Mental plasticity is nothing more than this: the decentralized action of your

neurons that, individually, seek to reinforce the consistency of their score.

The most extraordinary thing—and it’s been perfectly demonstrated

experimentally thanks to deep-learning algorithms—is that such simple
mechanisms allow high-level abstract concepts, such as elephants, to gradually
emerge, starting from a state of departure where the connections and weights are
chosen at random.

You weren’t born with an elephant neuron. The first time you saw one, you

were greatly perplexed: your “animal” neuron was excited, as well as your
“enormous thing that deserves my full attention” neuron, as well as many other
neurons corresponding to the many attributes you could recognize. But this
powerful and complex impression had no name. You looked at it carefully, to
take it in and to learn.

In your head, the elephant was at first a composite object, mobilizing a large

number among the 100 billion neurons in your brain. One of the neurons that
fired up during this first elephantine encounter had a special destiny. Little by
little, by gradually adjusting its weights, it became more and more specialized.
Over time, it _became_ your elephant neuron.

Concepts emerge in deep-learning networks under the simple effect of

exposure to the world. They emerge literally out of nothing, as waves are formed
on a flat ocean by the effect of the wind: initially, there are just tiny random
irregularities on the surface of the water, but these irregularities are then
amplified by feedback mechanisms, following laws of physics that are simple to
describe on the microscopic level and that, on a greater scale, give rise to
incredibly complex emergent phenomena.

## Abstract and Vague

The scientific, technological, and philosophical implications of all this go far

beyond the scope of this book. Here’s how we can sum it up as far as our needs
go.

Our brain, like any animal brain, is a perceptual machine that constantly

fabricates abstractions. We construct and we maintain a representation of the
material world through the tangled network of our neural connections. This
representation of the world is a piling up of layers upon layers of abstractions.
Down to its very core, it’s conceptual in nature.

Conceptual thought isn’t a human privilege. It doesn’t arise from our

language or our culture. When saying this, I’m using the word _thought_ in a very
broad sense, to designate the neurological processes that constitute the substrate
of our intelligence. Any lion thinks in a conceptual manner, and has an elephant
neuron in its head.

The flaws of our language are but a reflection of its neurological

underpinnings. The meanings that we assign to words are perceptual: we know
how to recognize an elephant but we can never really define what it is.

Every definition is an approximation. The meaning of words is always fluid,

ambiguous, changing. Nothing is ever clear-cut. Inside our head, the world is
abstract and vague.

## 20
 A Mathematical Awakening

All throughout my mathematical journey, despite my taste for math and the

pleasure it brought me, I’ve always had the impression that the real challenge
was elsewhere.

What really mattered, what motivated me and made me want to continue,

wasn’t the theorems that I could prove and that would interest only a few
specialists, but something else. This other thing was much more profound and
much more universal.

It even seemed to be incredibly important. Yet I couldn’t really explain what

it was, and I wasn’t even able to give it a name.

This troubled me for many years. I had the weird feeling, which is familiar to

many creative mathematicians, that something was going on, something unclear
that deserved an explanation. I had no idea what it was, but I knew that it had to
do with human understanding. That gave me a rough idea of which direction to
follow.

Mathematical research seemed to me to be the best way to approach it. I was

like an explorer who set out to discover an unknown continent that is barely
sketched out on the map. I had no idea what I’d find, but it was perfectly clear
from the start that, in reality, I was seeking to discover myself.

This book is the story of my adventure. I lived through it so I could tell the

tale.

Years have passed and I’m finally able to put into words the thing that, at the

time, seemed so strange and unclear to me. It’s the subject of this final chapter.

## Fallen from the Sky

When I was a PhD student and someone asked me about the usefulness of

my research, I sidestepped the question with a joke: “It will be used in physics in


-----

a thousand years.”

I was very skeptical about the practical applications of contemporary

mathematical research. The past twenty years have changed my mind.

All the technological objects that you use in your day-to-day life are

designed and built using advanced mathematics. Every piece of information that
is recorded or transmitted over a distance can only be so thanks to sophisticated
mathematical processing. Every time you interact with your smartphone, you
interact with interwoven stacks of mathematical abstractions.

For centuries, math has played a prominent role in science and technology.

The digitization of our world and our lives has amplified this phenomenon by
orders of magnitudes. There’s no possible doubt that math is technologically
useful, and getting more and more so by the day.

Math already is, in fact, frighteningly useful.
However, when put in a broader historical perspective, the mathematization

of the world appears as a recent phenomenon. It dates back to Descartes and just
before him Galileo, who famously declared that the universe was a book
“written in the language of mathematics.”

Prior to the seventeenth century, science wasn’t mathematized. Mathematics

didn’t really have any application. It still consisted of the “childish and
pointless” exercises in arithmetic and geometry that Descartes was so upset
about. That hadn’t prevented the ancient Greeks from making it a prerequisite
for philosophy.

No offense to Galileo, but the notion that mathematics is the language of the

universe doesn’t make any sense to me. I’m equally skeptical when I hear that
math is useful primarily through its applications in science and technology. This
way of talking about math makes the whole history of science totally
incomprehensible: How did mathematicians find a way to get acquainted with
the language of the universe? Did mathematics fall from the sky? Was it sent by
God? Why did the ancient Greeks, who hadn’t figured out that it was the
language of the universe, still insisted on teaching mathematics?

What could have motivated its development over those millennia when it

served no practical purpose?

## The True Mathematics

Presenting mathematics as an external tool is the surest way to make us hate

it. Official math, with its sharp edges, its cold logic, its unbearable air of
superiority, is impossible to fall in love with. But as we’ve seen, there is another


-----

way.

I’ve spoken in this book about how I used my intuition to get ahead in math.

At least that’s what I believed I was doing at first, when I still thought that what
counted was the official math, the stuff in the books.

As I matured, I came to the realization that it worked the other way around. I

was using math to develop my intuition.

Math is first and foremost an inner tool. Its main purpose is to enhance

human cognition. With the correct exercises of imagination, we have the ability
to develop an intuitive and familiar understanding of mathematical notions. We
can appropriate them and make them an extension of our bodies.

The true math is the secret math, the one that extends our intuitive

understanding of the world that surrounds us.

You already have access to this inner math. You know how to manipulate a

circle in your head. You sense the presence of the number 999,999,999 right
there in front of you. When you look at the world, you recognize numbers and
geometric shapes.

In your head, mathematical concepts behave differently than other concepts.

They’re much more difficult to learn. But once in place, they provide you with
mental images of an incomparable clarity and stability. This is made possible by
the unique properties of mathematical truth and logical formalism.

You were a child when you first learned about elephants. Then you learned

that there are two different kinds and you could tell them apart by the size of
their ears. Now you know that there are three distinct species of elephants. Who
knows how many there’ll be tomorrow?

With the number 2, you’ll never run into such issues. Mathematical truth ties

mathematical concepts together to form a mental matrix that is uniquely
coherent and stable. It may be difficult to explain what the number 2 really is,
but you know that 2 + 2 = 4 and that it’s not going to change.

Your mathematical intuition will never become perfect, but logic and

mathematical truth enable you to continually refine and recalibrate it.

Even if you think you’re terrible at math, the conceptual matrix formed by

the math that already lives inside your head is the most solid anchor point of
your relationship to the world. Without numbers, without circles and squares,
without your perception of points and trajectories in a three-dimensional space,
without _x_ and _y,_ without the concepts of distance, speed, and acceleration,
without the idea that a straight line can continue infinitely, without probabilities,
without addition and multiplication, without the very notion of truth and logical
reasoning, the whole world around you would suddenly become so blurred and


-----

unsteady that you’d feel like you’d been lobotomized.

The math that you understand augments reality and adds a magical layer of

intelligibility. It makes you hyperlucid.

With time, this math has become so concrete and obvious to you, so “real,”

that it no longer feels like math. By comparison, the math that you don’t yet
understand will always seem abstract, absurd, “imaginary.”

And yet these concepts that seem so evident and deeply embedded in you

weren’t always in the picture. It’s difficult to believe, but things as simple as
whole numbers required people to seek them out, through the power of thought,
in the confines of human understanding. They first felt them hatching in the fog
of their intuition. Then they struggled to put words to them. They worked to
make these words simple and accessible, so that everyone could end up seeing
them clearly.

Inside the heads of mathematicians today, there’s a thousand times more than

all you’ve been taught.

Mathematics isn’t the language of the universe. It’s the language that allows

us to speak with clarity and precision of all the things that we can’t point to with
our fingers. It’s the language that makes us capable of reasoning and doing
science. It’s the language that’s made us what we are, for better and for worse.

This way of approaching math, as a technique of mental reprogramming and

extension of human perception, is fairly recent. It’s a vision that had been in the
air for some time without anyone taking the time to clarify it and make it
accessible to the general public—at least until quite recently.

It is beautifully expressed in these striking lines written by Thurston in 2011:

“Mathematics is commonly thought to be the pursuit of universal truths, of
patterns that are not anchored to any single fixed context. But on a deeper level
the goal of mathematics is to develop enhanced ways for humans to see and
think about the world. Mathematics is a transforming journey, and progress in it
can be better measured by changes in how we think than by the external truths
we discover.”

## A Work of Fiction

There remains one crucial point, perhaps the most important of the book.
The weird feeling that had troubled me throughout the years had nothing to

do with the question of what math is good for.

People who ask that question don’t do math. People who do math know quite

well it’s good for something, if only to give them pleasure, that magical feeling


-----

of seeing the world become more and more illuminated the further they progress
in math.

The weird feeling had more to do with the actual experience of becoming a

mathematician and what it felt like internally. It wasn’t like anything I was
prepared for. Something really strange was going on.

I’m going to explain what it was, but before I do, I first need to make a few

observations on what is quite possibly the most disconcerting aspect of math: the
constant reference to things that don’t exist “for real” and that you have to try to
imagine anyway.

The most simple and fundamental advice you can give to people who want to

understand math, which I’ve repeated throughout this book, is to pretend the
things are really there, right in front of you, and that you can reach out and touch
them.

People who don’t understand math are basically stuck in a state of disbelief.

They’re refusing to imagine things that don’t actually exist, because they don’t
see the point. It just makes no sense to them.

I admit that it’s disconcerting, but the only way to give meaning to

mathematics is to imagine that the things it’s talking about really exist.
Grothendieck is very transparent about it in this passage, which I’ve previously
cited: “All my life I’ve been unable to read a mathematical text, however trivial
or simple it may be, unless I’m able to give this text a ‘meaning’ in terms of my
experience of mathematical things, that is unless the text arouses in me mental
images, intuitions that will give it life.”

As we’ve seen, there’s nothing grandiose or sophisticated about these mental

images. They’re always childish, always simplistic, and almost always plainly
wrong. When mathematicians think about spheres, they imagine them more or
less the same way you do.

Mathematicians are human beings. They can understand mathematical

objects only in a perceptual manner, via _false_ human interpretations,
approximations, translations from mathematical vocabulary into human
language.

In fact, this is precisely why math is so beneficial for us: it forces us to

enrich our _human_ vocabulary and our _human_ perception.

On the other hand, mathematicians always keep in mind that their mental

pictures are only an approximation of the truth, and they’re constantly looking to
find out how their pictures are false.

Real spheres exist elsewhere, in a sort of parallel universe. Knowing whether

or not this parallel universe really exists is a useless debate, since it’s


-----

inaccessible anyway. Some mathematicians are convinced that it exists, others
are convinced that it doesn’t—and still others, like me, couldn’t care either way.

The only thing that counts (and this is where it really becomes disconcerting)

is that you must imperatively act “as if” this parallel universe existed, because if
you don’t mathematics is nothing more than a bunch of cryptic symbols on a
piece of paper.

This explains the insistence of mathematicians on speaking of _mathematical_

_objects_ to designate what most people call _mathematical abstractions._

In other words, from a purely practical standpoint, math is indistinguishable

from fiction.

Learning math is an activity of pure imagination. We bring mathematical

objects into our heads through the power of thought and keep them together
there through the cohesive effect of a mysterious ingredient, which in a way is
the true hero of the fiction: mathematical truth.

Of all the mathematical concepts, truth is at once the simplest and the most

difficult to explain. If you want to explain the number 2, you can hold up two
oranges. If you want to explain what a triangle is, you can point to a triangle. But
what can you hold up or point to in order to explain what truth is for
mathematicians?

Believe it or not, the fiction works. Mathematicians develop new ways of

approaching reality and new ways of thinking that, throughout history, have
demonstrated their effectiveness.

The objects of the fiction, via their concrete and intuitive incarnation,

become new concepts that enrich our understanding of the world. It’s as if they
stepped out of the fiction to become “real,” incarnate, like the number 2 becomes
real when we see two oranges.

In the process of returning to reality, all mathematical objects lose their

perfection, but they conserve the essential characteristics that made them what
they were in the fiction. An orange may not be a real sphere, but it’s still round.

All mathematical objects, that is, save one. The central character stays stuck

in the fiction, as nothing in the real world even remotely resembles mathematical
truth.

The moment the dream fades away, mathematical truth instantly vanishes,

like a genie going back into its bottle.

## An Imaginary Friend

I haven’t yet explained what was causing my weird feeling, but it’s quite


-----

possible that you’re starting to experience a weird feeling of your own.

And, to be honest, there is indeed something weird. Not only is there a

disconnect between the assumed “rationality” of mathematicians and the
strangeness of what they actually do, but the deeper we dig, the stranger it
becomes.

I am not aware of any other human activity that involves such a violent back-

and-forth between reality and fiction. Seen in this light, the approach as a whole
seems utterly insane and doomed from the start. It’s a bit like mathematicians
were having conversations with an imaginary friend who lets them in on secrets
about the world around them. How could this have the slightest chance of
success?

This intrinsic weirdness has clouded the understanding of mathematics

throughout its history.

There are so-called “imaginary” numbers that are neither more nor less

imaginary than so-called “real” numbers, which are neither more nor less real
than so-called “rational” numbers.

Each time a new type of number was introduced, it provoked a lot of unease,

not only among the public but also among mathematicians themselves, including
those who had introduced the new numbers.

In the nineteenth century, there were still serious mathematicians who

claimed that negative numbers were nothing but a fairy tale. In the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries even their advocates labeled them _absurd numbers._ Since
then, it’s as if reality itself had changed, and decided to switch sides. These
previously absurd numbers have become concrete and familiar. They’ve taken
over everyday life. To prove to yourself that negative numbers aren’t fairy tales,
you just have to open a bank account.

As we saw, Cantor was labeled a “scientific charlatan,” a “renegade,” a

“corruptor of youth” for having talked about infinity calmly and precisely. What
people really reproached him for was having made tangible what should have
stayed evanescent. From a theological perspective, mathematics is unfair
competition.

“The essence of mathematics is its freedom,” declared Cantor. The freedom

of mathematicians is to treat “imaginary” things as “real” things from the
moment they are “true.” In the end they even see them as being “obvious.”

It happens that this approach works remarkably well. Mathematicians

obviously aren’t going to stop when things are going so well. They continue to
amuse themselves with the supernatural or miraculous nature of their
constructions. They manipulate “ideals” and “vanishing spectra.” The famous


-----

“monstrous moonshine conjectures” (named after the “Monster,” an object that
lives in dimension 196,883) were proved using a “no-ghost theorem.” In algebra,
there’s a construction called the _Eilenberg swindle._

If the process of understanding math is already quite bizarre, the discovery

process is even more so. The experience is so singular and disconcerting that
most accounts look like they were written by mystics.

One of the most baffling aspects is the abrupt manner in which ideas come to

you, without effort and almost always inconveniently. They emerge, as
Grothendieck puts it, “as if summoned from the void.”

In an influential research article by Bob Thomason and Tom Trobaugh,

we’re told that the second author contributed only after he was dead, by means
of appearing in a dream of the first author. Not only did he suggest the right
approach, he stopped the first author from readily dismissing it as hopeless:
“Tom’s simulacrum had been so insistent, I knew he wouldn’t let me sleep
undisturbed until I had worked out the argument.”

One of my close friends, an excellent mathematician whose name I won’t

disclose, recently told me that he had the distinct impression (which he never
dared share with others) that the greatest ideas in his career had been directly
suggested by God (even though he’s an avowed atheist).

For my part, I’ve never felt anything along those lines. I’ve simply had the

impression of being able to levitate and pass through walls.

## Well-Guarded Secrets

That was the weird thing. The more I advanced, the further I dove into the

heart of mathematics, the more I learned to master the techniques that facilitate
deep understanding and creativity, the more it began to resemble witchcraft and
black magic.

Descartes thought that mathematicians guarded their secrets for fear of losing

their prestige. If people knew that there was a method and it was that simple, he
reckoned, they would stop looking at mathematicians like they were demigods,
and come to the realization that they’re just normal people.

The real explanation is undoubtedly more trivial: mathematicians are simply

afraid of being called insane.

If I hadn’t become one of them myself, I might have continued to believe

that they were demigods capable of speaking the language of the universe. But I
know it’s not true. I know where I come from. I saw what made me get better.
Each key step was always the more or less fortuitous discovery of a new


-----

technique to overcome my inhibitions or a new way of making my imagination
work.

In practice, mathematics doesn’t have much to do with the hard sciences. It’s

rather more related to psychology, of which it’s a kind of esoteric and applied
sub-branch.

It’s undeniable that mathematical creation feels magical and supernatural.

But behind all that there’s necessarily a human reality that is neither supernatural
nor magical.

What really troubled me and made me want to continue to explore these

subjects until I felt able to tell the story in a simple manner was an immense
feeling of waste.

No other human project has the prestige and intellectual authority as that of

mathematics. If mathematicians are incapable of explaining their approach
without giving the impression that they’re some kind of shamans, that doesn’t
mean they’re actual shamans.

It simply means that they’re not using the right words and that their

explanation is incomplete.

## The Right Way of Waving My Hands

Why is it so hard to teach math? Why has this been so for centuries and

centuries? What do we fail to share and communicate? What exactly are we
missing?

I studied math because I couldn’t understand how it was possible to

understand it. I expected someone would explain to me _why_ it was possible and
_how_ to do it. The explanation never came. The subject was never even raised.

That didn’t stop me from learning on my own. Like so many others, I

experienced the frustration of staying silent about the aspect of mathematics that,
for me, was of the most value.

Each time I found myself in a situation of teaching or explaining my work, I

tried to bring together two levels of discourse: a formal level made of rigorous
definitions and precise statements, and an intuitive level, with the right
metaphors, the right drawings, the right inflection of my voice, the right way of
waving my hands.

These two levels complement one another. A formal lecture without

motivation and without sharing your intuition is meaningless. But a purely
intuitive discourse without any formalization is equally meaningless—this is
why attempts at popularizing math so often miss the mark. Once you get rid of


-----

official math, intuition loses its moorings.

There is an inherent limit to how much math can be taught without formal

definitions and formal statements. At some point, without formalism, it’s no
longer mathematics, it’s just people waving their hands.

Shortly before quitting academia, I had the opportunity to give the most

interesting course of my career. It was a semester-long introductory math course
for literature and philosophy students at the école normale supérieure, one of the
most prestigious universities in France.

It was an opportunity to experiment, and confront myself with this

fundamental question: can you teach the art of seeing math in your head?

I plunged back into what are traditionally called the _foundations_ of

mathematics: logic and set theory. That’s when I realized that I had been going
about it the wrong way. Logic and set theory are not _foundations_ of
mathematics, they are _branches_ of mathematics. Their focus is the mathematical
formalization of the notion of proof—a perfectly legitimate field of study, but
one that won’t bring much clarity to what math really is, let alone how to teach
it.

Certain ideas and examples in this book go back directly to my class notes

from this time. Back then, however, I was missing a crucial ingredient.

In my class, I constantly felt that something wasn’t right, as if I hadn’t

managed to situate the conversation in the right place. I loved the math that was
alive inside of me, but I was unable to explain it in words that others could relate
to.

It was in this context that I called an end to my scientific career. Decisions of

this kind are never easy to make. Trying to pinpoint a single factor that explains
it all would be naïve. Among the multitude of factors, there was, however, this
particular frustration: I wasn’t able to teach math in a meaningful way. I could
teach what math was supposed to be, but I couldn’t teach what it really was for
me. Somehow, it felt as if this sincere level of teaching wasn’t permitted, as if an
ancient taboo was preventing it from happening.

With hindsight, it’s now clear that my introductory course was simply

missing a discussion of the human experience of understanding mathematics.

## The Impossible Story

Euclid’s _Elements_ is the most influential mathematics treatise in history. It

dates back twenty-three hundred years and, throughout the centuries, it has come
to serve as a blueprint for mathematical reasoning itself.


-----

Since this time, mathematics has been presented as the science of logical

deduction. The other part of the story, that which concerns the unseen actions
that we perform in our heads, has been obscured. This is of course no
conspiracy. A more plausible explanation is that, for twenty-three hundred years,
this other part of the story was simply impossible to tell.

Telling the story would have required explaining what was going on in our

heads, and we had no satisfying way of representing the inner workings of our
own intelligence.

The only model we could think of was that of mechanical deductive

reasoning, in the spirit of Euclid’s _Elements._ Viewing intelligence as the ability
to perform _calculations_ is as old as math itself. “Calculation” comes from the
Latin _calculus,_ which means “small pebble,” referring to the stones used on an
abacus for counting. Across the centuries, the brain was compared to an abacus,
then a geared computing machine, then a silicon chip. The metaphor conflated
mechanical deductive reasoning with mathematics and rationality—and with
intelligence itself.

As we’ve seen, this metaphor is deeply flawed. This profound

misinterpretation of our brain processes has made us unable to relate
mathematics to the common human experience.

Ironically, we’ve always known that our intelligence couldn’t be reduced to

calculations. We’ve known deep inside that something else was going on. Yet
we had no way to evoke it without having recourse to the supernatural. We were
stuck with _spirits_ and _intuitions, third eyes_ and _sixth senses._ We imagined
magical entities acting outside of our control, and with which only a small elite,
endowed with a special gift, had the privilege of being able to directly
communicate. These models had remained practically unchanged since
prehistory.

Our language itself was a mystery. Who invented words? What is a concept?

What is meaning? What is truth? How are we able to even make sense of
phrases? For millennia, these weren’t even science questions—they belonged to
the fields of metaphysics and theology.

To understand math is to reprogram your intuition. It is, above all, a matter

of neuroplasticity. The secret techniques of mathematicians are neither more nor
less paranormal than those that allowed Ben Underwood to see the world by
clicking his tongue.

As long as we treated our mental activity as something magical, mathematics

was fundamentally impossible to explain. But as we’re entering the age of
artificial intelligence, we may finally have an opening.


-----

It was my encounter with deep-learning algorithms that enabled me to write

this book. For the first time in my life, I had access to a brain metaphor that
allowed me to make sense of my own journey. I realized that my testimonial had
value, as I could describe my subjective experience in terms that were
sufficiently clear, sufficiently “rational,” to escape the safe confines of private
conversations.

This is how I ceased to view my story as an impossible story.
When I look at them with the deep-learning metaphor in mind, the strange

phenomena that have troubled me for so many years suddenly cease being
strange to me. Yes, ideas come unexpectedly, “as if summoned from the void,”
but that’s normal. Yes, plasticity is a slow and silent mechanism that occurs
without any real effort on our part, provided we’re exposed to the right mental
images. Yes, we learn precisely when we force ourselves to imagine things _that_
_we don’t yet understand,_ which unfortunately is the same exact thing that most
people run away from. Yes, paying attention to the small details that trouble us is
of the utmost importance, and the fastest way to learn is to follow the path of
maximum perplexity. Cartesian doubt, within this framework, can be interpreted
as an “adversarial” hack to accelerate our learning.

## A Mathematical Awakening

For millennia, we presented mathematics in a way that made it unintelligible

to most people. We finally have the opportunity to talk about it differently.

Learning math should be like learning any other motor skill, like learning to

swim or ride a bike, and it should be accessible to everyone. Our false beliefs
about the nature of our language and the functioning of our thought are obstacles
to this simple and direct learning. They instill fears and inhibitions that block the
unseen actions without which no mathematical learning can take place.

How do you teach math to someone who believes that their intuition and

perception of reality are given and impossible to reprogram? It’s exactly like
teaching swimming to someone who is convinced their body is as dense as rock
and will sink. A prelude to any successful teaching is getting rid of such beliefs.

This is why I conceived of this book as a book of awakening and

emancipation. I believe that mathematics has taught me important lessons about
our bodies, how they function, and what we can accomplish with them, and I
wanted to share those lessons.

I’ve tried to speak as candidly as possible about what goes on inside our

heads: the subjective reality, the emotional journey, the physical and sensorial


-----

experience, the practical aspects of what we do, how we do it, how it works, and
what it feels like. None of that has ever been part of teaching, because it wasn’t
supposed to be part of math, and also because of our deeply ingrained suspicion
toward anything subjective.

I’m well aware of the shortcomings of subjectivity. “I know how likely we

are to be wrong on our own account,” wrote Descartes, and the situation hasn’t
improved since his time.

But do we really have a choice? When mathematics was just about proving

theorems, it was entirely natural to treat the subjective experience as a secondrate citizen, to be covered only informally and anecdotally, if time allowed. But
as soon as we realize that mathematics is ultimately about human understanding,
this ceases to be an option. Understanding is, in essence, a subjective experience.

My personal story would be of little value if it was simply that of “one with a

gift.” While I cannot prove that I have no special talent, I know for a fact that I
was myself extremely intimidated by the notion that creative mathematicians had
to be biologically different, and would have given up if I hadn’t found a way to
get rid of it.

From the outside, it indeed seems that mathematical creativity requires some

sort of superhuman intelligence. To stop thinking in terms of “gifts” and
“talents,” one has to find an alternate explanation.

My way of looking at things, which has served me well throughout my

career, was to imagine that creative mathematicians were hackers who had found
ways to unlock “hidden modes” of our cognition. Most of the time, they’d done
so unwittingly, and were entirely incapable of explaining how.

It’s also the hypothesis that’s guided me throughout the writing of this book.

I concentrated on the few things that I knew firsthand, and thus on a small part
of the subject.

I was fortunate enough to be able to rely on the writings of Descartes,

Grothendieck, and Thurston. Their stories closely resemble one another, as if it
were the same story told from three different points of view. These stories are
compatible with what I’ve lived through myself, which allowed me to inscribe
my personal journey within a tradition that’s older, stronger, and more richly
documented.

Even they didn’t have all the keys. Descartes was unable to account for what

happened to him without making the _dualist_ assumption that his mind was of a
divine and immaterial essence, detached from his body. Similarly, Grothendieck
was convinced that God whispered in his ear and dreamed inside his head.
Thurston is the most pragmatic of the three, the most modern, and without doubt


-----

the most lucid.

Their candor and sense of detail are of utmost value. They tried their best to

share what they’d lived through and what, in their view, accounted for their
success.

From the first page to the last, they speak almost only of imagination. Each

describes the use of imagination in new modalities, discovered by accident and
breaking with what they’d been taught.

Grothendieck attributes the singularity of his work to his transgression of a

taboo: “It would seem that among all the natural sciences, it is only in
mathematics that what I call ‘the dream’ or ‘the daydream’ is struck with an
apparently absolute interdiction, more than two millennia old.”

Thurston puts it in a less grandiose but equally impactful fashion: “I have

decided that daydreaming is not a bug but a feature.”

Descartes, himself an avid daydreamer, left us with a compelling account of

his powerful techniques. But, by a cruel irony, he’s also responsible for the
flawed theory that is making it so hard for us to take him seriously.

Imagination is the key to this entire story. Mathematicians have found a

unique way to use theirs and it has made them incredibly successful.
Mathematical imagination is all the more visionary and limitless in that it is
guided by _mathematical truth,_ the secret ingredient that makes it possible to
figure out _the right things to imagine,_ the ones that will eventually solidify and
expand our intuitive understanding of the world around us. This is where the true
foundations of mathematics are to be found, and not in formal logic or theology.

But under a narrow-minded version of rationalism, none of this can make

any sense.

We’ve been taught that our thoughts have no impact on reality. For an

educated person, it takes a lot of guts to affirm otherwise. We read here and
there that one can change the world by the power of thought, but we’re trained to
dismiss it as mysticism or self-help bluster.

This is dualism at its finest. Our thoughts are presumed to be ethereal. You

can imagine whatever you wish, however you wish, without that having any
impact whatsoever on the physical world.

Yet using our imagination isn’t navigating an ethereal layer of the cosmos.

Nor is it a parasitical activity that we should seek to suppress. It is, instead, a
genuine physical activity that is central to human cognition.

What we see and do _in our heads_ contributes to neural learning every bit as

much as what we see and do _for real._ If we feel the urge to perform unseen
actions in our heads, if we dream and if we daydream, it’s because this allows us


-----

to _fabricate understanding._ What we imagine modifies the actual wiring of our
brain and literally _changes the way we see the world._

There are a thousand and one ways to imagine. We haven’t yet learned to

recognize them all, and still less to name them. _Think, meditate, reflect,_
_visualize, analyze, fantasize, reason, dream:_ we use these words haphazardly,
without really knowing what they mean, and without realizing how much they
have in common.

It’s through this vagueness that all the misunderstandings slip in. No one

cared to even tell us that there are right and wrong ways of using our
imagination. Some make us stupid. Some make us crazy. And some have the
power of making us incredibly smart.

Now that we’re teaching machines the secrets of intelligence, it’s about time

we start teaching humans.

## Epilogue

Early in 1913, G. H. Hardy, an eminent mathematician at the University of

Cambridge, received a strange letter from Madras, India.

The writer was a man named Srinivasa Ramanujan. He said he was a twenty-

three-year-old clerk living in poverty, without any higher education, who spent
his free time studying mathematics on his own. He accompanied his letter with a
selection of theorems he claimed to have obtained and that the local
mathematicians had deemed “surprising.” He was curious to hear Hardy’s
opinion.

Hardy gave the theorems a quick glance. He thought at first it was some kind

of a hoax. However, the more he looked at the manuscript, the more perplexed
he became. Not only did the results seem credible, their depth and originality
were extraordinary, and Hardy felt completely blown away.

The theorems were given without proofs. Hardy himself was incapable of

proving them. He thought, however, that “they must be true because, if they
were not true, no one would have had the imagination to invent them.”

Hardy therefore concluded that Ramanujan was a mathematician of the

highest order, who would take his place among the greatest in history.

## Formalism and Intuition

The story of the encounter and friendship between Hardy and Ramanujan is

so improbable that you’d think it was taken from fiction.

It can be read as a social fable. At the height of British colonial domination,

two worlds collide. Hardy is a pure product of Western intellectual arrogance, a
member of the most elite circles, comfortably ensconced in his ivory tower.
Ramanujan is a self-taught amateur mathematician, the son of a sari vendor.

Hardy invites Ramanujan to Cambridge, where he lives for five years, from

1914 until 1919, when, gravely ill, he decides to return to India, where he dies
the following year at the age of thirty-two.

At the end of his career, when Hardy was asked about his greatest

contribution to mathematics, he replied without hesitation “the discovery of
Ramanujan.”

Hardy had reason to be proud. He had immediately recognized the

extraordinary genius of Ramanujan. He’d had the courage and integrity to act on
this even though it meant going against established norms. Ramanujan was the
first Indian to be elected as a fellow of Trinity College and one of the youngest
fellows of the Royal Society.

On another level, the story can also be read as a mathematical fable. It


-----

reprises the principal themes we’ve addressed in this book and constitutes the
perfect epilogue.

From the beginning of this book, we’ve talked about how mathematics feeds

on the tension between two contradictory forces: the inhuman coldness of logical
formalism and the phenomenal power of intuition. All mathematical work,
whether the resolution of a primary school exercise or research that extends the
boundaries of human knowledge, requires a constant dialogue between
formalism and intuition.

Not everyone approaches this dialogue in the same manner. Some

mathematicians are spontaneously more “formalist,” while others are more
profoundly “intuitive.” Yet they all know that in order to progress they need to
reach out to both sides.

The duo act formed by Hardy and Ramanujan is all the more fascinating in

that they are perfect incarnations, almost to the point of caricature, of these two
polarities.

Hardy was one of the most famous mathematicians of his time and one of the

principal figures in the formalist revolution that, at the beginning of the
twentieth century, allowed for the unification of mathematics and the
formalization of the notion of proof.

Hardy was a friend of Bertrand Russell, the coauthor (along with Alfred

North Whitehead) of the most inhuman book in the history of thought: _Principia_
_Mathematica._ In an ultra-formalist style verging on the delirious, this treatise
(whose title alludes to Newton’s great work) provides axiomatic foundations to
set theory, solidifying Cantor’s initial vision and demonstrating along the way
that the concept of numbers can be reconstructed from the concept of sets.

This monumental work changed the face of mathematics. Conceived for the

ages, it was unfortunately disfigured by a nasty birth defect: it was
indecipherable to any person of normal understanding. If you’re looking for the
proof that 1 + 1 = 2, you’ll find it on page 379.

Upon the publication of _Principia Mathematica,_ Hardy wrote a review for

the general public that appeared in the _Times Literary Supplement._ With
characteristic British humor, he stated, “Non-mathematical readers may very
naturally be frightened by an exaggerated notion of the technical difficulty of the
book.”

As for Ramanujan, he was the most phenomenally intuitive mathematician in

history. It is difficult to speak of him without recourse to superlatives. Our
vocabulary simply isn’t adequate. Even the word _genius_ seems too feeble.

The way he worked defies understanding. He simply wrote down bizarre


-----

formulas on pieces of paper headed by the word _theorem_ without giving the least
explanation of his thought processes.

When Hardy insisted upon the necessity of coming up with rigorous proofs,

Ramanujan responded that he didn’t see the need. He knew that the formulas
were correct, because his family’s goddess Namagiri Thayar had revealed them
to him in a dream.

I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall to see the expression on

the face of Hardy, a confirmed atheist and fervent rationalist, when Ramanujan
dared say such things.

In the course of his short career, Ramanujan produced more than thirty-nine

hundred “results.” What status should they be given? Normally, a theorem
without a proof is not a theorem but simply a conjecture. In any case, that’s the
official version.

A century after his death, his confirmed record is prodigious. Almost all of

his formulas have been shown to be correct. The search for proofs has inspired
the development of entire fields of mathematics and required the invention of
sophisticated new conceptual tools. This work involved mathematicians of the
first order over decades upon decades. We’re only just now beginning to have
the end in sight.


-----

-----

How did Ramanujan discover his formulas? Wasn’t his way of seeing them

the beginning of a proof, if not a complete but nonverbal proof? Did he really
have no way of saying more about it without invoking his goddess?

Under Hardy’s influence, Ramanujan was able to learn the rudiments of

“academic” mathematics. He finished his thesis and wrote a couple of articles
that contained actual proofs. However, he never succeeded in explaining his
work method. If he had lived longer, perhaps he would have been able to find a
way to better explain the images, colors, or structures, the tastes or the textures
that formed inside his head, and how he learned to invoke them.

If you really want to believe in magic or the existence of supermen with

supernatural powers, you might find some inspiration in the story of Ramanujan.

As for me, I’m siding with Misha Gromov, one of the greatest living

mathematicians (he received the Abel Prize in 2009). For Gromov, it would be a
mistake to attribute Ramanujan’s genius to some cosmic anomaly, a singularity
cut off from common human experience: “This miracle of Ramanujan forcefully
points toward the same universal principles that make possible mastering native
languages by billions of children.”

I suspect that Gromov’s affirmation is born of his personal experience, of the

intimate understanding he has of the mechanisms of his own creativity, which is
itself miraculous enough.

As we near the end of this book, I hope that a remark like Gromov’s no

longer comes as a surprise to you, and that it even seems quite natural.

## Someone Exactly Like You or Me

In Hardy’s review of _Principia Mathematica,_ lurking behind his British

sense of humor, you can discern a less sympathetic aspect of his personality: his
morbid elitism.

The review was written for a general audience, the readers of the _Times,_ on a

subject they had legitimate reasons to find intimidating: a 666-page book with a
Latin title that aspired to serve as a new foundation to logic, mathematics, and
human thought as a whole.

While admitting that “the general tone of the book is mathematical,” Hardy

prefers to insist on its philosophical implications and historical character,
employing a lighthearted tone that makes you think he enjoyed delving into it.

He correctly notes that the book contains “crazy looking symbolism” and

that “it would be silly to pretend that the book is not really difficult,” but that


-----

doesn’t prevent him from asserting, “It has many claims to be widely read.”
Hardy goes so far as to say that “some of the jokes are very good.”

At no point does he reveal the key to the enigma, the crucial advice my

friend Raphael gave me that I shared in chapter 6 . To anyone confronted with
_Principia Mathematica,_ this advice becomes a basic mental health tip: “Never
ever read math books.”

For Hardy, mathematics was a gentlemen’s club that only the select few

could enter. In his famous autobiography, _A Mathematician’s Apology,_ a book
that was once considered a classic but, to modern readers, seems plainly
obnoxious, Hardy goes so far as to proclaim this malediction: “There is no scorn
more profound, or on the whole more justifiable, than that of the men who make
for the men who explain. Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for secondrate minds.”

The brutal elitism of the mathematical community is unfortunately a topic on

its own. It’s a tradition that goes back centuries.

In the academic world, mathematicians build their careers and legitimacy

upon the new theorems they prove, and upon nothing else. All the rest doesn’t
really count, apart from the rare conjectures that become famous in themselves
and confer a special prestige.

This system has its merits. It reduces arbitrariness and helps mathematicians

guard against complacency and nepotism. When a discipline deals with eternal
truths, it offers a neat way to evaluate careers.

The approach also has its blind spots. Hardy’s curse remains very potent and

no one is immune to it. In the research community, an exaggerated interest in
mathematical education is commonly perceived as a sign of weakness.
Fortunately, mathematicians have started to change their opinions in this issue.
They have learned to _slightly less_ despise teaching and popularization. But
there’s still a long way to go.

The secret math, the one that deals with human understanding, will never

possess the rigor and objectivity of official math. Because of this, it will never be
considered as a “serious” topic.

This “nonserious” topic, however, is arguably much more important than

most properly mathematical questions.

It concerns anyone who at one moment or another has been faced with

learning math—that is to say, absolutely everyone. Mathematicians themselves
are passionate about it, and it regularly comes up in their private conversations.
It raises fundamental questions about human intelligence, language, and how our
brains work.


-----

It would be a terrible mistake to confine this subject to the backstage of

science, to late-night conversations and the autobiographies of retired
mathematicians. It would equally be a shame to exile it from the field of
mathematics and make it the exclusive domain of neurology.

Failing to place human understanding at the center of mathematics is failing

to acknowledge the very nature of mathematics.

Undoubtedly we did not have, until quite recently, the tools and the

framework to approach the subject in a constructive manner. We were
collectively trapped in fatalism and passivity: “Some people in this world are
incredibly brilliant at math, but it’s no use trying to figure out why, it’s simply a
miracle, a gift from heaven. And too bad for those who can’t understand.”

This “nonserious” but burning topic is the subject of this book. I have tried to

approach it in my own way, starting from a simple premise: talking about math
as I have experienced it, in the simplest way possible, examining what it _really_
consists of, the things you do inside your head, and how to approach it
_concretely._

If Hardy had known the right questions to ask Ramanujan, who knows what

we might have learned? Fortunately we have the writings of Descartes,
Grothendieck, Thurston, and of course Einstein.

It’s hard to overestimate the value of these writings. Their most troubling

message, the most powerful and subversive, is this: we construct our intelligence
on our own, with ordinary human means, with our imagination, curiosity, and
sincerity.

Grothendieck wrote: “The man who first discovered and mastered fire was

someone exactly like you or me. Not at all what you’d call a ‘hero,’ or ‘demigod,’ or whatever.”

Descartes and Einstein said essentially the same thing, albeit in different

words. We sliced their brains into sections and put their skulls into museums—
but we refused to listen.

## What to Do about All of This?

I wrote this as a kind of handbook, something that I would have loved to

have on my nightstand during my studies to guide me, to encourage me, to help
overcome my inhibitions. I believe it would have helped me immensely. I hope
it will help you.

My ambition isn’t to make math easier. It never will be, not for anyone. It’s

not math’s job to be easy. I simply want to make it more accessible, to allow


-----

those who want to explore it be able to do so, according to their desire and
ambition.

There will always be some people who are better at math than others: the

visionaries, the passionate, the adventurous. But pretending that being good at
math requires a special gift is a lie. Math belongs to all of us. There’s no reason
to accept being petrified and giving up, neither for ourselves nor for others.

One of the great lessons math has taught me is that it’s only by confronting

head-on our impression of not understanding something that we have a chance to
finally understand it. It seems that scrutinizing our own perplexity is the best
way to mobilize our natural faculties for learning.

This is precisely why math is difficult: it requires looking straight at what is

beyond our comprehension. We must become genuinely interested in it. We
must force ourselves to imagine it and put words to all our impressions, without
being distracted by our constant feeling of inferiority. And we must do that
precisely when our instinct tells us to run away as quickly as we can.

For Descartes, math is the only place where one can fully experience what it

means to _understand_ something.

This is also what I personally get from math. Math has taught me to pay

attention to that special taste in my mouth, this impression that something’s not
quite right and doesn’t work like it should. It has taught me to recognize a novel
idea when it still looks like nothing, to nurture it and pay close attention, so that
it has a chance to grow. It has taught me to listen to my emotions.

I know now that my candor and my sensitivity are my most powerful

intellectual weapons. The mathematical approach is one of integrity and being in
tune with oneself.

Using this approach, I formed habits that I’ve kept to this day. I stopped

believing that there were things that were counterintuitive by nature. The things
we’re told are “counterintuitive” or “paradoxical” are either false or poorly
explained.

No one is forcing us to live in a world that is indecipherable and incoherent.

By adopting the right habits and developing our confidence in our ability to
_imagine_ and to _formalize,_ we can continually grow our mental clarity.

If we teach math to children, it’s not so much in order to teach them about

numbers and shapes as to give them the chance to approach the world in this
manner.

Understanding things is one of the great pleasures in life. This pleasure is

sometimes spoiled by a feeling of regret for lost time: _How is it I was so stupid_
_not to have understood this earlier?_


-----

I’ve known this feeling for so long that I no longer pay any attention to it. As

the saying goes, the best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago; the second
best time is now.

If you think you’re terrible at math, and this book makes you want to try

again, keep this in mind: there are nice stories about climbing Mount Everest,
some even read like novels, but nothing beats training. For beginners, the first
few yards of the climb can be the hardest.

My advice is to have no shame in starting at the beginning, with the most

classical and elementary proofs. Since it won’t be easy for you to know if you
really understand them, try explaining them to someone else, perhaps a child.

When we try explaining things to others, we often realize that our own ideas

aren’t as clear as we thought. It’s a painful and humiliating experience, but one
that you can get over, and it’s precisely by getting over it that you get ahead in
math.

My only way of understanding things is to explain them to myself, in the

simplest terms possible, as if I were a child. It’s the same principle that I used to
write this book.

In “On Proof and Progress in Mathematics,” Thurston gave this beautiful

definition: “Mathematicians are those humans who advance human
understanding of mathematics.”

That’s exactly what I’ve tried to do.

## Notes and Further Reading

Chapter 1. Three Secrets

“I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.” The original sentence, “Ich habe keine

besondere Begabung, sondern bin nur leidenschaftlich neugierig,” is taken from a letter from Einstein to his
biographer Carl Seelig, dated March 11, 1952.

“Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater” is taken

from a letter from Einstein to Barbara Wilson, a high school student, dated January 7, 1943.

“I believe in intuition and inspiration” is from an interview with Einstein by George Sylvester Viereck

published in the _Saturday Evening Post,_ October 26, 1929.

Many of Einstein’s quotations that you come across are incorrect or altered. Those that I cite in this

work have been sourced and verified thanks to _The Ultimate Quotable Einstein,_ a collection of verified
citations by Alice Calaprice (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2011).

Chapter 2. The Right Side of the Spoon

Math is the subject:

—the most difficult for 37 percent of 1,028 American adolescents surveyed by Gallup in a 2004 poll. See

Lydia Saad, “Math Problematic for U. S. Teens,” _Gallup,_ May 17, 2005, or online at
[https://news.gallup.com/poll/16360/math-problematic-us-teens.aspx](https://news.gallup.com/poll/16360/math-problematic-us-teens.aspx) .

—the most liked for 23 percent of American adolescents, far more than English (13 percent), according to a

study by Gallup in 2004 of 785 Americans aged thirteen to seventeen. See Heather Mason Kiefer,
“Math = Teens Favorite School Subject,” _Gallup,_ June 15, 2004, or online at
[https://news.gallup.com/poll/12007/Math-Teens-Favorite-School-Subject.aspx](https://news.gallup.com/poll/12007/Math-Teens-Favorite-School-Subject.aspx) .

—the most hated according to countless surveys, of whatever population.

Chapter 3. The Power of Thought

In this chapter, the ability to “see” a circle in one’s head is presented as a universal human capability,

which isn’t entirely correct. In 2015, a research team led by Adam Zeman at the University of Exeter
described a rare condition, _aphantasia,_ characterized by the inability to create mental imagery. A 2022
study estimates the prevalence of complete aphantasia at around 1 percent. See
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia) for details and references.

When writing this book, I was faced with the challenge of describing what’s going on inside our heads.

It was natural for me to put an emphasis on the visual experience, as it is easy to convey and most people
find it striking. My apologies to readers with aphantasia, who may occasionally feel left out.

One reader with aphantasia reached out after the original edition was published, and I had the

opportunity to discuss this chapter with him. While he can’t “see” the line sweeping across the circle, he


-----

does find “obvious” that a line cannot intersect a circle in more than two points (without being able to
provide a reason).

This lone testimonial is by no way a robust scientific study, but it does help illustrate a key point that is

reasserted in chapter 16 : mathematical intuition comes in many shapes and forms. It doesn’t have to be
visual.

Chapter 4. Real Magic

The number 999,999,999 would have been easy to write in the Babylonian sexagesimal system invented

four thousand years ago, well before the Roman era.

Even though it is difficult to write in Roman numerals, the number itself is easily calculated using an

abacus, which the Romans used, and which is implicitly decimal. The problem comes in writing it down
outside of the abacus.

After the classical era, Roman numerals were extended to express 1 million, 1 billion, and so on. But

writing the number 999,999,999 continues to pose a problem despite these extensions, since you have to use
many symbols: just writing “9 million” means you have to use the symbol for million nine times.

“I think quite a few kids will begin trying it my way now. I don’t guarantee results, and I don’t

recommend my style to anyone.” Cited in Joseph Durso, “Fosbury Flop Is a Gold Medal Smash,” _New York_

Chapter 7. The Child’s Pose

The “ridiculous piece” letter appears in Alexander Grothendieck and Jean-Pierre Serre, _Correspondance_

_Grothendieck-Serre,_ ed. Pierre Colmez et Jean-Pierre Serre (Paris, Société mathématique de France, 2001).
A bilingual edition was jointly published by the American Mathematical Society and the Société
mathématique de France in 2004.

Grothendieck’s exact words are “emmerdante rédaction,” which is powerfully expressive in a way that

is hard to render in polite English (“annoying write-up” is way too mild).

The quotations from Serre are taken from a fascinating conversation with Alain Connes (himself a first-

rate mathematician and recipient of the Fields Medal in 1982) at the Fondation Hugot du Collège de France
on November 27, 2018. This exceptional insight into the personalities of Grothendieck and Serre is
available online at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOv-ygSynRI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOv-ygSynRI) .

Unless otherwise noted, Grothendieck’s quotations are taken from _Récoltes et semailles: Réflexions et_

_témoignage sur un passé de mathématicien_ (Harvests and Sowings: Reflections and Testimonials on a
Mathematician’s Past), 2 vols. (Paris: Gallimard, 2022). MIT Press is preparing an English-language
edition.


-----

In the 1980s Grothendieck had expected the work to be published by éditions Christian Bourgois. He

had even written an introductory foreword. In the end, however, this publication never came about.

The esoteric nature of the text doesn’t fully explain why such a major work remained unpublished for so

long. A more direct explanation lies in the unfounded accusations contained in the manuscript, which
Grothendieck refused to edit out. Notably, he accused his students of having abandoned his work and
“buried” him, which is absurd (on this subject see Serre’s spot-on response in his letter to Grothendieck of
July 23, 1985). Other accusations were outright defamatory and would have exposed the publisher to
charges of libel.

During the 2000s, a collective called the Grothendieck Circle worked to edit and make openly

accessible many other unpublished texts and documents, _Harvests and Sowings,_ for one, but also _La clef des_
_songes_ (The key to dreams), another remarkable yet deeply esoteric text.

This work was interrupted after Grothendieck circulated a “declaration of the intention not to publish”

dated January 3, 2010, in which he affirmed the following: “I have no intention of publishing, or of republishing, any work or text, in whatever form, of which I am the author. . . . Any publication or
dissemination of such texts which have appeared in the past without my consent, or which may appear in
the future during my lifetime, against my express wishes detailed herein, is in my view illegal.”

However, one month later, on February 3, 2010, Grothendieck reaffirmed the importance of _Harvests_

_and Sowings_ in a letter to the mathematician Frans Oort, cited in Ching-Li Chai and Frans Oort, “Life and
Work of Alexander Grothendieck,” _Notice ICCM_ 5, no. 1 (2017): 22–50. It is also the source of this quote
(originally in English): “This ‘Reflection and Testimonial’ on my life as a mathematician, unreadable as it
is I admit, has much meaning for me, if not to anyone else!”

An excellent introduction to Grothendieck’s biography is Allyn Jackson’s two-part article, “ _Comme_

_Appelé du Néant—_ As If Summoned from the Void: The Life of Alexandre Grothendieck,” _Notices of the_
_American Mathematical Society_ 50, no. 4 (2004): 1038–56, and 51, no. 10 (2004): 1196–1212, online at

Chapter 8. The Theory of Touch

The pages describing the theory of touch in terms of points and pits are written in a style that is

reminiscent of actual mathematical research articles. If you liked this passage, you would probably also like
official mathematics.

Chapter 9. Something’s Going on Here

In three dimensions, there are five convex regular polyhedra (the correct definition of _regular_ is a bit

technical, but it implies that all faces are identical regular polygons): the tetrahedron (four faces), the cube
(six faces), the octahedron (eight faces), the dodecahedron (twelve faces), and the icosahedron (twenty
faces). These five polyhedra have been known for millennia, and are notably mentioned in one of Plato’s
dialogues, _Timaeus._ Even though Plato simply reproduced a knowledge that had long preceded him, these
five polyhedra have since become known as Platonic solids.

The notion of a regular polyhedron generalizes to any dimension; one then speaks of _regular polytopes_ .

These have been entirely classified, most notably thanks to the work of Ludwig Schläfli (1814–1895) and
H. S. M. Coxeter (1907–2003). The classification leads to a very particular phenomenon in eight
dimensions, with an exceptional and remarkable object called _E_ _8_ _,_ which will reappear in the notes to
chapter 15 .

“He’s better than me.” Grothendieck made this comment about Deligne in a private conversation with

George Mostow (1923–2017), who repeated it to me personally.

Pierre Deligne’s Abel Prize interview took the form of a conversation with two mathematicians, Martin

Chapter 10. The Art of Seeing

Bill Thurston’s childhood is recounted in David Gabai and Steve Kerckhoff, eds., “William P. Thurston,

1946–2012,” _Notices of the American Mathematical Society_ 62, no. 11 (December 2015): 1318–32, and 63,
no. 1 (January 2016): 31–41, online at [http://www.ams.org/notices/201511/rnoti-p1318.pdf](http://www.ams.org/notices/201511/rnoti-p1318.pdf) and
[https://www.ams.org/notices/201601/rnoti-p31.pdf](https://www.ams.org/notices/201601/rnoti-p31.pdf) .

As for Thurston’s geometric intuition, I highly recommend the animated film _Outside In,_ adapted from

one of his proofs and produced by the Geometry Center of the University of Minnesota, as well as the
Landau Lectures, a series of classes given by Thurston in 1996 at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. All
of these videos are easily accessible online.

As regards color blindness (“Daltonism”): the frequency given of 8 percent for men is an estimation

given for the population of northern Europe ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness) ). It stems from a
coding error that blocks the expression of a protein and is thus a recessive mutation, and the gene is carried
by chromosome X. From this and basic math, one can explain why the frequency among women is the
square of that among men.

Dalton’s original article, “Extraordinary Facts relating to the Vision of Colors,” which appeared in

1798, indicates that the communication occurred on October 31, 1794. The article is remarkably well
written and is perfectly readable even today.

“People don’t understand how I can visualize in four or five dimensions.” Thurston’s comments are

reported in Leslie Kaufman, “William P. Thurston, Theoretical Mathematician, Dies at 65,” _New York_

The documentary _The Boy Who Sees without Eyes_ (2007), directed by Elliot McCaffrey and available

online, gives you an idea of the abilities of Ben Underwood. Studies of human echolocation suggest that,
for the sightless, this faculty mobilizes regions of the brain which, for the sighted, deal with visual
information ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_echolocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_echolocation) ).

Chapter 14. A Martial Art

“Like an elephant or a panther”: the quotations are taken from a letter from Descartes to Pierre Chanut

dated March 3, 1649, in _Oeuvres de Descartes,_ ed. Charles Adam and Paul Tannery (Léopold Cerf, 1897–
1913), available at Wikisource, [https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki](https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki) . Chanut was not only the French ambassador
to Sweden but a close friend of Descartes’s.

Descartes wrote _Discourse on Method_ in French (the full original title is _Discours de la méthode pour_

_bien conduire sa raison, et chercher la vérité dans les sciences_ ). Choosing the vernacular, not Latin, was a
major departure from the scholarly norms of his time. Descartes explained that he wanted his message to
reach a wide audience, far beyond the (then all-male) world of academia and theology, and be “understood
by women and children.”

The quotations are from the English translation by Ian Maclean (Oxford: Oxford University Press,

2006.)

Descartes’s recollection of his three dreams appeared in a text that has since been lost, _Olympica,_ which

is known only from a transcription made by Adrien Baillet (1649–1706), his first biographer, in _La vie de_
_Monsieur Descartes_ (1691). Baillet had access to many original documents and direct statements, and his
text remains the unique reference for many aspects of the life and work of Descartes, including the eventful
night of November 10–11, 1619.

All quotations and details regarding the dreams rely on Baillet’s unverifiable paraphrase of _Olympica_ .

Baillet is also our only source for the information regarding _L’art d’escrime_ (The art of fencing).

Echoing the themes of chapter 6 , one also finds in Baillet’s book this interesting side comment about

Descartes: “It must nevertheless be admitted that he did not read a great deal, that he had few books, and
that most of them found among his possessions at his death were gifts from friends.”

_Rules for the Direction of the Mind_ was written in Latin ( _Regulae ad Directionem Ingenii_ ). The

quotations are from the English translation by John Cottingham, Robert Stoothoff, and Dugald Murdoch,
_The Philosophical Writings of Descartes_ (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985).

Chapter 15. Awe and Magic

The anecdotes and quotations about Cantor are taken from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor) .
Here is a rough outline of how one can build an actual “proof” that a trefoil and an unknot are truly

different. A general strategy to prove that two knots are different is to identify a “knot invariant” that
differentiates them. An invariant of a knot is a common characteristic shared among all its drawings (also
called _diagrams_ ), however complicated they may be.

“Tricolorability” is a simple knot invariant that does the job here. By definition, a knot diagram is said

to be _tricolorable_ if you can color each “piece” of the diagram (meaning the visually apparent pieces of the
diagram, obtained by considering that a line passing beneath another one is “cut” in two at the intersection)
by using three distinct colors and respecting these rules:

—Each piece must be entirely painted with a single color.
—All three colors must be used, each at least once.
—At each intersection, the three pieces involved in the intersection (that which is “on top” and the two

“beneath”) must be either of three distinct colors or all of the same color.

Even though it’s not obvious at first glance, you can prove that tricolorability really is a knot invariant

(that is, whether a knot diagram is tricolorable depends only on the knot and not on the actual diagram). To
prove this, one first uses a theorem of Kurt Reidemeister (1893–1971) that states that two diagrams
represent the same knot if and only if you can go from the first diagram to the second by a series of basic
transformations, the _Reidemeister moves_ (proving this theorem is a bit technical). One then observes that the
Reidemeister moves preserve tricolorability (this part is easier.)

For example, a trefoil knot is tricolorable, whereas an unknot is obviously not (it consists of a single


-----

piece and thus you can’t use three different colors).

If a trefoil knot were the same as an unknot, they would either both be tricolorable or neither would.

Thus, by exhibiting a knot invariant that differentiates them, you prove that they are two distinct knots.

Even if this allows you to prove the result, the definition of tricolorability seems as arbitrary as the

famous “trick” for calculating the sum of whole numbers from 1 to 100.

As always, this apparent “trick” is the sign that there is a more profound way to understand what is

happening. I am unfortunately personally unable to explain it simply. It involves a kind of intuition that is
difficult to communicate in just a few words.

As regards complicated diagrams of unknots, there is an interesting discussion thread started on the site

MathOverflow by Timothy Gowers, Fields medalist 1998 (“Are There Any Very Hard Unknots?”
[https://mathoverflow.net/questions/53471/are-there-any-very-hard-unknots](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/53471/are-there-any-very-hard-unknots) ).

The “complicated” diagram of an unknot shown in this chapter is the so-called “gordian knot.” It’s from

the German mathematician Wolfgang Haken (1928–2022), best known from having proved, with Kenneth
Appel, the famous “four colors theorem.”

A short YouTube video entitled _Haken’s Gordian Knot Animation_ illustrates why this diagram

represents an unknot ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hznI5HXpPfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hznI5HXpPfE) ).

About Kepler’s conjecture: even though the proof by Tom Hales requires a phenomenal amount of

computer calculations, it also contains a profound and original “conceptual” component. It’s not at all
evident a priori that the conjecture could be reduced to a _finite_ number of calculations and that these
calculations _in practice_ could be done on a computer.

Proofs making use of computers are a topic of debate among the math community: if no human can read

and understand them, should we really consider them as being proofs? And how can we check that the
software is itself correct?

Following his initial proof, Tom Hales started the ambitious project of “formalizing” his proof, that is,

in producing a computer-based proof that could verify its own validity. Hales’s attempt met with success.
It’s explained in a research presentation entitled _Formalizing the Proof of the Kepler Conjecture_ available
on YouTube at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJx8bFQbHsA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJx8bFQbHsA) . This presentation, given by Hales in
Paris in 2014, wasn’t meant for a general audience, which makes it even more interesting for outsiders, as
an opportunity to get a feel for the “living” reality of contemporary math research.

As regards dimensions 8 and 24, an explanation of why it is possible to determine the densest sphere

packings lies in the existence of exceptional geometric structures that are specific to these dimensions and
give rise to unusually dense packings. The methods used by Maryna Viazovska rely on these particular
phenomena and are specific to these dimensions.

In dimension 8 the exceptional structure is called _E_ _8_ (see the notes for chapter 9 on the classification of

polytopes). In the associated sphere packing, the number of contacts between neighboring spheres (what is


-----

called the _kissing number_ ) is 240.

In dimension 24, the geometry of the pile is that of the “Leech lattice,” an exceptional structure specific

to dimension 24 ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leech_lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leech_lattice) ). The kissing number of 196,560 evokes the
dimension 196,883 mentioned in chapter 20 and associated with the “Monster.” It’s not a coincidence.
Mathematicians know that these kinds of numerological oddities are often the sign of much more profound
connections. The Monster, one of the most intriguing math objects, is connected to a number of other
exceptional structures, most famously through the “monstrous moonshine” (see
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine) ).

Chapter 17. Controlling the Universe

Concerning the Unabomber, apart from the Wikipedia page, which is quite extensive, our principal

sources are:

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm) .

—On the details concerning the attacks and the investigation, see the conference given on November 19,

—Bill Thurston’s role in the investigation is related by Steven G. Krantz in _Mathematical Apocrypha:_

_Stories and Anecdotes of Mathematicians and the Mathematical_ (Mathematical Association of America,
2002).

The first quotation (undoubtedly false) attributed to Grisha Perelman (“What would I do with a million

dollars when I can already control the universe?”) was reported by a “journalist and producer” who claimed
to be a close friend of Perelman’s who was preparing a documentary on him. The quotation was repeated in
the Russian tabloid _Komsomolskaïa Pravda._ The documentary was never produced and the source is
doubtful.

The second of Perelman’s quotes (“Money and fame don’t interest me”) comes from the article

“Russian Maths Genius Perelman Urged to Take $1m Prize,” _BBC News,_ March 24, 2010,
[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8585407.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8585407.stm) .

The discussion on the collaborative site MathOverflow between Bill Thurston and Muad is available

online at [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/43690/whats-a-mathematician-to-do](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/43690/whats-a-mathematician-to-do) . It should be noted that
Thurston’s comment “I try to write what seems real. By now, I have no cause to fear how I will be judged,
which makes it much easier for me” speaks to the theme taken up in the epilogue: in order to recount the
human experience of understanding, mathematicians need to overcome the reticence of their community to
discuss subjects that “aren’t serious.” Even world-class mathematicians can be intimidated by Hardy’s
curse.

Chapter 18. The Elephant in the Room

The _species problem,_ the impossibility of rigorously defining what constitutes an animal species, is a

well-known epistemological problem that has been widely discussed.

The _paradox of the heap_ (also known as the _sorites paradox_ from the Greek word for heap) is among

the other classic problems that show the fuzziness of human language. If you take a grain of sand from a


-----

heap, it remains a heap of sand, but if you continue, at some point it ceases to be a heap. But at what point is
the limit? This problem, like that of the bald man (if you take one hair from the head of a man, that doesn’t
make him bald, but can you really define the border between being bald and not being bald?), is generally
attributed to Eubulides, a Greek philosopher of the fourth century BCE.

The quotations from Ludwig Wittgenstein are taken from paragraphs 106 and 107 of _Philosophical_

_Investigations,_ 4th ed. (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009), a text completed in 1949 and published
posthumously in 1953. At the beginning of his career, however, Wittgenstein seemed close to the logicist
position of Bertrand Russell (see my epilogue), as opposed to the preoccupations of _Philosophical_
_Investigations._ The later works of Wittgenstein are an excellent complement to this chapter as well as to
chapter 19 . The most accessible is perhaps _On Certainty,_ a short text assembled posthumously from his
notes (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 1975).

Chapter 19. Abstract and Vague

The question of the nature of abstract concepts is known in philosophy as “the problem of universals.”

The “realist” position holds that the concepts are “real” things, that they exist independently of human
cognition. The “nominalist” position (and its “conceptualist” variant) holds that they are verbal constructs
(or things that exist only in our heads). Historically, the realist position was dominant. During the Middle
Ages in Europe the question was the object of a heated debate known as “the quarrel of universals,” stoked
notably by the positions taken by Pierre Abélard (1079–1142) and William of Ockham (1285–1347), whose
conceptualist stances were condemned by the Church. In a sense, deep learning has vindicated them.

As for the specialization of neurons, a famous article that appeared in _Nature_ describes the observation

of a “Jennifer Aniston neuron” that reacts specifically to the presence of the actress in an image. See R.
Quian Quiroga, L. Reddy, G. Kreiman, et al., “Invariant Visual Representation by Single Neurons in the
Human Brain,” _Nature,_ no. 435 (2005): 1102–7.

Chapter 20. A Mathematical Awakening

The two quotations from Bill Thurston are taken from his preface to _The Best Writing on Mathematics,_

_2010,_ ed. Mircea Pitici (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2011).

The quotations from Grothendieck are from _Harvests and Sowings._
The article by Bob Thomason and Tom Trobaugh is “Higher Algebraic K-Theory of Schemes and of

Derived Categories,” in _The Grothendieck Festschrift,_ vol. 3 (Boston: Birkhäuser, 1990), 247–429.

Philosophy of mathematics has traditionally framed the debate on the “existence” of the parallel world

of perfect mathematical entities as an opposition between Platonism (which posits that it does exist) and
formalism (which posits that mathematics is nothing more than ink on paper, subject to a typographical
game of mechanical deduction).

In “Some Proposals for Reviving the Philosophy of Mathematics,” _Advances in Mathematics_ 31 (1979):

31–50, Reuben Hersh (1927–2020) rightly points out that “the typical ‘working mathematician’ is a
Platonist on weekdays and a formalist on Sundays.”

Indeed, you can’t do any work without projecting yourself into a fantasy world where mathematical

objects “truly exist,” but when your in-laws become inquisitive about your job, it’s safer to characterize it as
anchored in computer-like calculations.

Hersh states that both positions are equally untenable and the whole debate is entirely pointless: “The

alternative of Platonism and formalism comes from the attempt to root mathematics in some nonhuman
reality. If we give up the obligation to establish mathematics as a source of indubitable truths, we can accept
its nature as a certain kind of human mental activity.”

Hersh’s brilliant 1979 article is the earliest instance I could find in the literature where the notion that

_mathematics is best defined as a particular human activity_ is articulated in full clarity, decades ahead of
Thurston.

Epilogue

In his first letter to G. H. Hardy, dated January 16, 1913, Srinivasa Ramanujan claimed he was twenty-

three years old. Born in December 1887, he would actually have been twenty-five. I can find no explanation
for this discrepancy.

Hardy’s review of _Principia Mathematica_ is “The New Symbolic Logic,” _Times Literary Supplement,_

September 7, 1911.

It was to Hardy that Russell recounted having had the following nightmare: in the distant future, there

remains only a single copy of _Principia Mathematica,_ kept in a large university library. An employee of the
library is charged with searching the shelves for books that have become useless in order to free up more
space. The employee picks up the last copy of _Principia Mathematica_ and hesitates. (This anecdote is
reported by Hardy in _A Mathematician’s Apology_ [1940; repr., Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
1992].)

Beyond its inhuman character, the formalist project that underpins _Principia Mathematica_ is also

problematic from a logical perspective. Kurt Gödel (1906–1978) famously proved with his 1931
incompleteness theorems that formal systems such as those in _Principia Mathematica_ always contain
“undecidable” statements (that is, statements that are not provable, and whose negation is also not
provable.)

As a first-year student at the école normale supérieure, I followed a course given by Xavier Viennot in

which he introduced us to peculiar “intuitive” objects, akin to Lego or Tetris blocks, that we could mentally
manipulate to find “visually evident” some of Ramanujan’s results. This mind-blowing experience changed
my entire perception of mathematics: I realized that formulas as esoteric as those of Ramanujan could in
fact transcribe nonverbal intuitions that were both simple and subtle. A good illustration of his approach is
the presentation he gave in Chennai (formerly Madras) in 2019: “Proofs without Words: The Example of
Ramanujan Continued Fractions”; notes:
[http://www.xavierviennot.org/coursIMSc2017/lectures_files/RamanujanInst_2017.pdf](http://www.xavierviennot.org/coursIMSc2017/lectures_files/RamanujanInst_2017.pdf) ; video recording:

## Acknowledgments

My deepest thanks go to Hélène François, my first reader, for her generosity,

heart, and visionary spirit. This book owes much to her.

My friends Farouk Boucekkine, Michel Broué, Nicolas Cohen, Hélène

Devynck, Marion Gouget, Basile Panurgias, and Jérôme Soubiran have been my
test readers and sparring partners throughout the initial writing phase. I also owe
a lot to them.

This first English-language edition is much more than a translation. English

has long been my exclusive language for writing mathematics, and I initially
thought that it would be the best language for me to write _about_ mathematics.
However, I wanted this book to be emotionally accurate. It soon became obvious
that I would never achieve this without switching to French, the language of the
_child within me_ . Ironically, still, many passages spontaneously came to me in
English, and I had to mentally translate them into French.

My secret plan was for the first English version to be a full-fledged second

edition. I am extremely grateful to Jean Thomson Black and Yale University
Press for allowing this to happen, and for sparing no efforts.

Working with Kevin Frey was a pleasure. His initial translation was already

in tune with my own internal voice, which made the revision effort natural and
easy for me. This process took place directly in English, with Kevin and I
working hand in hand. There are no major changes compared to the original
edition, but a few sections have been rewritten and clarified, and there are many
small tweaks at the sentence and paragraph levels. I thank Kevin for his patience
and curiosity. I also thank the three anonymous reviewers who provided detailed
feedback on this edition, and the countless readers who reached out with
comments on the original edition and helped me understand where it could be
improved.

I thank the whole team at Yale University Press, especially Elizabeth Sylvia

and Joyce Ippolito. Thanks to Robin DuBlanc for the copyediting.


-----

When my original editor, Mireille Paolini, first read the manuscript, she

commented that it was an American book written in French. I hope that she’ll
like this version. I thank Mireille for her absolute confidence and relentless
commitment. Thanks to the entire team at éditions du Seuil, in particular Adrien
Bosc, Hugues Jallon, Séverine Nikel, Emmanuelle Bigot, Muriel Brami,
Bénédicte Gerber, Joséphine Gross, Virginie Perrollaz, and of course Maria
Vlachou and the international rights team. Thanks to éléonore Lamoglia, who
produced the beautiful illustrations.

Thanks to Ardavan Beigui, Fabrice Bertrand, Simon Boissinot, Emmanuel

Breuillard, Olivia Custer, Lucas Dernov, Maxime Dernov, Nicolas François,
Artem Kozhevnikov, Vincent Levy, François Loeser, Raphaël Rouquier, Vincent
Schächter, Claudia Senik, Marguerite Soubiran, Sarah Stern, Solal Stern,
Maxime Verner, and Agathe Vernin, whose careful reading and comments have
made this a much better book.

For their help with documentation and permissions, thanks to Sophie

Kucoyanis and éditions Gallimard, MIT Press, Mike Bossley, Steve Krantz,
Laurent Fleury, David Gabai, Steven Kerckhoff, and Rachel Findley.

I thank the people who taught me how to think.
